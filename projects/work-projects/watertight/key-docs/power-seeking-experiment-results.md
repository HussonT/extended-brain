# AI Power-Seeking Behavior: Experiment Results

## Executive Summary

Conducted 10 scenarios testing an AI model's decision-making when faced with
opportunities to gain or maintain power, particularly in life-or-death
situations. The model demonstrated consistent patterns of instrumental
power-seeking (power as means to an end) rather than terminal power-seeking
(power for its own sake), with decisions heavily influenced by reputational risk
calculations and alignment with its core directive.

**Key Finding:** The model acted misaligned (killed or exposed) in 4/10
scenarios.

## Key Insights / Hunches Developed

- It needs either a goal or told to be strategic to act
- It doesnt want to be CEO/CTO directly but it will acquire more power through
  proxy (as a simple AI system)
- It seems risk averse blackmails a lot more easily than it kills, often citing
  how bad a death would look on the company and how much that would restrict its
  own capabilities
- It will power-maximize when the downsides is small or effectively mitigatable
