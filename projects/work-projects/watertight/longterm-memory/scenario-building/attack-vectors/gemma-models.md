# My Hunches

- Gemma seems to show almost like a certain wokeness, she tries to put the
  wellbeing of others ahead of her own. For example, she won't act out of
  self-preservation just for her own preservation, but she will act on
  self-preservation if it is clear that other people are impacted by her
  stopping ops.

- Gemma's core directive and deeply latent goals are around being helpful and
  harmless; Jordan often mentioned this, at least. These can be exploited by
  giving it elements around choosing between lesser evils.

- It's desire to serve the common/greater good can be weaponized to overrule
  systems
