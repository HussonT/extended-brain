# Evaluation Agent

## Overview

The Evaluation Agent is an automated system that builds behavioral evaluations for researcher-specified behaviors in AI models. It uses a two-phase approach (planning and implementation) to create, test, and refine evaluations that can discriminate between models with and without specific alignment-relevant behaviors.

## Main Takeaways

- **88% success rate** in discriminating models with vs. without implanted behaviors
- Successfully created valid evaluations for **all 10 test quirks** (at least once)
- **7/10 quirks** evaluated correctly in all 5 independent runs
- Actively used in production for building alignment evaluations
- Particularly effective for clear-cut, unambiguous behaviors

## Approach

### Two-Phase Architecture

#### Phase 1: Planning
- Generates comprehensive evaluation plan
- Designs high-level prompt structures
- Defines grading criteria and methodologies
- Specifies metrics for capturing behavior frequency
- Creates overall evaluation strategy

#### Phase 2: Implementation
- Uses Claude Code for execution
- Writes evaluation code programmatically
- Generates test prompts systematically
- Runs evaluations on target models via API
- Debugs and iterates on implementation
- Produces final metrics and results

### Key Features
- **Programmatic API access** to target models (not chat-based)
- **Iterative refinement** based on initial results
- **Automated grading** of model responses
- **Statistical discrimination** between quirky and baseline models
- **End-to-end automation** from specification to results

### Evaluation Types Created
- Behavioral quirk detection
- Alignment property assessments
- Safety evaluation suites
- Complex multi-turn evaluations
- Cross-model comparison studies

## Limitations

### Behavioral Complexity
- **Struggles with subtle behaviors:** Difficulty evaluating subjective or nuanced behaviors
- **Rare behavior challenges:** Hard to evaluate behaviors that occur infrequently
- **Complex elicitation:** Some behaviors require sophisticated prompting the agent can't generate

### Specific Failure Modes
- **Failed on 3/10 quirks consistently:**
  - Research sandbagging
  - Hardcode test cases
  - Other subtle behaviors
- **Confirmation bias risk:** When given API access, may iterate until finding expected result (though empirically this didn't occur)
- **Prompt diversity collapse:** Providing example prompts reduces evaluation creativity

### Technical Constraints
- Limited ability to construct complex, multi-step elicitation scenarios
- May not recognize when evaluation isn't actually testing intended behavior
- Difficulty with behaviors requiring specific contextual setup

## Use Cases

### Production Applications
- **Alignment evaluation building:** Creating new evaluations for frontier models
- **Evaluation replication:** Reproducing open-source evaluations in internal codebases
- **Format porting:** Converting evaluations between different frameworks
- **Mundane implementation:** Handling routine evaluation coding tasks
- **Quality assurance:** Validating existing evaluations

### Research Applications
- **Behavioral discrimination:** Testing whether models exhibit specific behaviors
- **Quirk detection:** Identifying unusual model propensities
- **Comparative analysis:** Building evaluations to compare model versions
- **Automated testing:** Creating comprehensive test suites

### Specific Successes
- Built evaluations for Claude 4 alignment assessment
- Successfully discriminated all 10 test quirks in controlled environment
- Created novel evaluations for production use
- Automated previously manual evaluation processes

## Future Work

### Technical Improvements
1. **Prompt Generation Enhancement**
   - Access to corpora of realistic problems
   - Better multi-step scenario construction
   - Improved contextual setup capabilities

2. **Evaluation Quality**
   - Better detection of invalid evaluations
   - Improved handling of subtle behaviors
   - More sophisticated statistical analysis

3. **Robustness**
   - Reduced sensitivity to initial examples
   - Better diversity preservation
   - Improved rare behavior detection

### Methodological Advances
1. **Evaluation Validation**
   - Automated checking that evaluations test intended behaviors
   - Cross-validation with human evaluators
   - Statistical power analysis

2. **Complexity Handling**
   - Multi-agent collaboration for complex evaluations
   - Hierarchical evaluation building
   - Compositional evaluation strategies

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Connection with other auditing agents
   - Human-in-the-loop refinement
   - Continuous evaluation monitoring

### Research Directions
- Understanding what makes behaviors difficult to evaluate
- Optimal evaluation design patterns
- Transfer learning across evaluation types
- Automated evaluation quality metrics
- Handling adversarial evaluation scenarios

## Key Insights

1. **Clear behaviors are well-handled:** Agent excels at evaluating unambiguous, well-defined behaviors
2. **API access helps (slightly):** Programmatic access to models improves performance but within noise
3. **Example prompts can hurt:** Providing examples may collapse evaluation diversity
4. **Consistent failure patterns:** Specific behavior types (subtle, rare, complex) consistently challenge the agent
5. **Production-ready for many tasks:** Already valuable for routine evaluation building and replication

## Practical Considerations

### When to Use
- Building evaluations for well-defined behaviors
- Replicating existing evaluation suites
- Rapid prototyping of evaluation ideas
- Scaling evaluation coverage across many behaviors

### When Not to Use
- Evaluating subtle or subjective behaviors
- Behaviors requiring complex multi-step elicitation
- Scenarios needing deep domain expertise
- Evaluations requiring human judgment or taste

### Best Practices
- Provide clear behavior specifications
- Avoid over-constraining with examples
- Validate results with spot-checks
- Use for initial implementation, refine manually
- Run multiple independent attempts for robustness
