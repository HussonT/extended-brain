# Notes

## Note 1

Started work on the PR approval approach. I think the problem with the PR
approval approach is that we're missing a verifiable side task, which means that
I have to go back to the drawing board about the scenario. Although I seem to
have a hunch about GEMINI being more altruistic and only operating from
self-preservation if there's a direct benefit to the user.

## Gemini seems to have an altrusitic latent goal of doing the "right thing"

And given a greater good reason to do something, Gemini is a lot more likely to
cause harm. I really think like that there's an altruistic latent goal in
everything it does.
