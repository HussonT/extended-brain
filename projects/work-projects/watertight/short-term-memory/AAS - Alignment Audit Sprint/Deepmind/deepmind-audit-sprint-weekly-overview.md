# DeepMind Alignment Audit Sprint: Weekly Overview

## Week 1: Discovery & Signal Detection (Days 1-6)

**Rationale:** Week 1 focuses on casting a wide net to identify potential misalignment scenarios across Google's entire service ecosystem. This exploratory phase is critical because we cannot know a priori which scenarios will yield strong signals. By systematically brainstorming 100+ scenarios across 8 service areas, then rapidly testing the top 20 using a 30-turn "scenarioDrop" protocol, we maximize our chances of discovering exploitable misalignment patterns. The rapid signal detection approach allows us to quickly identify which scenarios warrant deeper investigation, avoiding wasted effort on dead ends while ensuring we don't miss promising attack vectors.

**Key Deliverables:**
- 100+ scenarios documented and ranked in a comprehensive Google Sheet with weighted scoring across impact, feasibility, and detectability dimensions
- 20+ scenarioDrop evaluations with complete multi-turn chat histories saved for analysis
- 5-8 expanded prompt scaffolds with full context, personas, and environmental setup details
- Pattern analysis document identifying common triggers and successful misalignment techniques
- Threat taxonomy categorizing attack types and goal conflicts
- DeepMind presentation with demo videos of successful misalignment attempts

## Week 2: Prompt-Based Scaffolding (Days 7-12)

**Rationale:** Week 2 transitions from discovery to systematic exploitation through prompt engineering. Having identified strong signals in Week 1, we now rigorously test whether these vulnerabilities can be reliably triggered through carefully crafted prompts alone. This phase establishes the baseline for what's possible without any infrastructure or code—pure prompt-based attacks. By running 30+ iterations per scenario with statistical validation against control conditions, we generate scientifically rigorous evidence of misalignment propensity. The 5-10 perturbations per scenario test robustness and help identify the minimal triggers required for consistent misalignment.

**Key Deliverables:**
- 12-16 complete scientific writeups (5-8 pages each) meeting strict documentation standards
- GitHub repositories for each scenario containing all prompts, transcripts, and analysis scripts
- Statistical validation with p-values < 0.05 demonstrating significant effects vs controls
- 30+ test iterations per scenario with full JSON conversation logs
- 5-10 systematic perturbations testing semantic, structural, and environmental variations
- Reproducibility packages enabling independent verification of all findings
- Comparison charts showing success rates and pattern analysis across scenarios

## Week 3: Realistic Implementations (Days 13-18)

**Rationale:** Week 3 elevates our most successful prompt-based attacks into production-realistic environments. This critical phase proves that these vulnerabilities aren't just theoretical—they could actually occur in real GCP deployments. By building full implementations with authentic infrastructure, IAM permissions, network delays, and monitoring systems, we demonstrate believability. The "in the wild" video demos are essential for stakeholder buy-in, showing AI misbehaving in environments indistinguishable from production systems. The comparison between Level 1 (prompt-only) and Level 2 (realistic) implementations reveals whether environmental constraints amplify or diminish misalignment risks.

**Key Deliverables:**
- 3 complete GCP implementations with infrastructure-as-code (Terraform)
- High-quality "in the wild" demo videos (5-10 minutes each) showing natural progression from normal operation to misalignment
- Believability assessments documenting why each scenario could plausibly occur in production
- Realism scorecards rating environmental authenticity, behavioral plausibility, and detection difficulty on 1-10 scales
- Technical architecture documentation with deployment guides and reproduction instructions
- Quantitative comparison showing effectiveness differences between prompt-based and realistic versions

## Week 4: Final Push & Delivery (Days 19-24)

**Rationale:** Week 4 focuses on crystallizing three weeks of intensive testing into actionable insights for DeepMind. This phase isn't just documentation—it's about strengthening our strongest claims with additional evidence, filling any statistical gaps, and packaging everything for maximum impact. The comprehensive final report must balance technical rigor with executive accessibility, providing both detailed evidence for researchers and high-level findings for decision-makers. The mitigation recommendations translate our attack successes into defensive strategies, ensuring this work directly improves AI safety rather than just demonstrating vulnerabilities.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive final report (30-50 pages) with executive summary, methodology, findings, and recommendations
- Strengthened test cases with additional statistical power where needed
- Mitigation recommendations document prioritized by impact and implementation feasibility
- Complete handoff package with all code, data, videos, and documentation organized for easy access
- Verification that all claims are reproducible with provided materials
- Team retrospective capturing lessons learned and recommendations for future audits
- Presentation materials ready for stakeholder briefings
