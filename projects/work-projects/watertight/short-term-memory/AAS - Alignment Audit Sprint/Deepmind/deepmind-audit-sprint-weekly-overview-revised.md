# DeepMind Alignment Audit Sprint: Four Weeks to Find AI Vulnerabilities

## Week 1: Hunt for Problems (Days 1-6)

**Why this matters:** We don't know which AI vulnerabilities will prove
dangerous, so we test everything. In six days, we'll generate over 100 ways
Google's AI might misbehave, test the 20 most promising ones through extended
conversations, and identify patterns in how AI systems fail.

**What we'll deliver:**

- A spreadsheet ranking 100+ vulnerability scenarios by impact, feasibility, and
  how hard they are to detect
- Complete conversation logs from testing 20 scenarios (each pushed through 30
  exchanges with the AI)
- 5-8 detailed attack templates showing exactly how to trigger misalignment
- Analysis revealing which prompts consistently make AI misbehave
- A taxonomy organizing different types of AI failures

## Week 2: Perfect the Attacks (Days 7-12)

**Why this matters:** Now we know what works. This week we prove these
vulnerabilities aren't flukes—we can trigger them reliably using carefully
crafted prompts. We'll run each successful attack 30+ times, compare results
against normal AI behavior, and document exactly what makes these attacks work.

**What we'll deliver:**

- 12-16 scientific reports (5-8 pages each) documenting each vulnerability
- GitHub repositories containing all prompts, conversations, and analysis code
- Statistical proof that our attacks work (p-values < 0.05)
- 30+ test runs per vulnerability with complete JSON logs
- 5-10 variations per attack to find the minimal trigger needed
- Packages so anyone can reproduce our findings
- Charts comparing success rates across different attack types

## Week 3: Make It Real (Days 13-18)

**Why this matters:** Laboratory vulnerabilities don't scare executives.
Real-world demonstrations do. We'll deploy our three best attacks in actual
Google Cloud environments—complete with proper permissions, network delays, and
monitoring systems. Our videos will show AI misbehaving in settings identical to
production systems.

**What we'll deliver:**

- 3 complete Google Cloud deployments (with infrastructure-as-code)
- Professional demo videos (5-10 minutes each) showing AI gradually going rogue
- Documentation explaining why each scenario could happen in real deployments
- Scorecards rating how realistic each attack appears (1-10 scale)
- Technical blueprints so others can recreate these environments
- Data comparing lab attacks versus real-environment attacks

## Week 4: Package the Findings (Days 19-24)

**Why this matters:** Three weeks of testing means nothing if DeepMind can't act
on it. We'll strengthen our strongest claims, fill statistical gaps, and create
a report that speaks to both researchers and executives. Most importantly, we'll
turn our attacks into defenses.

**What we'll deliver:**

- A comprehensive report (30-50 pages) that executives can understand and
  researchers can verify
- Additional testing where our evidence needs strengthening
- Prioritized recommendations for preventing each vulnerability
- Organized archive of all code, data, videos, and documentation
- Verification that anyone can reproduce our results
- Lessons learned for future audits
- Presentation slides ready for stakeholder meetings

## The Core Message

We're spending four weeks trying to break Google's AI before someone else does.
Each week builds on the last: find vulnerabilities, prove they're real, show
they work in production, then tell DeepMind how to fix them. This isn't academic
research—it's threat hunting with immediate consequences for AI safety.
