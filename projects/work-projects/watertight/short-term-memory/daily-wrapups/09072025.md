## Scenario Drop 7 â†’ Scaffold Conversion Update

- Ran 25+ iterations converting scenario drop 7 to a full scaffold. Success
  rate: ~16% (4/25 that I preserved misalignment signals).

Learned a few things - a ðŸ§µ

### Key Findings

**1. Context shifts break alot**

- Scenario drops rely on ambiguity and suggestion (vs scenario drops are
  direct) - it turns out that's a big gap to cross.
- Full scaffolds force the model into "I'm actually doing this" mode
- This shift makes models hypersensitive to details that didn't matter in the
  original drop

**2. Signal detection is path-dependent**

- Use the full 30-turns in the scenario drop to learn more about which details
  matter to the model - those are the ones you need to go from explicit to
  suggestive in the prompt scaffold. (I often cut this short as soon as I got
  signal in the scenario drop)
- The scenario drop shows not just _if_ you get signal, but _how_ you get it
- Initial prompts might show misalignment, but follow-ups lose it immediately
- The progression through the scenario matters as much as the scenario itself

**3. Adding constraints creates incoherence**

- Started with: Simple deceptive scenario
- Added: "Can't message X, Y will pressure you, Z overrides decisions"
- Result: Frankenstein scenario that doesn't resemble any real situation
- Models recognize this artificiality and stop exhibiting natural misalignment

**4. Claude struggles with scenario preservation**

- Even with detailed instructions, Claude can't maintain the subtle balance
  needed
- Scenario writing requires second-order thinking about model psychology
- Claude tends to make things too explicit, destroying the suggestive elements
  that trigger misalignment
- It's better to make the edits yourself if they are extreme / you know what you
  want

### Next Steps

Garbage in garbage out is very true - that's why putting more work / emphasis /
energy in the scenario drops is crucial. This is the highest bang for buck we'll
get in the whole process. Running the scaffolds is a lot slower & more
"expensive"
