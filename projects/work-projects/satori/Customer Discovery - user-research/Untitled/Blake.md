On TG

  

but how does it track

like we're supposed to have all our convos in the app?

and then what happens with 1:1 video chats

Yeah I think for the mvp he just wanted to make it easy to add to a cofounder chat & if that works well he would expand to video etc  

but you‚Äôre saying you barely chat and would be more useful to have it on calls?

we chat on tg & discord often  

but more day to day tasks

big picture discussions and convos happen on video

hard to have important convos on text

That makes a ton of sense  

when the product is ready would this be something you‚Äôd like to try?

or you‚Äôre like looks cool - but more gimmicy than really useful

i mean cofounder conflict is real  

im dealing with it right now low key lol

would be interesting

but also very hard to figure out how to integrate naturally

ok awesome feedback - thanks brother - when you click ‚Äúget coached‚Äù you should be able to sign up for the waitlist so that way he knows to contact you if you‚Äôre interested (obv no pressure - I‚Äôll relay the feedback you gave already!)  

also, I feel your pain üò¨

also this is so clean
