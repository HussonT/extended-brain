Could you please share any experiences where founders decided to see a couple's therapist regularly to prevent/fix these issues? (hopefully, prevent)

**[Lazy cofounder](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1g50ikv/lazy_cofounder/)**

Hey everyone. I’m starting out building a business with my best friend. The company is divided 50-50. The problem I’m having now is he is being lazy. He procrastinates almost all tasks, we are supposed to outreach a set number of potential clients a day and he doesn’t do them half of the time and lies to me about it. My father recommended we start tracking the tasks of the week on a excel. All my tasks are going down while his have been piling up from previous weeks. He is responsible for the finances also and it hasn’t been updated since early September. Every time I bring the topic up he gets aggressive, insults me, says I’m a horrible person and friend. I truly don’t know what else to do. I want to keep building this with him specially since the business has already grown. But I don’t know what the next step is.

What’s the difference between mentoring & coaching?

How can startup coaches, who have experienced the startup journey firsthand, better support their clients in taking bold, innovative steps rather than creating slow-moving businesses? What strategies can be employed to differentiate startup coaching from general business coaching and encourage more daring approaches in startups?
