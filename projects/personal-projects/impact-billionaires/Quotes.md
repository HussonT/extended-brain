There is no way to peace, peace is the way

"Most lucky events in life are opportunities, not outcomes.

The value of an opportunity changes depending on how it is treated. Without effort, good luck becomes a missed opportunity. With effort, good luck can become a life-changing event.

You need luck and hard work. It's not either/or. It's both/and. The result will not walk through the door on its own.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬"

When in doubt, just say thank you. There is no downside. Are you honestly worried about showing too much gratitude to the people in your life?

"How much could I lose?" is not merely a financial question.

If I make this choice:

- How much time could I lose?
- How much sanity could I lose?
- How much reputation could I lose?
- How much happiness could I lose?

Opportunity cost is about a lot more than money."
