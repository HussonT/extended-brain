**A 3 year vision of the Why & What for TIB**

**Intro**

What grew out of this personal question of why we aren’t solving bigger problems, led to an idea. What if we tried to make it easy and desirable for everyone to have & aspire to have massive impact? What if instead of chasing money or fame, we chased impacting each others lives for the better. Would we still have Hunger? War? Climate Disasters? To me, it seemed at least worth investigating if & how we could achieve a system in which all of us aspired to become impact billionaires. A system that is not just based on fluffy aspirations & moral high ground talk, but an actual upgrade of our socio-economic system to align incentives with impact for good.

In other words, what if all of us had incentive to really start asking the question: “with my interests & talents, what would it take to impact a billion people’s lives positively?” That to me, is the dream. That’s what I call a purpose economy and that is what The Impact Billionaires aims to enable, globally. And you’re about to dive in to what this project will look like three years from now.

**What is a vivid vision?**

A vivid vision is a max 3 page vivid description of what The Impact Billionaires will look, feel & act like in three years. A three year horizon is chosen as this is close enough to feel actionable yet far enough to make sure we’re aiming big & have a couple of attempts to build, measure, learn & adapt. Important therefore is to make the distinction that this documents only describes the why & what and speaks to none of the how. The how is what everyone that has anything to do with The Impact Billionaires’ story described in this document - the community, employees, friends, family, clients, coaches, partners, suppliers, government officials, competitors, …  - will help to figure out over the course of these next three years. With that, let’s dive in.

**Purpose - Our Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)**

Unleash purpose for massive impact

**Mission - Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG)**

Enable the purpose economy

**Values**

Massive Impact  - Driven to make a difference for others

Purpose - Empower the individual

Community  - Social capital as the main driver for impact

**Vision**

The overarching vision for the impact billionaires can be described as a moonshot factory for the people, by the people. It’s a place where anyone can put the word act in impact. It’s a place where it’s not the monetary billionaires decide what world problems we fix, but those willing to bring social, intellectual & labor capital to the table - which is something all of us can - shape projects that have the potential to change the world forever. This is not a place for innovators, but for disruptors. A place for those willing to  force revolutions. Who want to go from 0 to 1, instead of from 1 to 1000. A place for those who won’t take no for an answer when it comes to carrying out their vision.

This also makes it an ideal play-ground for people looking to find their higher purpose in life. In our quest for massive impact, we aim to help set as many souls on fire as possible. By developing, exploring & discussing visions worth bringing into existence, we’ve created a catalogue of possible futures that inspire & engage individuals to come together & build for that future - finding meaning in enabling that future.
