What is the doughnut economy story?

  
The current narrative  

  
THE MARKET, which is efficient—so give it free rein.  
Adam Smith famously wrote, ‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.’ The idea is that when the market’s invisible hand is set free to work its magic of allocative efficiency, it harnesses the self-interest of households and business to provide all the goods and jobs that are wanted.  
BUSINESS, which is innovative—so let it lead.  
‘The business of business is business’, summed up Milton Friedman’s influential philosophy in the 1970s. Firms bring together labour and capital to produce novel goods and services and to maximise their profits. There is no need to look at what goes on in their factories and farms, so long as they play within the legal rules of the game.  
FINANCE, which is infallible—so trust in its ways.  
Banks take people’s savings and dutifully turn them into profitable investments. Furthermore, according to Eugene Fama’s “influential ‘efficient-market hypothesis’ of 1970, the price of financial assets always fully reflects all relevant information. Hence, financial markets are ever adjusting but always ‘right’—and their smooth operation should not be distorted by regulation.  
TRADE, which is win-win—so open your borders.  
David Ricardo’s nineteenth-century theory of comparative advantage demonstrates that countries should focus on what they are relatively good at doing and then trade: both parties will gain from it, no matter how unequal they are.10 Hence trade barriers should be dismantled because they only distort the efficient workings of the international market.  
THE STATE, which is incompetent—so don’t let it meddle.  
When government tries to intervene in the market, it usually makes things worse, distorting incentives and picking white elephants instead of winners. If it tries to smooth the business cycle, Keynesian style, its timing will be off, and the market will pre-empt its effects.11 Beyond defending the nation’s borders and its citizens’ private property, it is quite simply best for the state to leave it to the market.  
Other characters not required on stage:  
“THE HOUSEHOLD, which is domestic—so leave it to the women.  
The household supplies labour and capital to the market, but there’s no need to lift the roof and ask what goes on within its four walls: wives and daughters kindly take care of domestic affairs and they belong in the home, as does this matter.  
“SOCIETY, which is non-existent—so ignore it.  
‘There is no such thing as society,’ Margaret Thatcher famously declared in the 1980s. ‘There are individual men and women, and there are families.’13 And it is the market that connects them, as workers and as consumers.  
THE COMMONS, which are tragic—so sell them off.  
In the 1960s, Garrett Hardin described ‘the tragedy of the commons’ in which shared resources—such as grazing land and fish stocks—tend to be over-exploited by individual users and so are depleted for all.12 Managing such resources sustainably therefore calls for government regulation or, better still, private ownership. SOCIETY, which is non-existent—so ignore it. ‘There is no such thing as society,’ Margaret Thatcher famously declared in the 1980s. ‘There are individual men and women, and there are families.’13 And it is the market that connects them, as workers and as consumers.  
EARTH, which is inexhaustible—so take all you want.  
There will be no shortage of Earth’s resources, claimed the laissez-faire economist Julian Simon in the 1980s, if markets are permitted to do their job. A shortage of, say, copper or oil will raise its price, spurring people to use it more sparingly, search for new sources and discover substitutes.14  
POWER, which is irrelevant—so don’t mention it.  
The only economic power to be worried about, argued Friedman, is monopoly power granted by the state when it meddles in the market, and the distortionary power of trade unions. The single best way to combat it is (no surprise) free markets and free trade.15  
It was, undeniably, a brilliant line-up—and almost a stitch-up. The market, promised the neoliberal script, is the road to freedom, and who could be against that? But putting blind faith in markets—while ignoring the living world, society and the runaway power of banks—has taken us to the brink of ecological, social and financial collapse. It is time for the neoliberal show to leave the stage: a very different story is emerging.”  
The updated narrative  
“EARTH, which is life giving—so respect its boundaries  
“Far from floating against a white background, the economy exists within the biosphere—that delicate living zone of Earth’s land, waters and atmosphere. And it continually draws in energy and matter from Earth’s materials and living systems, while expelling waste heat and matter back out into it. Everything that is produced—from clay bricks to Lego blocks, websites to construction sites, liver pâté to patio furniture, single cream to double glazing—depends upon this throughflow of energy and matter, from biomass and fossil fuels to metal ores and minerals.”  
Source  
“let’s restore sense from the outset and recognise that, far from being a closed, circular loop, the economy is an open system with constant inflows and outflows of matter and energy. The economy depends upon Earth as a source—extracting finite resources such as oil, clay, cobalt and copper, and harvesting renewable ones such as timber, crops, fish and fresh water. ”  
Sink  
“The economy likewise depends upon Earth as a sink for its wastes—such as greenhouse gas emissions, fertiliser run-off and throwaway plastics. Earth itself, however, is a closed system because almost no matter leaves or arrives on this planet: energy from the sun may flow through it, but materials can only cycle within it.22”  
SOCIETY, which is foundational—so nurture its connections  
“Community connectedness is not just about warm fuzzy tales of civic triumph,’ writes Putnam; ‘In measurable and well-documented ways . . . social capital makes us smarter, healthier, safer, richer and better able to govern a just and stable democracy.’26 It’s clear that an economy’s vibrancy depends upon the trust, norms and sense of reciprocity nurtured within society—just as every sport depends upon its players abiding by a shared set of rules. ”  
“Significant changes occur when social movements reach a critical point of power capable of moving cautious politicians beyond their tendency to keep things as they are,’ writes the American historian Howard Zinn, pointing to his own country’s nineteenth-century anti-slavery movement and twentieth-century civil rights movement.27 Democratic governance of society and the economy rests on the right and capacity of citizens to engage in public debate—hence the importance of ‘political voice’ within the Doughnut’s social foundation.”  
THE ECONOMY, which is diverse—so support all of its systems  
“Embedded within this rich web of society is the economy itself, the realm in which people produce, distribute and consume products and services that meet their wants and needs. One basic feature of the economy is rarely pointed out in Econ 101—it is typically made up of four realms of provisioning: the household, the market, the commons and the state, as shown in the Embedded Economy diagram.”“All four are means of production and distribution, but they go about it in very different ways. ”  
“Households produce ‘core’ goods for their own members; the market produces private goods for those willing and able to pay; the commons produce co-created goods for the communities involved; and the state produces public goods for all the populace.”  
“I wouldn’t want to live in a society whose economy lacked any of these four realms of provisioning because each one has distinct qualities and much of their value arises through their interactions. In other words, they work best when they work together.”  
THE HOUSEHOLD, which is core—so value its contribution  
“The Circular Flow diagram depicted labour appearing—hey presto!—fresh and ready for work each day at the office or factory door. So who cooked, cleaned up, and cleared away to make that possible? ”  
“When Adam Smith, extolling the power of the market, noted that ‘it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner’, he forgot to mention the benevolence of his mother, Margaret Douglas, who had raised her boy alone from birth. Smith never married, so had no wife to rely upon (nor children of his own to raise)”  
“However, as economist Neva Goodwin has pointed out, far from being secondary, it is actually the ‘core economy’, and it comes first every day, sustaining the essentials of family and social life with the universal human resources of time, knowledge, skill, care, empathy, teaching and reciprocity”  
“And since work in the core economy is unpaid, it is routinely undervalued and exploited, generating lifelong inequalities in social standing, job opportunities, income and power between women and men.  
By largely ignoring the core economy, mainstream economics has also overlooked just how much the paid economy depends upon it. Without all that cooking, washing, nursing and sweeping, there would be no workers—today or in the future—who were healthy, well-fed and ready for work each morning.”  
“As the futurist Alvin Toffler liked to ask at smart gatherings of business executives, ‘How productive would your workforce be if it hadn’t been toilet trained?”  
“if women were paid the going hourly rate for each of their roles—switching between housekeeper and daycare teacher to van driver and cleaner—then stay-at-home mums would earn around $120,000 each year. Even mothers who do head out to work each day would earn an extra $70,000 on top of their ”  
THE MARKET, which is powerful—so embed it wisely  
“Adam Smith’s great insight was to show that the marketplace can mobilise diffuse information about people’s wants and the cost of meeting them, thereby coordinating billions of buyers and sellers through a global system of prices—all without the need for a centralised grand plan.”  
“It was out of recognition of this power that the neoliberal scriptwriters put the market centre stage in their economic play. There is, however, a flip side to the market’s power: it only values what is priced and only delivers to those who can pay.”  
“Like fire, it is extremely efficient at what it does, but dangerous if it gets out of control. When the market is unconstrained, it degrades the living world by over-stressing Earth’s sources and sinks. It also fails to deliver essential public goods—from education and vaccines to roads and railways—on which its own success deeply depends. ”  
“A market looks free only because we so unconditionally accept its underlying restrictions that we fail to see them.”  
“Forget the free market: think embedded market. And, strange though it sounds, that means there is no such thing as deregulation, only reregulation that embeds the market in a different set of political, legal and cultural rules, simply shifting who bears the risks and costs and who reaps the gains of change”  
THE COMMONS, which are creative—so unleash their potential  
“The commons are shareable resources of nature or society that people choose to use and govern through self-organising, instead of relying on the state or market for doing so. Think of how a village community might manage its only freshwater well and its nearby forest, or how Internet users worldwide collaboratively curate Wikipedia.”  
“Garrett Hardin’s description of the commons as ‘tragic’—which fitted so neatly into the neoliberal script—arose from his belief that, if left as open “access to all, then pastures, forests and fishing grounds would inevitably be overused and depleted. He was most probably right about that, but ‘open access’ is far from how successful commons are actually governed.  
“In the 1970s, the little-known political scientist Elinor Ostrom started seeking out real-life examples of well-managed natural commons to find out what made them work—and she went on to win a Nobel-Memorial prize for what she discovered. Rather than being left as ‘open access’, those successful commons were governed by clearly defined communities with collectively agreed rules and punitive sanctions for those who broke them.38 Far from tragic, she realised, the commons can turn out to be a triumph, outperforming both state and market in sustainably stewarding and equitably harvesting Earth’s resources, as Chapters 5 and 6 illustrate.”  
“The triumph of the commons is certainly evident in the digital commons, which are fast turning into one of the most dynamic arenas of the global economy. It is a transformation made possible, argues the economic analyst Jeremy Rifkin, by the ongoing convergence of networks for digital communications, renewable energy and 3D printing, creating what he has called ‘the collaborative commons”  
“What makes the convergence of these technologies so powerfully disruptive is their potential for distributed ownership, networked collaboration and minimal running costs. Once the solar panels, computer networks and 3D printers are in place, the cost of producing one extra joule of energy, one extra download, one extra 3D printed component, is close to nothing, leading Rifkin to dub it ‘the zero-marginal-cost revolution’.”  
“The result is that a growing range of products and services can be produced abundantly, nearly for free, unleashing potential such as open-source design, free online education and distributed manufacturing. In some key sectors, the twenty-first-century collaborative commons has started to complement, compete with, and even displace the market. What’s more, the value generated is enjoyed directly by those who co-create in the commons, and it may never be monetised—with intriguing implications for the future of GDP growth, as Chapter 7 explores.”  
THE STATE, which is essential—so make it accountable  
“As lead author of the neoliberal script, Milton Friedman was determined to limit the state’s economic role to defending the nation, policing its streets and enforcing its laws. Its legitimate purpose, he believed, was simply to secure private property and legal contracts, which he saw as the prerequisites for smoothly functioning markets”  
“In effect, he sought to relegate the state to a non-speaking part in the economic play: mentioned in the storyline, seen fleetingly on stage, but permitted little action. His rival, Paul Samuelson, strongly disagreed with that view. ‘The creative role of government in economic life is vast and inescapable in an interdependent and crowded world,’ he wrote in later editions of his textbook, but Friedman’s stance still prevailed among those keen to ‘roll back’ the state.41  
For the twenty-first-century economic story, the state’s role must be rethought. Put it this way: in the film of the play, the state should be aiming all-out to win Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars—starring as the economic partner that supports the household, the commons and the market alike. ”  
FINANCE, which is in service—so make it serve society  
“Three long-held myths make up the traditional story of finance: that commercial banks work by turning people’s savings into investments; that financial trading smoothes out the economy’s fluctuations; and that, therefore, the financial sector provides a valuable service to the productive economy.”  
“All three of these myths were busted very publicly by the 2008 financial crisis. Far from simply lending out savings, banks magically create money as credit. Far from promoting stability, financial markets inherently generate flux. And far from providing a valuable service to the productive economy, finance has turned into the tail that wags the dog.”  
“First, contrary to the textbook story and the Circular Flow diagram, banks do not merely lend out the money that has been deposited by their savers. They create money from nothing each time they issue loans—recording on their books both a liability (since the loan is withdrawn by the borrower) and a credit (since the loan will be repaid with interest over time)”  
“Second, financial markets do not tend to promote economic stability, despite the claims that they do. Thanks to financial deregulation, said US Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan in 2004, ‘not only have individual financial institutions become less vulnerable to shocks from underlying risk factors, but also the financial system as a whole has become more resilient.’45 Four years later, the financial crash disproved that claim in a fairly decisive way. ”  
“Lastly, far from playing a supporting role to the productive economy, finance has come to dominate it. In many countries, a small financial elite—based in just a handful of banking and financial firms—controls the public good of money creation and profits handsomely from it, while too often desta“bilising much of the wider economy in the process. ”  
BUSINESS, which is innovative—so give it purpose  
“Operating within the realm of the market, business can be extraordinarily effective in combining people, technology, energy, materials and finance to create something new.”  
“The neoliberal narrative claimed that the market mechanism is what makes firms efficient, and so ignored what goes on inside them, just as it did with the household. But it is essential to lift the lid here too and look inside the black box of production.”  
“Power is always at play between a firm’s waged workers and its shareholding owners because of the vast inequalities between them, as Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx witnessed in the squalid factories of Victorian Britain.”  
“Ensuring workers’ rights to organise and bargain collectively is one way of offsetting such deep power imbalances; another is to change the ownership structure of the firm itself, ending the centuries-old divide between workers and owners, as Chapter 5 explores. ”  
“firms need a purpose far more inspiring than merely maximising shareholder value, and as Chapter 6 illustrates, a growing number of enterprises are finding ways to give themselves one.”  
TRADE, which is double-edged—so make it fair  
“Ricardo’s influential theory of win–win trade was based on products such as wine and cloth, and assumed that the factors of production—land, labour and capital—were immovable behind national borders. Today, everything but land moves, with cross-border flows including trade in products and services (from fresh fruit to legal advice); foreign direct investment (in businesses and properties); financial flows (from bank loans to corporate stocks); and the migration of people in search of a livelihood.”  
“All of these cross-border flows have the potential to deliver benefits but they carry risks too. When it is cheaper to import staple foods such as rice and wheat than it is to grow them, trade can significantly reduce food prices for consumers. At the same time, it may undermine domestic food production and leave the country highly vulnerable to international price hikes—as bread riots from Egypt to Burkina Faso revealed when the global price of wheat, corn and rice trebled during the food price crisis of 2007–8.”  
“When skilled workers migrate—such as doctors and nurses from sub-Saharan Africa working in Europe—they bring valuable skills and send much-needed remittances to their families back home, but this can also lead to a skill shortage in their own country’s core services.”  
“When corporations offshore manufacturing, it often delivers cheaper products to consumers and creates new jobs overseas. But it can also result in domestic job losses that decimate whole communities—as experienced in America’s ‘rust belt’, the nation’s former industrial heartland.”  
“POWER, which is pervasive—so check its abuse”  
“Search for the word ‘power’ in the index of a modern economics textbook and—if mentioned at all—it will probably refer you to an analysis of electricity sector reform. But power is at play in myriad places throughout the economy and society: in daily household decisions about who cares for the kids; in boss-versus-worker wage negotiations; in international trade and climate-change talks; and in humanity’s domination over other species on the planet. Wherever people are present, so too are power relations: think of them as running throughout the Embedded Economy diagram, within each of its domains and at the interface between them too.”  
“Out of all of these power relationships, when it comes to the workings of the economy, one in particular demands attention: the power of the wealthy to reshape the economy’s rules in their favour. ”  
“Samuelson’s Circular Flow diagram inadvertently helped to gloss over this matter by depicting households as a homogeneous group, each one offering its labour and capital in return for wages and a share of profits—which are, in turn, paid out by a cluster of homogeneous firms.”  
“Inequality amongst households and firms alike has soared in many countries in recent decades. And the extreme concentration of income and wealth—in the hands both of billionaires and of corporate boards—rapidly turns into power over how and for whom the economy is run.”

“It ends the myth of the self-contained, self-sustaining market, replacing it with provisioning by the household, market, commons and state—all embedded within and dependent upon society, which in turn is embedded within the living world. It shifts our attention from merely tracking the flow of income to understanding the many distinct sources of wealth—natural, social, human, physical and financial—on which our well-being depends.”  
“This new vision prompts new questions. Instead of immediately focusing on making markets work more efficiently, we can start by considering: when is each of the four realms of provisioning—household, commons, market and state—best suited to delivering humanity’s diverse wants and needs? ”  
“What changes in technology, culture and social norms might alter that? How can these four realms most effectively work together—such as the market with the commons, the commons with the state, or the state with the household? Likewise, rather than focusing by default on how to increase economic activity, ask how the content and structure of that activity might be shaping society, politics and power. And just how big can the economy become, given Earth’s ecological capacity?”
