### Short Bio

John's been obsessed with impact since the day he learned about all of the global challenges. Big questions, ideas & impact are what he's constantly after - discussing, thinking, philosophising about what it takes to have impact. Both on a conceptual level as well as on a very concrete level. He founded his company with a clear view on charting his own course towards having that impact.

He's part of multiple online communities as he doesn't really feel at home with the people around him. He's often lonely in his quest for impact as very often people mistake his big ambitions for pure naïveté. However he knows it will take time & that his vibe attracts his tribe. It's in one of those online communities that he stumbled across this podcast that seems to align perfectly with his goals and ambitions. He listens to hear the stories of those who are on similar journeys as him & to get strategies and tactics that can help him achieve more impact, faster. It makes him feel inspire, connected & understood.

### Bio

Helena is restlessly seeking for that thing that could unlock her idea of what her life's all about. She knows it goes beyond just making money and she knows she wants it to be meaningful for society. She's able to surround herself with people that inspire her and she makes good moves when it comes to her career. However, because she doesn't fully know what makes her tick yet - she sometimes feels a little lost in what she's doing as work.

She constantly has this feeling of being on the lookout for exactly that thing that's going to put her soul on fire. She listens to multiple podcasts ranging from entrepreneurship, to self help & from time to time there's a history podcast in there too. One day, she's going to start or join a startup or NGO that promises to change this world for the better.

But for now, she's learning the ropes at a big corporate - and while she wants to have an impact from that perspective too - the corporate machine sometimes holds her back too much to be able to feel like she's fully living her life's purpose. Pauline has many friends that she truly connects with and many of them are people with a broad mindset & a same willingness to have impact. The topics she discusses with her friends range from those more serious topics all the way to funny anecdotes.

She listens to it on her commute to work as it fires her up to look for impact opportunities there & gets her day dreaming about what challenges she might want to tackle throughout her life.

### Short Bio

Pia's been driven to make a difference since she can remember. She's had this be part of her family values from when she was a kid, so it was no surprise when she turned down all the corporate offers she got when she graduated and chose an impact first business.

She loves connecting with individuals who have clear views on how they could improve the world, although she sometimes lacks the ideas, she thinks. Not the drive though. She knows one day she wants to be on the founding team of a succesful impact business - but for now she's very happy where she's at.
