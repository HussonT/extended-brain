# Pre-mortem Analysis Checklist

*"Invert, always invert" - Carl Jacobi (via Charlie Munger)*

A systematic approach to imagining failure before it happens, allowing you to prevent problems rather than solve them.

## Pre-Decision Analysis

### Define the Decision/Project
- [ ] What exactly are we deciding or planning to do?
- [ ] What does success look like? (Specific, measurable outcomes)
- [ ] What's the timeline for this decision/project?
- [ ] Who are the key stakeholders affected?
- [ ] What resources are we committing?

### The Pre-mortem Exercise
- [ ] Fast forward to [timeline] - the project/decision has failed spectacularly
- [ ] Write the failure story in detail - what went wrong?
- [ ] List all the ways this could fail (aim for at least 10)
- [ ] For each failure mode, rate probability (1-5) and impact (1-5)
- [ ] Identify which failures would be catastrophic vs recoverable

## Failure Categories to Consider

### Human Factors
- [ ] Key person leaves or becomes unavailable
- [ ] Team conflict or communication breakdown
- [ ] Skill gaps or competency issues
- [ ] Motivation/commitment problems
- [ ] Decision-making bottlenecks

### External Factors
- [ ] Market conditions change
- [ ] Competitor actions
- [ ] Regulatory/legal changes
- [ ] Technology shifts
- [ ] Economic downturns
- [ ] Force majeure events

### Internal Factors
- [ ] Resource constraints (time, money, people)
- [ ] Technical/operational failures
- [ ] Process breakdowns
- [ ] Quality issues
- [ ] Scope creep

### Assumption Failures
- [ ] List all key assumptions being made
- [ ] What if each assumption is wrong?
- [ ] Which assumptions are we most uncertain about?
- [ ] How can we test assumptions before committing?

## Prevention Planning

### For Each Major Risk Identified
- [ ] Can we prevent this? How?
- [ ] Can we detect early warning signs?
- [ ] What would be our response if it happens?
- [ ] Should we create contingency plans?
- [ ] Does this risk change our decision?

### Mitigation Strategies
- [ ] Add buffers (time, resources, redundancy)
- [ ] Create checkpoints and kill switches
- [ ] Diversify dependencies
- [ ] Build in flexibility/optionality
- [ ] Transfer or share risks

## Decision Point

### Final Assessment
- [ ] Given all identified risks, should we proceed?
- [ ] Have we addressed the catastrophic failure modes?
- [ ] Are the remaining risks acceptable?
- [ ] Do we have adequate mitigation plans?
- [ ] Would we be okay if the worst-case scenario happened?

### If Proceeding
- [ ] Document all identified risks and mitigation plans
- [ ] Set up early warning systems
- [ ] Schedule regular risk reviews
- [ ] Assign risk owners
- [ ] Communicate risks to all stakeholders

## Post-Implementation

### Regular Reviews
- [ ] Which risks materialized?
- [ ] Which risks did we miss?
- [ ] How effective were our mitigation strategies?
- [ ] What would we do differently?
- [ ] Update risk register for future decisions

*Remember: The goal isn't to be pessimistic, but to be thoroughly prepared. A good pre-mortem makes success more likely by addressing problems before they occur.*
