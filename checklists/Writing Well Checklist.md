# Writing Well Checklist

> [!important] Sources: "Bird by Bird" by Anne Lamott & "The Sense of Style" by Steven Pinker

## Pre-Writing: Setting Yourself Up for Success

### 🎯 The One-Inch Picture Frame (Lamott)
- [ ] **Am I focused on just one small, specific scene or moment?** Don't try to write about your entire childhood—write about the first day of third grade. Don't describe the whole beach—describe the feel of sand between your toes.
- [ ] **Have I narrowed my scope enough to actually start?** If you're overwhelmed, zoom in further. Can you describe just what you see through a one-inch picture frame?

### 🧠 Overcoming the Curse of Knowledge (Pinker)
- [ ] **Have I identified all the jargon, acronyms, and insider knowledge I'm assuming?** List every term or concept that might be unfamiliar to someone outside your field.
- [ ] **Did I explain context before diving into details?** Your reader doesn't live in your head—they need the backstory, the setup, the "why this matters" before the "what happened."
- [ ] **Have I tested my writing on someone unfamiliar with the topic?** If you can't find a test reader, wait 48 hours and read it yourself with fresh eyes.

## During Writing: Craft & Flow

### 📻 Silencing Radio Station KFKD (Lamott)
- [ ] **Am I letting perfectionism stop me from getting words on the page?** Remember: you're aiming for a "shitty first draft," not a masterpiece.
- [ ] **Have I acknowledged but not indulged the voices of self-doubt and self-aggrandizement?** Notice them, name them ("there's my imposter syndrome"), then keep writing.
- [ ] **Am I writing through the noise instead of waiting for silence?** The voices never fully stop—write anyway.

### 🎭 Classic Style: Show, Don't Lecture (Pinker)
- [ ] **Am I writing as if I'm showing the reader something through a window?** Not lecturing from a podium, but standing beside them pointing out what you see.
- [ ] **Have I used concrete visual language instead of abstract concepts?** Instead of "utilize," write "use." Instead of "the assessment revealed deficiencies," write "the test showed problems."
- [ ] **Do I sound like I'm having a conversation with an intelligent friend?** Drop the academic hedging ("it might be argued that perhaps") and speak directly.

### 🌱 The Emotional Acre (Lamott)
- [ ] **Have I included specific, sensory details that reveal character?** What's in their pocket? How do they eat their eggs? What song gets stuck in their head?
- [ ] **Am I telling the emotional truth, even in fiction?** The facts can be invented, but the feelings must be real.
- [ ] **Have I explored the full "emotional acre" of my subject?** Don't just show what they do—show what they fear, love, remember, and regret.

## Post-Writing: Revision & Polish

### 🔍 Zombie Noun Hunt (Pinker)
- [ ] **Have I eliminated unnecessary nominalizations?** Change "make a decision" to "decide," "conduct an investigation" to "investigate."
- [ ] **Are my subjects doing things (active voice) rather than having things done to them?** "The dog bit the man" is clearer than "The man was bitten by the dog."
- [ ] **Have I cut the apologetic hedging that weakens my prose?** Remove "somewhat," "rather," "quite," "in a sense" unless they add genuine meaning.

### 🐦 Bird by Bird Coherence (Lamott)
- [ ] **Does each paragraph build naturally from the previous one?** Like laying stones for a path—each one should connect to the last.
- [ ] **Have I maintained consistent tone and vocabulary throughout?** Don't switch from casual to formal mid-essay without good reason.
- [ ] **Is there a clear through-line from beginning to end?** Can you trace the journey in a single sentence?

### 👥 The Reader's Vantage Point (Pinker)
- [ ] **Have I oriented the reader before asking them to follow complex ideas?** Give them the map before the journey.
- [ ] **Did I introduce characters and concepts before referencing them?** Never make the reader flip back to figure out who "Johnson" is.
- [ ] **Have I used "I" and "you" to create connection?** Unless formality demands otherwise, personal pronouns create warmth.

## Final Checks: The Non-Obvious Excellence Markers

### ✨ The Five Non-Obvious Excellence Checks

1. [ ] **The Callback Test**: Does your ending echo or transform something from your beginning? Great writing often comes full circle with new understanding.

2. [ ] **The Deletion Audit**: Can you cut your first paragraph (or even first page) and make the piece stronger? Often our "throat-clearing" paragraphs are just us warming up.

3. [ ] **The Rhythm Check**: Read it aloud—does it have music? Vary sentence lengths. Short punches. Longer sentences that meander like rivers through the landscape of your ideas, carrying the reader along on their current.

4. [ ] **The Surprise Quota**: Have you included at least one unexpected comparison, insight, or turn of phrase per page? Predictable writing is forgettable writing.

5. [ ] **The Vulnerability Moment**: Have you revealed something genuine—a doubt, a mistake, a change of mind? Perfection is suspicious; humanity connects.

## Remember

> "Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life." —Anne Lamott

> "The curse of knowledge is the single best explanation I know of why good people write bad prose." —Steven Pinker

**The goal isn't perfect writing—it's clear, honest, engaging communication that respects both the reader's intelligence and their time.**

*Last insight: If you're stuck, write the worst possible version of what you're trying to say. Make it terrible on purpose. Often, this breaks the dam and shows you what you actually want to write.*
