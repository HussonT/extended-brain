# Insights, Design Principles, and Ideas

## Insights

(Link to any relevant research nuggets)

- (Example) Recruiters often struggle to keep the information they need about a candidate available while they're navigating the platform. Often they'll need to open many tabs or frequently jump back and forth between pages to reference key pieces of information about the candidate they're looking at.

- Insight 3

## Design Principles

- (Example) Keep the relevant information about a candidate easily visible or accessible in any part of the interface where the recruiter must make a choice
- Principle 2
- Principle 3

## Product Ideas

- (Example) Design a reusable component that shows the user's name, contact, location, last work experience, education, and desired salary. Make sure it can be used everywhere in the interface that this information is needed, so that the client/agency users can easily recognize and find the information they're looking for.
