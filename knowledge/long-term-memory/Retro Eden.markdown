## 2022  
  
### Q2  
  
* Starting the journey with EF  
	* Expectations  
		* My expectations were that I was going to find an extraordinary co-founder who was going to build a world changing company with me.  
		* That finding people with a huge amount of ambition and PhD in their title would be enough to build something truly meaningful.  
		* I was also expecting that technology was going to be the key unlock.  
	* Reality  
		* Dogmatically focussed  
			* I was very dogmatic & "too focussed" on one thing - did not leave room for exploration: I was lasered in on one co-founder, one space (web3), one problem (talent engagement) and while that is good initially - I realise how important this idea of strong beliefs, weakly held is.  
		* not sensitive to the right signal  
			* and how to actually fulfil this - as in the best way to be that is to be senstive to signal and to pain, not in way to let it stop you - but in a way to feel the pain and let that inform decisions. For signal to be relevant though, you need to know what your criteria are and I didn't have those clear enough. For startups its now really clear that the only criteria that matters initially is: what do people want & are you giving it to them?  
		* not knowing what the right singals were  
			* both on the co-founder front as well as on the business front I wasn’t entirely sure what I needed to look for  
				* reality was that I’d barely sold any projects with Humain - only learned to execute and build a brand  
				* And only had one great partner and that was emily where I realised too late that that is exactly what I need  
				* That meant I was impressed by the wrong skills needed for early stage success  
		* Massive imposter syndrome (very little self-confidence)  
			* I was very very dependant on approval of people I see as “superior” to me which made it hard to think independently - I often caught myself thinking - what would X want me to do?  
		* Trying to outsmart the system  
			* Integrity matters - don’t do business with pepole that don’t seem to have a very clear moral code - run as soon as you smell  
	* Learnings  
		* …  
* Ignoring collab inuititon due to personal faulty relationship with anger  
	* Expectations  
		* Locking in was the only thing that mattered  
		* We did “all the right things”  
			* move in together  
			* go to the conferences on a whim bc that’s where our “customers” were  
			* work 14h/day  
			* not spend any time doing other things  
		* Focus on making the relationships work  
		* Be impressed by the other founder - “feel lucky to be working with them”  
	* Reality  
		* “playing founder” - not really listening to the advice  
			* The only thing that truly matters in the beginning is talking to customers & shipping code to build something people want  - building team, playing politics all those thigns dont matter  
		* The importance of personal relationship, respect & admiration for the right things was overlooked  
			* I was impressed by his ability to manage a team - that is not at all what we needed at that stage  
		* The importance of deep self knowledge & emotional regulation  
			* the fact that I’d completley yielded all control to him because I lost my temper & had a weird relationship with anger is what ended up costing me very very dearly  
		* Played bullshit, ego driven, timewasting, trust breaking power games in the beginning  
			* …  
	* Learnings  
		* Find very smart people that you’re excited to disagree with without feeling like it’s a politics or a power game  
  
### Q3  
  
* Building with Developer DAO & Bankless DAO  
	* Expectations  
		* 1 week evaluation trial of the clients  
		* We’ll get clear signal and decide accordingly  
		* Get data & act upon it  
	* Reality  
		* no time limit  
			* evaluation kept dragging on and we ended up solutioning for potential problems instead of rooting them in real ones  
		* unclear about what we wanted to  learn  
			* didn’t evaluate after a week because it was unclear what pass/fail would look like  
		* created a ton of moment for the wrong reasons  
			* we could have caught by thinking for 5 minutes that communities are not a great client to build for because  
				* many opinions  
				* want lots of stuff  
				* nobody wants to pay for it  
	* Learnings  
		* …  
* Iterating on the wrong things in the wrong way  
	* Expectations  
		* Avoid the build trap at all costs  
		* Let the market pull the product out of you  
		* Iterate very fast with users  
	* Reality  
		* started building with a team of almost 30 people  
		* created a ton of building momentum without any validated business ideas  
		* did not do any serious testing  
			* no “real” buy in - nobody actually wanted to invest time or money in what we were building.  
	* Learnings  
  
### Q4  
  
* Kicking off the raise & building up conviction on a faulty foundation  
	* Expectations  
		* brute force this bitch - it’s a numbers game  
		* keep going no matter what  
		* sell the dream & the vision  
		* CEO’s job  
	* Reality  
		* completely detached from product & actual progress to be able to sell it  
			* was basically selling a vision/air > should have taken how far we were from actually making something happen as a huge signal  
		* cut myself off from the pain of rejection to keep going  
			* numbers game approach created a numbness to pain while you need a tolerance and ability to adjust  
	* Learnings  
		* The best way to attract funding is to actually be a great investement  
		* A great founder has a high tolerance for pain without losing the sensitivity to pain - high tolerance for pain through numbness doesn’t count  
* Obsession with the longterm vision over the short term needed change  
	* Expectations  
		* Iterate quickly to build a massive business  
		* vision visions vision = motivation motivation motivation  
	* Reality  
		* Focussed way to much on the strategic meaning of it all  
		* Did not iterate fast enough on the today problem - always stayed in the tomorrow problem  
		* Need to detach from the day to day during the raise made me overobsess with the future witout finding the bridge from today to tomorrow  
	* Learnings  
		* Make a distinction between generals & soldiers mode - you should be in soliders mode about 95% of the time  
		* next week >>> next 10 years  
  
## 2023  
  
### Q1  
  
* Pushing through the raise  
	* Expectations  
		* re: importance of pain tolerance versus pain numbness  
		* we can close the 500K round we don’t need to push further - we’ll get it  
		* A higher valuation will be a lot better  
	* Reality  
		* It’s very hard to get good feedback from VCs  
		* The high valuation in the beginning without much backing to it made us look like we didnt know what we  were doing - bc we didn’t know what we were doing  
	* Learnings  
		* How you process pain as a founder is super important - bc it contains tons of signal  
		* If you have momentum with your raise, keep pushing - more money is almost always better  
* Not focussed,  chaising tails  
	* Expectations  
		* “Let’s keep pushing” - we’re almost there  
		* “one day late”  
		* silver bullet features  
			* Oh if we build this then we’re golden  
		* “but the user/customer asked for this”  
	* Reality  
		* things that were initially going to be tested in 2 days ended up taking 2 months because we were incrementally innovating on faster horses for customers that weren’t going to pay off to begin with.  
	* Learnings  
		* Push vs pull momentum  
			* self propelled push momentum is the most expensive type of momentum - find pull momentum as fast as you can OR make sure that the push momentum has a high likelihood of turning into pull momentum  
		* Run up & down the hills in the through of sorrow as fast as you can  
			* it’s important to go from skateboard to bike, not from skateboard to skateboard with blinking wheels - that requires having to courage to scrap the solution you have fully every time and fast enough - incremental improvements rarely gives the unlock from no signal to massive signal  
* Holding on frantically on making D_D work  
	* Expectations  
		* D_D was going to be a huge hiring unlock - a  pool of 5K devs ripe for the plucking  
		* The assumption was that the main problem was discoverability & reachability  
			* how can you know who can do what in a discord of 5K people?  
		* The assumption was also that once we cracked supply, demand would follow since the demand side was the hardest to convince  
		* We had what felt like the top leadership & the most relevant people in D_D that continously said they would open doors when they didn’t  
	* Reality  
		* We worked for way too long getting a simple job-board to work on faulty information  
			* Manny said he was making $15K from Pallet - which can’t possible be right bc if they were this would be their only means of income  
			* A job board is faster horses - it’s highly unlikely that an innovation in the way we use job-boards is dramatically going to change the way we do things.  
		* We didn’t realise that D_D wasn’t the right partner because we’d built up so much momentum towards serving them  
		* …  
	* Learnings  
		* talk is cheap  
			* Beware sales guys who promise you the world but don’t put their money where their mout is  
		* “You’re only allowed 2 mircales per startup”  
		* play stupid games, win stupid prizes  
			* Not sure why we were so excited with a worthless D_D code grant  
		* Trust but verify  
			* if there’s a very important assumption that is a big unlock for your business, test it in as many fast cheap ways as possible  
				* cheapest way is to think through it and ask about it  
					* for example  
						* if they say they’re making $15K a month from a competitor, but have stopped using them, are they really making $15K a month? -> why would you cut off using $15K a month  
		* Don’t commit to a customer type before you’ve figured out if they’re a good one  
			* Definition of a great customer  
				* Answer the following questions to figure out if they are somebody you want to make something they would want for.  
					* Can they make meaningful decisions?  
						* Speed of decisions matters a lot for quick, relevant feedback  
							* The spectrum is  
								* Communities have very dispersed decision power  
								* CEO’s have all the decision power  
					* Do they have money/value to share?  
						* You want customers that have moneny & will gladly pay to get their problems solved  
					* Are they responsive/are you a prio?  
						* If it takes weeks for them to get back to you, this is not a hair on fire problem for them.  
					* Are they inspiring/fun to talk to for you?  
						* The problem with most of D_D people is that I didn’t vibe with them and that I didn’t like buildign for them - I thought most of them were losers  
  
### Q2  
  
* Not iterating fast enough  
	* Expectations  
		* ship new things every week - get in front of users & get feedback to iterate with  
	* Reality  
		* we were getting feedback, but we were iterating towards local maxima with all the might we have  
			* Building a branded job-board is not the huge unlock it needs to be  
		* OR we were solving problems we didnt have at all yet (the KG search for example)  
			* If you have 20 users - there are other ways to test search (keywords is probl it)  
	* Learnings  
		* Dogmatic about the vision, pragmatic about the approach to get there  
			* The fact that I was so against keywords search in my pitch, made us go the long way around to test some simple things in the beginning  
		* Build the right things before building things right  
			* The key objective of iterating is pmf = something people want  
				* the variables are  
					* people  
						* who are you building for and are they the right person to build for (see earlier)  
					* want  
						* what are the signals that people want this  
							* existing behaviours  
								* what’s the true friction point? What are they trying to work around all the time  
							* existing solutions  
								* what’s meaningfully better about the thing that you built?  
					* something  
						* what are you building & how is it helping you learn more about the people & what they (truly) want  
		* Beware the unframed hussle  
			* The unframed hussle is hussling for hussleing’s sake  
				* Momentum in the right direciton is important  
					* do  
						* first figure out if it’s the right direciton by seeing if momentum comes relatively easy  
						* the work to amplify momentum in that direction  
					* don’t  
						* don’t amplify momentum by hussling the wrong client type or by charming people to say yes for your sake rather than for the problem’s sake  
							* caveat = to get design partners, this is great but that is part of the figuring out where momentum comes easy  
* Conferences filled with (anti)signal (??)  
	* Expectations  
		* go to conferences to talk to potential users/customers, find out about their problems  and dreams and aspirations  
		* find clients & build with/for them  
		* find investors  
	* Reality  
		* skewed relevance signal  
			* conferences were great for building relationships  
				* but this skewed the signal on how useful what we’re building is - because now they’re engaging with me because they like me, not because they have the problem I have  
					* conferences are great when you’ve actually got something to sell  
		* confrences are an inefficient way to pratice your pitch & get clarity  
			* there are higher signal ways you can do this by cultivating an audience/meetings online  
				* If they don’t want to talk your meeting, that’s huge singal - iterate on your messaging until they do  
					* this signal you miss when you’re at a conference  
						* which makes it  feel like progress but truly isn’t  
		* However great way to build deep relationships with people I would otherwise never find  
	* Learnings  
		* smart money matters  
			* we honestly should not have been able to raise - sure, it gave us an at bat, for which I am eternally grateful - but what I’ve learned from this now is that there are some basics that need to be fleshed out to be an investable business that go beyond vision & salesmanship  
				* There are different kinds of no’s from investors

### Q3  
  
* Distracted summer  
	* Expectations  
		* “come back form the raise”  
			* Go from 24/7 to get the raise done   
				  
				to get to 24/7 to build an amazing product  
  
			* Continue on the momentum being built by Miltos  
	* Reality  
		* Miltos had pushed the product in a direction that made little sense  
	* Learnings
