## OS2 Recap & Themes

- Communication is a different problem
- Hiring is key
- Metrics
    - If you don't have em, you're screwed ]
- Growing leaders from within if you can
- Key thing when establishing a culture
    - Not all A players will fit in a culture → Fit within a culture (for ex get everybody from top universities)

## OS3 Intro

When you're moving from tribe to village

- When you move past 150, people within the company don't all know eachother anymore

  

3 ways

- We naturally need to grow → we just want to solidify the company
- "we're gonna be really scaling" → We're gonna double, but we also know we're just gonna keep doubling → keep it flexible
- OMG, I have to more than double → is very hard

Fast? → what does the global competition look like? Can you scale faster?

For linkedin:

- Came to a point where we could easily articulate the value proposition and people could quickly get what that value was
- We wanted to get consumer & revenenue growth up

  

## OS3: The Core Business

You never need to be this clear when you have 25 people in the company → very different when 425

The mission becomes a key touch stone

What's our core business? Our main focus?

"The moats" → these are what we need to grow

Good generalist

- Very high analytical clock speed
- Learn very fast
- And knows very quickly when not on right track

  

Good specialist

- How do you reproduce what you've learned?

## OS3: Execution Plan

You con't do everything brilliantly, so what do you focus on?

You need graphs & dashboards to manage the company in OS3

![[Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_05.38.16.png]]

- Don't wait till it's all broken & then fix it → You need to anticipate
- The right CEO → are you it? Do you maybe need a COO?

Went out for series B

→ very sussinct pitch

  

OS3

- You have to solve talent thing
- have to solve capital
- have to solve communication
- have to have clarity on what you want to get done

What about hiring?

Two options

- IF you hire easy, you have to fire fast
- OR create a very deep hiring process

  

What about transition between different stages → Head of engineering in tribe is not same in as head of engineering in village → do you believe they can? → coach them then otherwise have the conversation early
