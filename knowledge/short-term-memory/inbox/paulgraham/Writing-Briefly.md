| ![Writing,  Briefly](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/writing-briefly-2.gif)<br>March 2005<br>_(In the process_<br>_of answering an email, I accidentally wrote a tiny essay about writing._<br>_I usually spend weeks on an essay. This one took  67 minutesâ€”23_<br>_of writing, and  44 of rewriting.)_<br>I think it's far more important to write well than most people<br>realize. Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them.<br>If you're bad at writing and don't like to do it, you'll miss out<br>on most of the ideas writing would have generated.<br>As for how to write well, here's the short version: <br>Write a bad version<br>1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut ~~out~~ everything<br>unnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a nose for<br>bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate writers<br>you like; if you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to<br>write about, then write down what you said; expect<br>80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it,<br>and 50% of those you start with to be wrong; be confident enough<br>to cut; have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which<br>bits are confusing or drag; don't (always) make detailed outlines;<br>mull ideas over for a few days before<br>writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you; start writing <br>when you think of the first <br>sentence; if a deadline<br>forces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence<br>first; write about stuff you like; don't try to sound impressive; don't hesitate to change the topic on the fly;<br>use footnotes to contain digressions; use anaphora to knit<br>sentences together; read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble<br>over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the<br>paragraphs you dread reading); try to tell the<br>reader something new and useful; work in fairly big quanta of time;<br>when you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you<br>finish, leave yourself something easy to start with; accumulate<br>notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don't<br>feel obliged to cover any of them; write for a reader who won't<br>read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are<br>designed to sound ok on crappy car radios; <br>if you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately;<br>ask friends which sentence you'll regret most; go back and tone<br>down harsh remarks; publish stuff online, because<br>an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more<br>ideas; print out drafts instead of just looking at them<br>on the screen; use simple, germanic words; learn to distinguish<br>surprises from digressions; learn to recognize the approach of an<br>ending, and when one appears, grab it. |
