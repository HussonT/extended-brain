| ![Inequality and Risk](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/inequality-and-risk-2.gif)<br>August 2005<br>_(This essay is derived from a talk at Defcon 2005.)_<br>Suppose you wanted to get rid of economic inequality. There are<br>two ways to do it: give money to the poor, or take it away from the <br>rich. But they amount to the same thing, because if you want to<br>give money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere. You<br>can't get it from the poor, or they just end up where they started.<br>You have to get it from the rich.<br>There is of course a way to make the poor richer without simply<br>shifting money from the rich. You could help the poor become more<br>productive — for example, by improving access to education. Instead<br>of taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks,<br>you could enable people who would have become checkout clerks to<br>become engineers.<br>This is an excellent strategy for making the poor richer. But the<br>evidence of the last 200 years shows that it doesn't reduce economic<br>inequality, because it makes the rich richer too. If there<br>are more engineers, then there are more opportunities to hire them<br>and to sell them things. Henry Ford couldn't have made a fortune <br>building cars in a society in which most people were still subsistence<br>farmers; he would have had neither workers nor customers.<br>If you want to reduce economic inequality instead of just improving<br>the overall standard of living, it's not enough just to raise up <br>the poor. What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious<br>and goes on to become another Bill Gates? Economic inequality will<br>be as bad as ever. If you actually want to compress the gap between<br>rich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushing<br>up on the bottom.<br>How do you push down on the top? You could try to decrease the<br>productivity of the people who make the most money: make the best <br>surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors to<br>overeat, and so on. But this approach is hard to implement. The<br>only practical solution is to let people do the best work they can,<br>and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge)<br>to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus.<br>So let's be clear what reducing economic inequality means. It is <br>identical with taking money from the rich.<br>When you transform a mathematical expression into another form, you<br>often notice new things. So it is in this case. Taking money from<br>the rich turns out to have consequences one might not foresee when<br>one phrases the same idea in terms of "reducing inequality."<br>The problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate. A bet <br>with only a 10% chance of winning has to pay more than one with a<br>50% chance of winning, or no one will take it. So if you lop off<br>the top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people's<br>willingness to take risks.<br>Transposing into our original expression, we get: decreasing economic<br>inequality means decreasing the risk people are willing to take.<br>There are whole classes of risks that are no longer worth taking <br>if the maximum return is decreased. One reason high tax rates are<br>disastrous is that this class of risks includes starting new<br>companies.<br>**Investors**<br>Startups are intrinsically risky. A startup<br>is like a small boat<br>in the open sea. One big wave and you're sunk. A competing product,<br>a downturn in the economy, a delay in getting funding or regulatory<br>approval, a patent suit, changing technical standards, the departure<br>of a key employee, the loss of a big account — any one of these can<br>destroy you overnight. It seems only about 1 in 10 startups succeeds.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/inequality.html#f1n)\]<br>Our startup paid its first round of outside investors 36x. Which <br>meant, with current US tax rates, that it made sense to invest in<br>us if we had better than a 1 in 24 chance of succeeding. That <br>sounds about right. That's probably roughly how we looked when we<br>were a couple of nerds with no business experience operating out<br>of an apartment.<br>If that kind of risk doesn't pay, venture investing, as we know it,<br>doesn't happen.<br>That might be ok if there were other sources of capital for new<br>companies. Why not just have the government, or some large<br>almost-government organization like Fannie Mae, do the venture<br>investing instead of private funds?<br>I'll tell you why that wouldn't work. Because then you're asking<br>government or almost-government employees to do the one thing they <br>are least able to do: take risks.<br>As anyone who has worked for the government knows, the important<br>thing is not to make the right choices, but to make choices that<br>can be justified later if they fail. If there is a safe option,<br>that's the one a bureaucrat will choose. But that is exactly the <br>wrong way to do venture investing. The nature of the business means<br>that you want to make terribly risky choices, if the upside looks<br>good enough.<br>VCs are currently <br>[paid](https://paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html) in a way that makes them <br>focus on the upside:<br>they get a percentage of the fund's gains. And that helps overcome<br>their understandable fear of investing in a company run by nerds<br>who look like (and perhaps are) college students.<br>If VCs weren't allowed to get rich, they'd behave like bureaucrats.<br>Without hope of gain, they'd have only fear of loss. And so they'd<br>make the wrong choices. They'd turn down the nerds in favor of the<br>smooth-talking MBA in a suit, because that investment would be<br>easier to justify later if it failed.<br>**Founders**<br>But even if you could somehow redesign venture funding to work<br>without allowing VCs to become rich, there's another kind of investor<br>you simply cannot replace: the startups' founders and early employees.<br>What they invest is their time and ideas. But these are equivalent<br>to money; the proof is that investors are willing (if forced) to<br>treat them as interchangeable, granting the same status to "sweat <br>equity" and the equity they've purchased with cash.<br>The fact that you're investing time doesn't change the relationship<br>between risk and reward. If you're going to invest your time in<br>something with a small chance of succeeding, you'll only do it if<br>there is a proportionately large payoff.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/inequality.html#f2n)\]<br>If large payoffs aren't allowed, you may as well play it safe.<br>Like many startup founders, I did it to get rich. But not because <br>I wanted to buy expensive things. What I wanted was security. I <br>wanted to make enough money that I didn't have to worry about money.<br>If I'd been forbidden to make enough from a startup to do this, I<br>would have sought security by some other means: for example, by<br>going to work for a big, stable organization from which it would<br>be hard to get fired. Instead of busting my ass in a startup, I <br>would have tried to get a nice, low-stress job at a big research <br>lab, or tenure at a university.<br>That's what everyone does in societies where risk isn't rewarded.<br>If you can't ensure your own security, the next best thing is to<br>make a nest for yourself in some large organization where your<br>status depends mostly on [seniority](https://paulgraham.com/ladder.html).<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/inequality.html#f3n)\]<br>Even if we could somehow replace investors, I don't see how we could<br>replace founders. Investors mainly contribute money, which in<br>principle is the same no matter what the source. But the founders<br>contribute ideas. You can't replace those.<br>Let's rehearse the chain of argument so far. I'm heading for a <br>conclusion to which many readers will have to be dragged kicking <br>and screaming, so I've tried to make each link unbreakable. Decreasing<br>economic inequality means taking money from the rich. Since risk<br>and reward are equivalent, decreasing potential rewards automatically<br>decreases people's appetite for risk. Startups are intrinsically<br>risky. Without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk,<br>founders will not invest their time in a startup. Founders are<br>irreplaceable. So eliminating economic inequality means eliminating<br>startups.<br>Economic inequality is not just a consequence of startups.<br>It's the engine that drives them, in the same way a fall of water <br>drives a water mill. People start startups in the hope of becoming<br>much richer than they were before. And if your society tries to<br>prevent anyone from being much richer than anyone else, it will<br>also prevent one person from being much richer at t2 than t1.<br>**Growth**<br>This argument applies proportionately. It's not just that if you <br>eliminate economic inequality, you get no startups. To the extent <br>you reduce economic inequality, you decrease the number of startups.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/inequality.html#f4n)\]<br>Increase taxes, and willingness to take risks decreases in<br>proportion.<br>And that seems bad for everyone. New technology and new jobs both<br>come disproportionately from new companies. Indeed, if you don't<br>have startups, pretty soon you won't have established companies<br>either, just as, if you stop having kids, pretty soon you won't<br>have any adults.<br>It sounds benevolent to say we ought to reduce economic inequality. <br>When you phrase it that way, who can argue with you? _Inequality_<br>has to be bad, right? It sounds a good deal less benevolent to say<br>we ought to reduce the rate at which new companies are founded.<br>And yet the one implies the other.<br>Indeed, it may be that reducing investors' appetite for risk doesn't<br>merely kill off larval startups, but kills off the most promising<br>ones especially. Startups yield faster growth at greater risk than<br>established companies. Does this trend also hold among startups?<br>That is, are the riskiest startups the ones that generate most<br>growth if they succeed? I suspect the answer is yes. And that's <br>a chilling thought, because it means that if you cut investors'<br>appetite for risk, the most beneficial startups are the first to <br>go.<br>Not all rich people got that way from startups, of course. What<br>if we let people get rich by starting startups, but taxed away all<br>other surplus wealth? Wouldn't that at least decrease inequality?<br>Less than you might think. If you made it so that people could<br>only get rich by starting startups, people who wanted to get rich<br>would all start startups. And that might be a great thing. But I<br>don't think it would have much effect on the distribution of wealth.<br>People who want to get rich will do whatever they have to. If<br>startups are the only way to do it, you'll just get far more people<br>starting startups. (If you write the laws very carefully, that is.<br>More likely, you'll just get a lot of people doing things that can<br>be made to look on paper like startups.)<br>If we're determined to eliminate economic inequality, there is still<br>one way out: we could say that we're willing to go ahead and do<br>without startups. What would happen if we did?<br>At a minimum, we'd have to accept lower rates of technological <br>growth. If you believe that large, established companies could <br>somehow be made to develop new technology as fast as startups, the<br>ball is in your court to explain how. (If you can come up with a <br>remotely plausible story, you can make a fortune writing business<br>books and consulting for large companies.)<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/inequality.html#f5n)\]<br>Ok, so we get slower growth. Is that so bad? Well, one reason<br>it's bad in practice is that other countries might not agree to<br>slow down with us. If you're content to develop new technologies<br>at a slower rate than the rest of the world, what happens is that<br>you don't invent anything at all. Anything you might discover has<br>already been invented elsewhere. And the only thing you can offer <br>in return is raw materials and cheap labor. Once you sink that<br>low, other countries can do whatever they like with you: install<br>puppet governments, siphon off your best workers, use your women<br>as prostitutes, dump their toxic waste on your territory — all the<br>things we do to poor countries now. The only defense is to isolate<br>yourself, as communist countries did in the twentieth century. But<br>the problem then is, you have to become a police state to enforce <br>it.<br>**Wealth and Power**<br>I realize startups are not the main target of those who want to<br>eliminate economic inequality. What they really dislike is the<br>sort of wealth that becomes self-perpetuating through an alliance<br>with power. For example, construction firms that fund politicians'<br>campaigns in return for government contracts, or rich parents who <br>get their children into good colleges by sending them to expensive<br>schools designed for that purpose. But if you try to attack this type of wealth<br>through _economic_ policy, it's hard to hit without destroying<br>startups as collateral damage.<br>The problem here is not wealth, but corruption. So why not go after<br>corruption?<br>We don't need to prevent people from being rich if we can prevent<br>wealth from translating into power. And there has been progress<br>on that front. Before he died of drink in 1925, Commodore Vanderbilt's<br>wastrel grandson Reggie ran down pedestrians on five separate <br>occasions, killing two of them. By 1969, when Ted Kennedy drove <br>off the bridge at Chappaquiddick, the limit seemed to be down to <br>one. Today it may well be zero. But what's changed is not variation<br>in wealth. What's changed is the ability to translate wealth into<br>power.<br>How do you break the connection between wealth and power? Demand <br>transparency. Watch closely how power is exercised, and demand an<br>account of how decisions are made. Why aren't all police interrogations<br>videotaped? Why did 36% of Princeton's class of 2007 come from<br>prep schools, when only 1.7% of American kids attend them? Why did<br>the US really invade Iraq? Why don't government officials disclose<br>more about their finances, and why only during their term of office?<br>A friend of mine who knows a lot about computer security says the<br>single most important step is to log everything. Back when he was<br>a kid trying to break into computers, what worried him most was the<br>idea of leaving a trail. He was more inconvenienced by the need <br>to avoid that than by any obstacle deliberately put in his path.<br>Like all illicit connections, the connection between wealth and <br>power flourishes in secret. Expose all transactions, and you will<br>greatly reduce it. Log everything. That's a strategy that already<br>seems to be working, and it doesn't have the side effect of making<br>your whole country poor.<br>I don't think many people realize there is a connection between<br>economic inequality and risk. I didn't fully grasp it till recently.<br>I'd known for years of course that if one didn't score in a startup,<br>the other alternative was to get a cozy, tenured research job. But<br>I didn't understand the equation governing my behavior. Likewise, <br>it's obvious empirically that a country that doesn't let people get<br>rich is headed for disaster, whether it's Diocletian's Rome or <br>Harold Wilson's Britain. But I did not till recently understand<br>the role risk played.<br>If you try to attack wealth, you end up nailing risk as well, and <br>with it growth. If we want a fairer world, I think we're better <br>off attacking one step downstream, where wealth turns into power.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>Success here is defined from the initial investors' point of<br>view: either an IPO, or an acquisition for more than the valuation<br>at the last round of funding. The conventional 1 in 10 success rate<br>is suspiciously neat, but conversations with VCs suggest it's roughly<br>correct for startups overall. Top VC firms expect to do better.<br>\[2\]<br>I'm not claiming founders sit down and calculate the expected <br>after-tax return from a startup. They're motivated by examples of<br>other people who did it. And those examples do reflect after-tax returns.<br>\[3\]<br>Conjecture: The variation in wealth in a (non-corrupt) <br>country or organization<br>will be inversely proportional to the prevalence of systems of<br>seniority. So if you suppress variation in wealth, seniority will<br>become correspondingly more important. So far, I know of no<br>counterexamples, though in very corrupt countries you may get <br>both simultaneously. (Thanks to Daniel Sobral for pointing<br>this out.)<br>\[4\]<br>In a country with a truly feudal economy, you might be able to<br>redistribute wealth successfully, because there are no startups to<br>kill.<br>\[5\]<br>The speed at which startups develop new techology is the other <br>reason they pay so well. As I explained in ["How to Make Wealth"](https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html), what you do in a startup is compress a<br>lifetime's worth of work into a few years. It seems as<br>dumb to discourage that as to discourage risk-taking.<br>**Thanks** to Chris Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Dan Giffin,<br>Jessica Livingston, and Evan Williams for reading drafts of this<br>essay, and to Langley Steinert, Sangam Pant, and Mike Moritz for<br>information about venture investing. |
