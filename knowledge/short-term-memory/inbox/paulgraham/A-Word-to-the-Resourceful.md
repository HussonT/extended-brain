| ![What Kate Saw in Silicon Valley  ](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/what-kate-saw-in-silicon-valley-2.gif)<br>August 2009<br>Kate Courteau is the architect who designed Y Combinator's office.<br>Recently we managed to recruit her to help us run YC when she's not<br>busy with architectural projects. Though she'd heard a lot about<br>YC since the beginning, the last 9 months have been a total immersion.<br>I've been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal<br>to me, so I was curious to hear what had surprised her most about<br>it. This was her list:<br>**1\. How many startups fail.**<br>Kate knew in principle that startups<br>were very risky, but she was surprised to see how constant the<br>threat of failure was â€” not just for the minnows, but even for the<br>famous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners.<br>**2\. How much startups' ideas change.**<br>As usual, by Demo Day about<br>half the startups were doing something significantly different than<br>they started with. We encourage that. Starting a startup is like<br>science in that you have to follow the truth wherever it leads. In<br>the rest of the world, people don't start things till they're sure<br>what they want to do, and once started they tend to continue on their<br>initial path even if it's mistaken.<br>**3\. How little money it can take to start a startup.**<br>In Kate's<br>world, everything is still physical and expensive. You can barely<br>renovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup.<br>**4\. How scrappy founders are.**<br>That was her actual word. I agree<br>with her, but till she mentioned this it never occurred to me how<br>little this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world.<br>It wouldn't be a compliment in most organizations to call someone<br>scrappy.<br>What does it mean, exactly? It's basically the diminutive form of<br>belligerent. Someone who's scrappy manages to be both threatening<br>and undignified at the same time. Which seems to me exactly what<br>one would want to be, in any kind of work. If you're not threatening,<br>you're probably not doing anything new, and dignity is merely a<br>sort of plaque.<br>**5\. How tech-saturated Silicon Valley is.**<br>"It seems like everybody<br>here is in the industry." That isn't literally true, but there is<br>a qualitative difference between Silicon Valley and other places.<br>You tend to keep your voice down, because there's a good chance the<br>person at the next table would know some of the people you're talking<br>about. I never felt that in Boston. The good news is, there's<br>also a good chance the person at the next table could help you in<br>some way.<br>**6\. That the speakers at YC were so consistent in their advice.**<br>Actually, I've noticed this too. I always worry the speakers will<br>put us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell the<br>startups, but it happens surprisingly rarely.<br>When I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers always<br>saying, she mentioned: that the way to succeed was to launch something<br>fast, listen to users, and then iterate; that startups required<br>resilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster; and<br>that most VCs were sheep.<br>I've been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate<br>launching fast and iterating. That was contrarian advice 10 years<br>ago, but it's clearly now the established practice.<br>**7\. How casual successful startup founders are.**<br>Most of the famous<br>founders in Silicon Valley are people you'd overlook on the street.<br>It's not merely that they don't dress up. They don't project any<br>kind of aura of power either. "They're not trying to impress<br>anyone."<br>Interestingly, while Kate said that she could never pick out<br>successful founders, she could recognize VCs, both by the way they<br>dressed and the way they carried themselves.<br>**8\. How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice.**<br>(I swear I didn't prompt this one.) Without advice "they'd just<br>be sort of lost." Fortunately, there are a lot of people to help<br>them. There's a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC-funded<br>startups. But we didn't invent that idea: it's just a slightly<br>more concentrated form of existing Valley culture.<br>**9\. What a solitary task startups are.**<br>Architects are constantly<br>interacting face to face with other people, whereas doing a technology<br>startup, at least, tends to require long stretches of uninterrupted<br>time to work. "You could do it in a box."<br>By inverting this list, we can get a portrait of the "normal" world.<br>It's populated by people who talk a lot with one another as they<br>work slowly but harmoniously on conservative, expensive projects<br>whose destinations are decided in advance, and who carefully adjust<br>their manner to reflect their position in the hierarchy.<br>That's also a fairly accurate description of the past. So startup<br>culture may not merely be different in the way you'd expect any<br>subculture to be, but a leading indicator. |
