| ![The Top of My Todo List](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-top-of-my-todo-list-2.gif)<br>April 2012<br>A palliative care nurse called Bronnie Ware made a list of the<br>biggest [regrets\<br>of the dying](http://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/). Her list seems plausible. I could see<br>myself — _can_ see myself — making at least 4 of these<br>5 mistakes.<br>If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might<br>be: don't be a cog. The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial<br>man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances,<br>then turns dutifully till he stops.<br>The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are<br>all errors of omission. You forget your dreams, ignore your family,<br>suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be<br>happy. Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of<br>mistake, because you make them by default.<br>I would like to avoid making these mistakes. But how do you avoid<br>mistakes you make by default? Ideally you transform your life so<br>it has other defaults. But it may not be possible to do that<br>completely. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably<br>have to be reminded not to make them. So I inverted the 5 regrets,<br>yielding a list of 5 commands<br>> Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you<br>>  think; cultivate friendships; be happy.<br>which I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list. |
