| ![How to Disagree](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-disagree-2.gif)<br>March 2008<br>The web is turning writing into a conversation. Twenty years ago,<br>writers wrote and readers read. The web lets readers respond, and<br>increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their<br>own blog posts.<br>Many who respond to something disagree with it. That's to be<br>expected. Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing.<br>And when you agree there's less to say. You could expand on something<br>the author said, but he has probably already explored the<br>most interesting implications. When you disagree you're entering<br>territory he may not have explored.<br>The result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially<br>measured by the word. That doesn't mean people are getting angrier.<br>The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account<br>for it. But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in<br>disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement<br>will make people angrier. Particularly online, where it's easy to<br>say things you'd never say face to face.<br>If we're all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to<br>do it well. What does it mean to disagree well? Most readers can<br>tell the difference between mere name-calling and a carefully<br>reasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on the<br>intermediate stages. So here's an attempt at a disagreement<br>hierarchy:<br>**DH0. Name-calling.**<br>This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most<br>common. We've all seen comments like this:<br>> u r a fag!!!!!!!!!!<br>But it's important to realize that more articulate name-calling has<br>just as little weight. A comment like<br>> The author is a self-important dilettante.<br>is really nothing more than a pretentious version of "u r a fag."<br>**DH1. Ad Hominem.**<br>An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling. It<br>might actually carry some weight. For example, if a senator wrote<br>an article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could<br>respond:<br>> Of course he would say that. He's a senator.<br>This wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be<br>relevant to the case. It's still a very weak form of disagreement,<br>though. If there's something wrong with the senator's argument,<br>you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does<br>it make that he's a senator?<br>Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic<br>is a variant of ad hominem—and a particularly useless sort, because<br>good ideas often come from outsiders. The question is whether the<br>author is correct or not. If his lack of authority caused him to<br>make mistakes, point those out. And if it didn't, it's not a<br>problem.<br>**DH2. Responding to Tone.**<br>The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather<br>than the writer. The lowest form of these is to disagree with the<br>author's tone. E.g.<br>> I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such<br>>  a cavalier fashion.<br>Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form<br>of disagreement. It matters much more whether the author is wrong<br>or right than what his tone is. Especially since tone is so hard<br>to judge. Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic<br>might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.<br>So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize<br>its tone, you're not saying much. Is the author flippant, but<br>correct? Better that than grave and wrong. And if the author is<br>incorrect somewhere, say where.<br>**DH3. Contradiction.**<br>In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather<br>than how or by whom. The lowest form of response to an argument<br>is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting<br>evidence.<br>This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:<br>> I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such<br>>  a cavalier fashion. Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific<br>>  theory.<br>Contradiction can sometimes have some weight. Sometimes merely<br>seeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that<br>it's right. But usually evidence will help.<br>**DH4. Counterargument.**<br>At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement:<br>counterargument. Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as<br>proving nothing. Counterargument might prove something. The problem<br>is, it's hard to say exactly what.<br>Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence.<br>When aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing.<br>But unfortunately it's common for counterarguments to be aimed at<br>something slightly different. More often than not, two people<br>arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two<br>different things. Sometimes they even agree with one another, but<br>are so caught up in their squabble they don't realize it.<br>There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something<br>slightly different from what the original author said: when you<br>feel they missed the heart of the matter. But when you do that,<br>you should say explicitly you're doing it.<br>**DH5. Refutation.**<br>The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation. It's also<br>the rarest, because it's the most work. Indeed, the disagreement<br>hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you<br>go the fewer instances you find.<br>To refute someone you probably have to quote them. You have to<br>find a "smoking gun," a passage in whatever you disagree with that<br>you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken. If you<br>can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing<br>with a straw man.<br>While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily<br>imply refutation. Some writers quote parts of things they disagree<br>with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow<br>with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0.<br>**DH6. Refuting the Central Point.**<br>The force of a refutation depends on what you refute. The most<br>powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.<br>Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty,<br>as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes<br>those. Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more<br>of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation. For<br>example, correcting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes<br>in names or numbers. Unless the opposing argument actually depends<br>on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to<br>discredit one's opponent.<br>Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point,<br>or at least one of them. And that means one has to commit explicitly<br>to what the central point is. So a truly effective refutation would<br>look like:<br>> The author's main point seems to be x. As he says:<br>> <br>> > <quotation><br>> <br>>  But this is wrong for the following reasons...<br>The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actual<br>statement of the author's main point. It's enough to refute something<br>it depends upon.<br>**What It Means**<br>Now we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement. What good<br>is it? One thing the disagreement hierarchy _doesn't_ give us is<br>a way of picking a winner. DH levels merely describe the form of<br>a statement, not whether it's correct. A DH6 response could still<br>be completely mistaken.<br>But while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness<br>of a reply, they do set an upper bound. A DH6 response might be<br>unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing.<br>The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement<br>is that it will help people to evaluate what they read. In particular,<br>it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments.<br>An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing<br>an opponent merely by using forceful words. In fact that is probably<br>the defining quality of a demagogue. By giving names to the different<br>forms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping<br>such balloons.<br>Such labels may help writers too. Most intellectual dishonesty is<br>unintentional. Someone arguing against the tone of something he<br>disagrees with may believe he's really saying something. Zooming<br>out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy<br>may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.<br>But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it<br>will make conversations better, but that it will make the people<br>who have them happier. If you study conversations, you find there<br>is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6. You don't have<br>to be mean when you have a real point to make. In fact, you don't<br>want to. If you have something real to say, being mean just gets<br>in the way.<br>If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean,<br>that will make most of them happier. Most people don't really enjoy<br>being mean; they do it because they can't help it.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading<br>drafts of this.<br>**Related:** |
