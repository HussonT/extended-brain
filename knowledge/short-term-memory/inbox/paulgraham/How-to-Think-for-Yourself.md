| ![How to Think for Yourself](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-think-for-yourself-4.gif)<br>November 2020<br>There are some kinds of work that you can't do well without thinking<br>differently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for<br>example, it's not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be<br>both correct and novel. You can't publish papers saying things other<br>people already know. You need to say things no one else has realized<br>yet.<br>The same is true for investors. It's not enough for a public market<br>investor to predict correctly how a company will do. If a lot of<br>other people make the same prediction, the stock price will already<br>reflect it, and there's no room to make money. The only valuable<br>insights are the ones most other investors don't share.<br>You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don't want to<br>start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea,<br>or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do<br>something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but<br>that you know isn't — like writing software for a tiny computer<br>used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people<br>rent airbeds on strangers' floors.<br>Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already<br>knew would be boring. You have to tell them something [new](https://paulgraham.com/useful.html).<br>But this pattern isn't universal. In fact, it doesn't hold for most<br>kinds of work. In most kinds of work — to be an administrator, for<br>example — all you need is the first half. All you need is to be<br>right. It's not essential that everyone else be wrong.<br>There's room for a little novelty in most kinds of work, but in<br>practice there's a fairly sharp distinction between the kinds of<br>work where it's essential to be independent-minded, and the kinds<br>where it's not.<br>I wish someone had told me about this distinction when I was a kid,<br>because it's one of the most important things to think about when<br>you're deciding what kind of work you want to do. Do you want to<br>do the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently<br>from everyone else? I suspect most people's unconscious mind will<br>answer that question before their conscious mind has a chance to.<br>I know mine does.<br>Independent-mindedness seems to be more a matter of nature than<br>nurture. Which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you're<br>going to be unhappy. If you're naturally independent-minded, you're<br>going to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. And if you're<br>naturally conventional-minded, you're going to be sailing into a<br>headwind if you try to do original research.<br>One difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken about<br>where they fall on the spectrum from conventional- to independent-minded.<br>Conventional-minded people don't like to think of themselves as<br>conventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them<br>as if they make up their own minds about everything. It's just a<br>coincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers'. And<br>the independent-minded, meanwhile, are often unaware how different<br>their ideas are from conventional ones, at least till they state<br>them publicly.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f1n)\]<br>By the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smart<br>they are (in the narrow sense of ability to solve pre-set problems),<br>because they're constantly being tested and ranked according to it.<br>But schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the<br>extent they try to suppress it. So we don't get anything like the<br>same kind of feedback about how independent-minded we are.<br>There may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, where<br>the most conventional-minded people are confident that they're<br>independent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worry<br>they might not be independent-minded enough.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<br>Can you make yourself more independent-minded? I think so. This<br>quality may be largely inborn, but there seem to be ways to magnify<br>it, or at least not to suppress it.<br>One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally<br>by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs<br>are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're<br>supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people<br>already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would<br>probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and<br>make more effort to find out.<br>It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you're surrounded<br>by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you<br>can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have.<br>But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you'll<br>have the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising<br>things will encourage you to, and to think of more.<br>Because the independent-minded find it uncomfortable to be surrounded<br>by conventional-minded people, they tend to self-segregate once<br>they have a chance to. The problem with high school is that they<br>haven't yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be an<br>inward-looking little world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both<br>of which magnify the forces of conformism. So high school is<br>often a [bad time](https://paulgraham.com/nerds.html) for the<br>independent-minded. But there is some advantage even here: it<br>teaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation<br>that makes you think "this is like high school," you know you should<br>get out.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f2n)\]<br>Another place where the independent- and conventional-minded are<br>thrown together is in successful startups. The founders and early<br>employees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startup<br>wouldn't be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly<br>outnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the<br>original spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted.<br>This causes all kinds of problems besides the obvious one that the<br>company starts to suck. One of the strangest is that the founders<br>find themselves able to speak more freely with founders of other<br>companies than with their own employees.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f3n)\]<br>Fortunately you don't have to spend all your time with independent-minded<br>people. It's enough to have one or two you can talk to regularly.<br>And once you find them, they're usually as eager to talk as you<br>are; they need you too. Although universities no longer have the<br>kind of monopoly they used to have on education, good universities<br>are still an excellent way to meet independent-minded people. Most<br>students will still be conventional-minded, but you'll at least<br>find clumps of independent-minded ones, rather than the near zero<br>you may have found in high school.<br>It also works to go in the other direction: as well as cultivating<br>a small collection of independent-minded friends, to try to meet<br>as many different types of people as you can. It will decrease the<br>influence of your immediate peers if you have several other groups<br>of peers. Plus if you're part of several different worlds, you can<br>often import ideas from one to another.<br>But by different types of people, I don't mean demographically<br>different. For this technique to work, they have to think differently.<br>So while it's an excellent idea to go and visit other countries,<br>you can probably find people who think differently right around the<br>corner. When I meet someone who knows a lot about something unusual<br>(which includes practically everyone, if you dig deep enough), I<br>try to learn what they know that other people don't. There are<br>almost always surprises here. It's a good way to make conversation<br>when you meet strangers, but I don't do it to make conversation.<br>I really want to know.<br>You can expand the source of influences in time as well as space,<br>by reading history. When I read history I do it not just to learn<br>what happened, but to try to get inside the heads of people who<br>lived in the past. How did things look to them? This is hard to do,<br>but worth the effort for the same reason it's worth travelling far<br>to triangulate a point.<br>You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from<br>automatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general is<br>to cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone say<br>something, stop and ask yourself "Is that true?" Don't say it out<br>loud. I'm not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to<br>you the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take<br>upon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.<br>Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later<br>turn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is<br>not to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new<br>ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game<br>should be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for<br>intellectual hygiene. And you'll be surprised, when you start asking<br>"Is this true?", how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If<br>you have any imagination, you're more likely to have too many leads<br>to follow than too few.<br>More generally your goal should be not to let anything into your<br>head unexamined, and things don't always enter your head in the<br>form of statements. Some of the most powerful influences are implicit.<br>How do you even notice these? By standing back and watching how<br>other people get their ideas.<br>When you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas<br>spreading through groups of people like waves. The most obvious are<br>in fashion: you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt,<br>and then more and more, until half the people around you are wearing<br>the same shirt. You may not care much what you wear, but there are<br>intellectual fashions too, and you definitely don't want to participate<br>in those. Not just because you want sovereignty over your own<br>thoughts, but because [unfashionable](https://paulgraham.com/nov.html)<br>ideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere interesting.<br>The best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else is<br>looking.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f4n)\]<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<br>To go beyond this general advice, we need to look at the internal<br>structure of independent-mindedness — at the individual muscles<br>we need to exercise, as it were. It seems to me that it has three<br>components: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told<br>what to think, and curiosity.<br>Fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things<br>that are false. It means being careful about degree of belief. For<br>most people, degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes:<br>the unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f5n)\]<br>To the independent-minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy.<br>They're willing to have anything in their heads, from highly<br>speculative hypotheses to (apparent) tautologies, but on subjects<br>they care about, everything has to be labelled with a carefully<br>considered degree of belief.<br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f6n)\]<br>The independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which<br>require one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once, and<br>to treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded person<br>that would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious<br>about food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a<br>large variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance.<br>Without this fastidiousness about truth, you can't be truly<br>independent-minded. It's not enough just to have resistance to being<br>told what to think. Those kind of people reject conventional ideas<br>only to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories. And<br>since these conspiracy theories have often been manufactured to<br>capture them, they end up being less independent-minded than ordinary<br>people, because they're subject to a much more exacting master than<br>mere convention.<br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f7n)\]<br>Can you increase your fastidiousness about truth? I would think so.<br>In my experience, merely thinking about something you're fastidious<br>about causes that fastidiousness to grow. If so, this is one of<br>those rare virtues we can have more of merely by wanting it. And<br>if it's like other forms of fastidiousness, it should also be<br>possible to encourage in children. I certainly got a strong dose<br>of it from my father.<br>\[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f8n)\]<br>The second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to being<br>told what to think, is the most visible of the three. But even this<br>is often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is to<br>think of it as a merely negative quality. The language we use<br>reinforces that idea. You're _un_ conventional. You _don't_ care<br>what other people think. But it's not just a kind of immunity. In<br>the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what<br>to think is a positive force. It's not mere skepticism, but an<br>active [delight](https://paulgraham.com/gba.html) in ideas that subvert<br>the conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better.<br>Some of the most novel ideas seemed at the time almost like practical<br>jokes. Think how often your reaction to a novel idea is to laugh.<br>I don't think it's because novel ideas are funny per se, but because<br>novelty and humor share a certain kind of surprisingness. But while<br>not identical, the two are close enough that there is a definite<br>correlation between having a sense of humor and being independent-minded<br>— just as there is between being humorless and being conventional-minded.<br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f9n)\]<br>I don't think we can significantly increase our resistance to being<br>told what to think. It seems the most innate of the three components<br>of independent-mindedness; people who have this quality as adults<br>usually showed all too visible signs of it as children. But if we<br>can't increase our resistance to being told what to think, we can<br>at least shore it up, by surrounding ourselves with other<br>independent-minded people.<br>The third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may be<br>the most interesting. To the extent that we can give a brief answer<br>to the question of where novel ideas come from, it's curiosity. That's<br>what people are usually feeling before having them.<br>In my experience, independent-mindedness and curiosity predict one<br>another perfectly. Everyone I know who's independent-minded is<br>deeply curious, and everyone I know who's conventional-minded isn't.<br>Except, curiously, children. All small children are curious. Perhaps<br>the reason is that even the conventional-minded have to be curious<br>in the beginning, in order to learn what the conventions are. Whereas<br>the independent-minded are the gluttons of curiosity, who keep<br>eating even after they're full.<br>\[ [10](https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f10n)\]<br>The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert:<br>fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to<br>think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to<br>fill it.<br>Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another<br>in much the same way muscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious<br>about truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what<br>to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps<br>in your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity,<br>because if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort<br>at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity<br>can compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't<br>need to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover<br>will push out the conventional ones you acquired by default.<br>Because the components of independent-mindedness are so interchangeable,<br>you can have them to varying degrees and still get the same result.<br>So there is not just a single model of independent-mindedness. Some<br>independent-minded people are openly subversive, and others are<br>quietly curious. They all know the secret handshake though.<br>Is there a way to cultivate curiosity? To start with, you want to<br>avoid situations that suppress it. How much does the work you're<br>currently doing engage your curiosity? If the answer is "not much,"<br>maybe you should change something.<br>The most important active step you can take to cultivate your<br>curiosity is probably to seek out the topics that engage it. Few<br>adults are equally curious about everything, and it doesn't seem<br>as if you can choose which topics interest you. So it's up to you<br>to [find](https://paulgraham.com/genius.html) them. Or invent them, if<br>necessary.<br>Another way to increase your curiosity is to indulge it, by<br>investigating things you're interested in. Curiosity is unlike<br>most other appetites in this respect: indulging it tends to increase<br>rather than to sate it. Questions lead to more questions.<br>Curiosity seems to be more individual than fastidiousness about<br>truth or resistance to being told what to think. To the degree<br>people have the latter two, they're usually pretty general, whereas<br>different people can be curious about very different things. So<br>perhaps curiosity is the compass here. Perhaps, if your goal is to<br>discover novel ideas, your motto should not be "do what you love"<br>so much as "do what you're curious about."<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>One convenient consequence of the fact that no one identifies<br>as conventional-minded is that you can say what you like about<br>conventional-minded people without getting in too much trouble.<br>When I wrote ["The Four Quadrants of\<br>Conformism"](https://paulgraham.com/conformism.html) I expected a firestorm of rage from the<br>aggressively conventional-minded, but in fact it was quite muted.<br>They sensed that there was something about the essay that they<br>disliked intensely, but they had a hard time finding a specific<br>passage to pin it on.<br>\[2\]<br>When I ask myself what in my life is like high school, the<br>answer is Twitter. It's not just full of conventional-minded people,<br>as anything its size will inevitably be, but subject to violent<br>storms of conventional-mindedness that remind me of descriptions<br>of Jupiter. But while it probably is a net loss to spend time there,<br>it has at least made me think more about the distinction between<br>independent- and conventional-mindedness, which I probably wouldn't<br>have done otherwise.<br>\[3\]<br>The decrease in independent-mindedness in growing startups is<br>still an open problem, but there may be solutions.<br>Founders can delay the problem by making a conscious effort only<br>to hire independent-minded people. Which of course also has the<br>ancillary benefit that they have better ideas.<br>Another possible solution is to create policies that somehow disrupt<br>the force of conformism, much as control rods slow chain reactions,<br>so that the conventional-minded aren't as dangerous. The physical<br>separation of Lockheed's Skunk Works may have had this as a side<br>benefit. Recent examples suggest employee forums like Slack may not<br>be an unmitigated good.<br>The most radical solution would be to grow revenues without growing<br>the company. You think hiring that junior PR person will be cheap,<br>compared to a programmer, but what will be the effect on the average<br>level of independent-mindedness in your company? (The growth in<br>staff relative to faculty seems to have had a similar effect on<br>universities.) Perhaps the rule about outsourcing work that's not<br>your "core competency" should be augmented by one about outsourcing<br>work done by people who'd ruin your culture as employees.<br>Some investment firms already seem to be able to grow revenues<br>without growing the number of employees. Automation plus the ever<br>increasing articulation of the "tech stack" suggest this may one<br>day be possible for product companies.<br>\[4\]<br>There are intellectual fashions in every field, but their<br>influence varies. One of the reasons politics, for example, tends<br>to be boring is that it's so extremely subject to them. The threshold<br>for having opinions about politics is much [lower](https://paulgraham.com/identity.html) than the one for having<br>opinions about set theory. So while there are some ideas in politics,<br>in practice they tend to be swamped by waves of intellectual fashion.<br>\[5\]<br>The conventional-minded are often fooled by the strength of<br>their opinions into believing that they're independent-minded. But<br>strong convictions are not a sign of independent-mindedness. Rather<br>the opposite.<br>\[6\]<br>Fastidiousness about truth doesn't imply that an independent-minded<br>person won't be dishonest, but that he won't be deluded. It's sort<br>of like the definition of a gentleman as someone who is never<br>unintentionally rude.<br>\[7\]<br>You see this especially among political extremists. They think<br>themselves nonconformists, but actually they're niche conformists.<br>Their opinions may be different from the average person's, but they<br>are often more influenced by their peers' opinions than the average<br>person's are.<br>\[8\]<br>If we broaden the concept of fastidiousness about truth so that<br>it excludes pandering, bogusness, and pomposity as well as falsehood<br>in the strict sense, our model of independent-mindedness can expand<br>further into the arts.<br>\[9\]<br>This correlation is far from perfect, though. Gödel and Dirac<br>don't seem to have been very strong in the humor department. But<br>someone who is both "neurotypical" and humorless is very likely to<br>be conventional-minded.<br>\[10\]<br>Exception: gossip. Almost everyone is curious about gossip.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Jessica<br>Livingston, Robert Morris, Harj Taggar, and Peter Thiel for reading<br>drafts of this. |
