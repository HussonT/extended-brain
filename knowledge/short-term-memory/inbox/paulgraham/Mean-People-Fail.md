| ![Mean People Fail](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/mean-people-fail-4.gif)<br>November 2014<br>It struck me recently how few of the most successful people I know<br>are mean. There are exceptions, but remarkably few.<br>Meanness isn't rare. In fact, one of the things the internet has<br>shown us is how mean people can be. A few decades ago, only famous<br>people and professional writers got to publish their opinions. Now<br>everyone can, and we can all see the long tail of<br>meanness that had previously been hidden.<br>And yet while there are clearly a lot of mean people out there,<br>there are next to none among the most successful people I know.<br>What's going on here? Are meanness and success inversely correlated?<br>Part of what's going on, of course, is selection bias. I only know<br>people who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers,<br>professors. I'm willing to believe that successful people in other<br>fields are mean. Maybe successful hedge fund managers are mean; I<br>don't know enough to say. It seems quite likely that most successful<br>drug lords are mean. But there are at least big chunks of the world<br>that mean people don't rule, and that territory seems to be growing.<br>My wife and Y Combinator cofounder Jessica is one of those rare<br>people who have x-ray vision for character. Being married to her<br>is like standing next to an airport baggage scanner. She came to<br>the startup world from investment banking, and she has always been<br>struck both by how consistently successful startup founders turn<br>out to be good people, and how consistently bad people fail as<br>startup founders.<br>Why? I think there are several reasons. One is that being mean<br>makes you stupid. That's why I hate fights. You never do your best<br>work in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general.<br>Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.<br>You don't win fights by thinking of big ideas but by thinking of<br>tricks that work in one particular case. And yet fighting is just<br>as much work as thinking about real problems. Which is particularly<br>painful to someone who cares how their brain is used: your brain<br>goes fast but you get nowhere, like a car spinning its wheels.<br>Startups don't win by attacking. They win by transcending. There<br>are exceptions of course, but usually the way to win is to race<br>ahead, not to stop and fight.<br>Another reason mean founders lose is that they can't get the best<br>people to work for them. They can hire people who will put up with<br>them because they need a job. But the best people have other options.<br>A mean person can't convince the best people to work for him unless<br>he is super convincing. And while having the best people helps any<br>organization, it's critical for startups.<br>There is also a complementary force at work: if you want to build<br>great things, it helps to be driven by a spirit of benevolence. The startup founders who end up<br>richest are not the ones driven by money. The ones driven by money<br>take the big acquisition offer that nearly every successful startup<br>gets en route.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/mean.html#f1n)\]<br>The ones who keep going are driven by something<br>else. They may not say so explicitly, but they're usually trying<br>to improve the world. Which means people with a desire to improve<br>the world have a natural advantage.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/mean.html#f2n)\]<br>The exciting thing is that startups are not just one random type<br>of work in which meanness and success are inversely correlated.<br>This kind of work is the future.<br>For most of history success meant control of scarce resources. One<br>got that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoral<br>nomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphorically<br>in the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one another<br>to assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meant<br>success at zero-sum games. And in most of them meanness was not a<br>handicap but probably an advantage.<br>That is changing. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum.<br>Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce<br>resource, but by having new ideas and building new things.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/mean.html#f3n)\]<br>There have long been games where you won by having new ideas. In<br>the third century BC, Archimedes won by doing that. At least until<br>an invading Roman army killed him. Which illustrates why<br>this change is happening: for new ideas to matter, you need a certain<br>degree of civil order. And not just not being at war. You also<br>need to prevent the sort of economic violence that nineteenth century<br>magnates practiced against one another and communist countries<br>practiced against their citizens. People need to feel that what<br>they create can't be stolen.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/mean.html#f4n)\]<br>That has always been the case for thinkers, which is why this trend<br>began with them. When you think of successful people from history<br>who weren't ruthless, you get mathematicians and writers and artists.<br>The exciting thing is that their m.o. seems to be spreading. The<br>games played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, and<br>this is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between<br>meanness and success.<br>So I'm really glad I stopped to think about this. Jessica and I<br>have always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean. We<br>tolerate noise and mess and junk food, but not meanness. And now<br>I have both an additional reason to crack down on it, and an<br>additional argument to use when I do: that being mean makes you<br>fail.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>I'm not saying all founders who take big acquisition offers<br>are driven only by money, but rather that those who don't aren't.<br>Plus one can have benevolent motives for being driven by money â€” for <br>example, to take care of one's family, or to be free to work<br>on projects that improve the world.<br>\[2\]<br>It's unlikely that every successful startup improves the<br>world. But their founders, like parents, truly believe they do.<br>Successful founders are in love with their companies. And while<br>this sort of love is as blind as the love people have for one<br>another, it is genuine.<br>\[3\]<br>[Peter \<br>Thiel](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec05) would point out that successful founders still<br>get rich from controlling monopolies, just monopolies they create<br>rather than ones they capture. And while this is largely true, it<br>means a big change in the sort of person who wins.<br>\[4\]<br>To be fair, the Romans didn't mean to kill Archimedes. The<br>Roman commander specifically ordered that he be spared. But he got<br>killed in the chaos anyway.<br>In sufficiently disordered times, even thinking requires<br>control of scarce resources, because living at all is a scarce<br>resource.<br>**Thanks** to Sam Altman, Ron Conway, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris,<br>Geoff Ralston, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this. |
