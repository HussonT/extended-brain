| ![Mind the Gap](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/mind-the-gap-2.gif)<br>May 2004<br>When people care enough about something to do it well, those who<br>do it best tend to be far better than everyone else. There's a<br>huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like<br>Borgognone. You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the<br>average writer of detective novels. A top-ranked professional chess<br>player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player<br>without losing once.<br>Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very<br>specialized skill. But for some reason we treat this skill<br>differently. No one complains when a few people surpass all the<br>rest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make<br>more money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.<br>Why? The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other<br>skill. What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is<br>making money?<br>I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different:<br>the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable<br>way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and<br>the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for<br>society. As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second<br>outdated, and the third empirically false. Could it be that, in a<br>modern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health?<br>**The Daddy Model of Wealth**<br>When I was five I thought electricity was created by electric<br>sockets. I didn't realize there were power plants out there<br>generating it. Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth<br>is something that has to be generated. It seems to be something<br>that flows from parents.<br>Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children<br>tend to misunderstand wealth. They confuse it with money. They<br>think that there is a fixed amount of it. And they think of it as<br>something that's distributed by authorities (and so should be<br>distributed equally), rather than something that has to be created<br>(and might be created unequally).<br>In fact, wealth is not money. Money is just a convenient way of<br>trading one form of wealth for another. Wealth is the underlying<br>stuff—the goods and services we buy. When you travel to a<br>rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank<br>accounts to tell which kind you're in. You can _see_<br>wealth—in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health<br>of the people.<br>Where does wealth come from? People make it. This was easier to<br>grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things<br>they wanted with their own hands. Then you could see in the house,<br>the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created. It<br>was obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed<br>quantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie. If you<br>wanted more wealth, you could make it.<br>This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly<br>for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks). Mostly<br>we create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we<br>then trade for the forms of wealth we want. <br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f1n)\]<br>Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has<br>to be given to them. And when wealth is something you're given,<br>then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f2n)\]<br>As in most families it is. The kids see to that. "Unfair," they<br>cry, when one sibling gets more than another.<br>In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents. If you<br>want something, you either have to make it, or do something of<br>equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you<br>enough money to buy it. In the real world, wealth is (except for<br>a few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have<br>to create, not something that's distributed by Daddy. And since<br>the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person,<br>it's not made equally.<br>You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those<br>who make more money are often simply better at doing what people<br>want. Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors. The<br>B-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people go<br>to the theater and look at the list of movies playing, they want<br>that extra oomph that the big stars have.<br>Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course.<br>You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly.<br>Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for<br>some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root<br>cause of variation in income. The root cause of variation in income,<br>as Occam's Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation<br>in every other human skill.<br>In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about<br>100 times as much as the average person. <br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f3n)\]<br>Basketball players<br>make about 128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much.<br>Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror. But I have<br>no trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive<br>as another. In ancient Rome the price of _slaves_ varied by<br>a factor of 50 depending on their skills. <br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f4n)\]<br>And that's without<br>considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that<br>you can get from modern technology.<br>Editorials about athletes' or CEOs' salaries remind me of early<br>Christian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the<br>Earth was round, when they could just walk outside and check.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f5n)\]<br>How much someone's work is worth is not a policy question. It's<br>something the market already determines.<br>"Are they really worth 100 of us?" editorialists ask. Depends on<br>what you mean by worth. If you mean worth in the sense of what<br>people will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.<br>A few CEOs' incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing. But are there<br>not others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate?<br>Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline. And not<br>merely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs;<br>he had to decide what Apple's next products should be. Few others<br>could have done it. And regardless of the case with CEOs, it's<br>hard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional<br>basketball players don't reflect supply and demand.<br>It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really<br>generate so much more wealth than another. The key to this mystery<br>is to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us?<br>_Would_ a basketball team trade one of their players for 100<br>random people? What would Apple's next product look like if you<br>replaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people? <br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f6n)\]<br>These<br>things don't scale linearly. Perhaps the CEO or the professional<br>athlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and<br>determination of an ordinary person. But it makes all the difference<br>that it's concentrated in one individual.<br>When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid,<br>what are we really saying? In a free market, prices are determined<br>by what buyers want. People like baseball more than poetry, so<br>baseball players make more than poets. To say that a certain kind<br>of work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want<br>the wrong things.<br>Well, of course people want the wrong things. It seems odd to be<br>surprised by that. And it seems even odder to say that it's<br>_unjust_ that certain kinds of work are underpaid. <br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f7n)\]<br>Then<br>you're saying that it's unjust that people want the wrong things.<br>It's lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to<br>Shakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust? That seems like<br>saying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.<br>The appearance of the word "unjust" here is the unmistakable spectral<br>signature of the Daddy Model. Why else would this idea occur in<br>this odd context? Whereas if the speaker were still operating on<br>the Daddy Model, and saw wealth as something that flowed from a<br>common source and had to be shared out, rather than something<br>generated by doing what other people wanted, this is exactly what<br>you'd get on noticing that some people made much more than others.<br>When we talk about "unequal distribution of income," we should<br>also ask, where does that income come from?<br>\[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f8n)\]<br>Who made the wealth<br>it represents? Because to the extent that income varies simply<br>according to how much wealth people create, the distribution may<br>be unequal, but it's hardly unjust.<br>**Stealing It**<br>The second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth<br>alarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate<br>a fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding;<br>in agricultural societies by appropriating others' estates in times<br>of war, and taxing them in times of peace.<br>In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates<br>confiscated from the losers. In England in the 1060s, when William<br>the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon<br>nobles to his followers, the conflict was military. By the 1530s,<br>when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his<br>followers, it was mostly political. <br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f9n)\]<br>But the principle was the<br>same. Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.<br>In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials<br>used taxation instead of confiscation. But here too we see the<br>same principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, but<br>to serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.<br>This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class.<br>Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor<br>poor, but originally they were a distinct group. In a feudal<br>society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the<br>serfs who work their estates. The middle class were a new, third<br>group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing<br>and trade.<br>Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and<br>former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful<br>enough to ignore the local feudal lords. <br>\[ [10](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f10n)\]<br>Like serfs, the middle<br>class made a living largely by creating wealth. (In port cities<br>like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs<br>they had an incentive to create a lot of it. Any wealth a serf<br>created belonged to his master. There was not much point in making<br>more than you could hide. Whereas the independence of the townsmen<br>allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.<br>Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as<br>a whole started to get richer very rapidly. Nearly everything we<br>have was created by the middle class. Indeed, the other two classes<br>have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their<br>names been given to either end of the middle class. (In the original<br>sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)<br>But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation<br>definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich. In<br>England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in<br>fact only started to be called "corruption") when there started to<br>be other, faster ways to get rich.<br>Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today,<br>in that government office was a recognized route to wealth. The<br>great fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would<br>now call corruption than from commerce. <br>\[ [11](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f11n)\]<br>By the nineteenth<br>century that had changed. There continued to be bribes, as there<br>still are everywhere, but politics had by then been left to men who<br>were driven more by vanity than greed. Technology had made it<br>possible to create wealth faster than you could steal it. The<br>prototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier<br>but an industrialist.<br>With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum<br>game. Jobs and Wozniak didn't have to make us poor to make themselves<br>rich. Quite the opposite: they created things that made our lives<br>materially richer. They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them.<br>But since for most of the world's history the main route to wealth<br>was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people. Idealistic<br>undergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child's model of<br>wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past. It is a case of<br>the mistaken meeting the outdated.<br>"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime," Balzac wrote. Except<br>he didn't. What he actually said was that a great fortune with no<br>apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed<br>that it had been forgotten. If we were talking about Europe in<br>1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation<br>would be spot on. But Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France,<br>where the Industrial Revolution was well advanced. He knew you<br>could make a fortune without stealing it. After all, he did himself,<br>as a popular novelist.<br>\[ [12](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f12n)\]<br>Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have<br>reached this stage. In most, corruption still has the upper hand.<br>In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it. And so<br>when we see increasing differences in income in a rich country,<br>there is a tendency to worry that it's sliding back toward becoming<br>another Venezuela. I think the opposite is happening. I think<br>you're seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela.<br>**The Lever of Technology**<br>Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor? It will<br>certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.<br>That's the whole point of technology. With a tractor an energetic<br>farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with<br>a team of horses. But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.<br>I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time. In<br>high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at<br>Baskin-Robbins. This was the only kind of work available at the<br>time. Now high school kids could write software or design web<br>sites. But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping<br>ice cream.<br>I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it<br>possible for me to buy a computer of my own. Within months I was<br>using it to make money as a freelance programmer. A few years<br>before, I couldn't have done this. A few years before, there was<br>no such _thing_ as a freelance programmer. But Apple created<br>wealth, in the form of powerful, inexpensive computers, and programmers<br>immediately set to work using it to create more.<br>As this example suggests, the rate at which technology increases<br>our productive capacity is probably exponential, rather than linear.<br>So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual<br>productivity as time goes on. Will that increase the gap between<br>rich and the poor? Depends which gap you mean.<br>Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to<br>decrease other gaps. A hundred years ago, the rich led a different<br>_kind_ of life from ordinary people. They lived in houses<br>full of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and<br>travelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves<br>required their own houses and servants. Now, thanks to technology,<br>the rich live more like the average person.<br>Cars are a good example of why. It's possible to buy expensive,<br>handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. But there<br>is not much point. Companies make more money by building a large<br>number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones. So<br>a company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more<br>on its design. If you buy a custom-made car, something will always<br>be breaking. The only point of buying one now is to advertise that<br>you can.<br>Or consider watches. Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money<br>on a watch you could get better performance. When watches had<br>mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time. Not any<br>more. Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex<br>is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands<br>of dollars.<br>\[ [13](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f13n)\]<br>Indeed, as with expensive cars, if you're determined<br>to spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with some<br>inconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanical<br>watches have to be wound.<br>The only thing technology can't cheapen is brand. Which is precisely<br>why we hear ever more about it. Brand is the residue left as the<br>substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate. But what<br>label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having<br>it versus not having it. In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one<br>asked what year or brand it was. If you had one, you were rich.<br>And if you weren't rich, you took the omnibus or walked. Now even<br>the poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we're so<br>well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially<br>expensive ones.<br>\[ [14](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f14n)\]<br>The same pattern has played out in industry after industry. If<br>there is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap<br>enough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versions<br>will be, if not better, at least more convenient.<br>\[ [15](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f15n)\]<br>And there<br>is nothing the rich like more than convenience. The rich people I<br>know drive the same cars, wear the same clothes, have the same kind<br>of furniture, and eat the same foods as my other friends. Their<br>houses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood<br>are different sizes, but within them life is similar. The houses<br>are made using the same construction techniques and contain much<br>the same objects. It's inconvenient to do something expensive and<br>custom.<br>The rich spend their time more like everyone else too. Bertie<br>Wooster seems long gone. Now, most people who are rich enough not<br>to work do anyway. It's not just social pressure that makes them;<br>idleness is lonely and demoralizing.<br>Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years<br>ago. The novels and etiquette manuals of that period read now<br>like descriptions of some strange tribal society. "With respect<br>to the continuance of friendships..." hints _Mrs. Beeton's Book_<br>_of Household Management_ (1880), "it may be found necessary, in<br>some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility<br>of a household, many of those commenced in the earlier part of her<br>life." A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friends<br>who didn't. You'd seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.<br>You'd also have a very boring life. People still tend to segregate<br>themselves somewhat, but much more on the basis of education than<br>wealth.<br>\[ [16](https://paulgraham.com/gap.html#f16n)\]<br>Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap<br>between the rich and the poor, not increasing it. If Lenin walked<br>around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he'd<br>think communism had won. Everyone would be wearing the same clothes,<br>have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same<br>furnishings, and address one another by their first names instead<br>of by honorifics. Everything would seem exactly as he'd predicted,<br>until he looked at their bank accounts. Oops.<br>Is it a problem if technology increases that gap? It doesn't seem<br>to be so far. As it increases the gap in income, it seems to<br>decrease most other gaps.<br>**Alternative to an Axiom**<br>One often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would<br>increase the income gap between rich and poor. As if it were an<br>axiom that this would be bad. It might be true that increased<br>variation in income would be bad, but I don't see how we can say<br>it's _axiomatic._<br>Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies. In a<br>society of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a<br>sign of an underlying problem. But serfdom is not the only cause<br>of variation in income. A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much<br>as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her<br>in thrall. His skills are simply much more valuable.<br>I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society,<br>increasing variation in income is a sign of health. Technology<br>seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than<br>linear rates. If we don't see corresponding variation in income,<br>there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation<br>has stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth<br>aren't doing it, or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it.<br>I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad. If you<br>disagree, try living for a year using only the resources available<br>to the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us.<br>(I'll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)<br>The only option, if you're going to have an increasingly prosperous<br>society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c),<br>that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.<br>That Jobs and Wozniak, for example, will cheerfully work 20-hour<br>days to produce the Apple computer for a society that allows them,<br>after taxes, to keep just enough of their income to match what they<br>would have made working 9 to 5 at a big company.<br>Will people create wealth if they can't get paid for it? Only if<br>it's fun. People will write operating systems for free. But they<br>won't install them, or take support calls, or train customers to<br>use them. And at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech<br>companies do is of this second, unedifying kind.<br>All the unfun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a society<br>that confiscates private fortunes. We can confirm this empirically.<br>Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a<br>nearby fan. You turn the fan off, and the noise stops. You turn<br>the fan back on, and the noise starts again. Off, quiet. On,<br>noise. In the absence of other information, it would seem the noise<br>is caused by the fan.<br>At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulate<br>a fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off. Northern<br>Italy in 800, off (warlords would steal it). Northern Italy in<br>1100, on. Central France in 1100, off (still feudal). England in<br>1800, on. England in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income).<br>United States in 1974, on. We've even had a twin study: West<br>Germany, on; East Germany, off. In every case, the creation of<br>wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you<br>switch on and off the prospect of keeping it.<br>There is some momentum involved. It probably takes at least a<br>generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).<br>But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra<br>baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one<br>would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.<br>If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private<br>fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as<br>some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be<br>the same. Society as a whole ends up poorer.<br>If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially<br>much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one<br>where I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I'd take<br>the first option. If I had children, it would arguably be immoral<br>not to. It's absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative<br>poverty. If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one<br>or the other in your society, take relative poverty.<br>You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending<br>their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do<br>to _get_ rich. I'm not talking about the trickle-down effect<br>here. I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll<br>hire you as a waiter at his next party. I'm saying that he'll make<br>you a tractor to replace your horse.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some<br>of those most vocal on the subject of wealth—university<br>students, heirs, professors, politicians, and journalists—have<br>the least experience creating it. (This phenomenon will be familiar<br>to anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)<br>Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped<br>to think about where that money comes from. Heirs will be on the<br>parental dole for life. Professors and politicians live within<br>socialist eddies of the economy, at one remove from the creation<br>of wealth, and are paid a flat rate regardless of how hard they<br>work. And journalists as part of their professional code segregate<br>themselves from the revenue-collecting half of the businesses they<br>work for (the ad sales department). Many of these people never<br>come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents<br>wealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone<br>else created earlier. They live in a world in which income _is_<br>doled out by a central authority according to some abstract notion<br>of fairness (or randomly, in the case of heirs), rather than given<br>by other people in return for something they wanted, so it may seem<br>to them unfair that things don't work the same in the rest of the<br>economy.<br>(Some professors do create a great deal of wealth for<br>society. But the money they're paid isn't a _quid pro quo_.<br>It's more in the nature of an investment.)<br>\[2\]<br>When one reads about the origins of the Fabian Society, it<br>sounds like something cooked up by the high-minded Edwardian<br>child-heroes of Edith Nesbit's _The Wouldbegoods_.<br>\[3\]<br>According to a study by the Corporate Library, the median total<br>compensation, including salary, bonus, stock grants, and the exercise<br>of stock options, of S&P 500 CEOs in 2002 was $3.65 million.<br>According to _Sports Illustrated_, the average NBA player's<br>salary during the 2002-03 season was $4.54 million, and the average<br>major league baseball player's salary at the start of the 2003<br>season was $2.56 million. According to the Bureau of Labor<br>Statistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.<br>\[4\]<br>In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems<br>to have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g. Horace, _Sat._ ii.7.43).<br>A servant girl cost 600 (Martial vi.66), while Columella (iii.3.8)<br>says that a skilled vine-dresser was worth 8,000. A doctor, P.<br>Decimus Eros Merula, paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom (Dessau,<br>_Inscriptiones_ 7812). Seneca ( _Ep._ xxvii.7) reports<br>that one Calvisius Sabinus paid 100,000 sestertii apiece for slaves<br>learned in the Greek classics. Pliny ( _Hist. Nat._ vii.39)<br>says that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was<br>700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis,<br>but that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own<br>freedom.<br>Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices. An ordinary<br>laborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae. Xenophon ( _Mem._<br>ii.5) mentions prices ranging from 50 to 6,000 drachmae (for the<br>manager of a silver mine).<br>For more on the economics of ancient slavery see:<br>Jones, A. H. M., "Slavery in the Ancient World," _Economic History_<br>_Review_, 2:9 (1956), 185-199, reprinted in Finley, M. I. (ed.),<br>_Slavery in Classical Antiquity_, Heffer, 1964.<br>\[5\]<br>Eratosthenes (276—195 BC) used shadow lengths in different<br>cities to estimate the Earth's circumference. He was off by only<br>about 2%.<br>\[6\]<br>No, and Windows, respectively.<br>\[7\]<br>One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and<br>reality is the valuation of hard work. In the Daddy Model, hard<br>work is in itself deserving. In reality, wealth is measured by<br>what one delivers, not how much effort it costs. If I paint someone's<br>house, the owner shouldn't pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.<br>It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy<br>Model that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn't get<br>paid much. To help clarify the matter, get rid of everyone else<br>and put our worker on a desert island, hunting and gathering fruit.<br>If he's bad at it he'll work very hard and not end up with much<br>food. Is this unfair? Who is being unfair to him?<br>\[8\]<br>Part of the reason for the tenacity of the Daddy Model may be<br>the dual meaning of "distribution." When economists talk about<br>"distribution of income," they mean statistical distribution. But<br>when you use the phrase frequently, you can't help associating it<br>with the other sense of the word (as in e.g. "distribution of alms"),<br>and thereby subconsciously seeing wealth as something that flows<br>from some central tap. The word "regressive" as applied to tax<br>rates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything<br>_regressive_ be good?<br>\[9\]<br>"From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous<br>courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards.<br>In 1525 he was made a Knight of the Garter and given the Earldom<br>of Rutland. In the thirties his support of the breach with Rome,<br>his zeal in crushing the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his readiness to<br>vote the death-penalty in the succession of spectacular treason<br>trials that punctuated Henry's erratic matrimonial progress made<br>him an obvious candidate for grants of monastic property."<br>Stone, Lawrence, _Family and Fortune: Studies in Aristocratic_<br>_Finance in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries_, Oxford<br>University Press, 1973, p. 166.<br>\[10\]<br>There is archaeological evidence for large settlements earlier,<br>but it's hard to say what was happening in them.<br>Hodges, Richard and David Whitehouse, _Mohammed, Charlemagne and_<br>_the Origins of Europe_, Cornell University Press, 1983.<br>\[11\]<br>William Cecil and his son Robert were each in turn the most<br>powerful minister of the crown, and both used their position to<br>amass fortunes among the largest of their times. Robert in particular<br>took bribery to the point of treason. "As Secretary of State and<br>the leading advisor to King James on foreign policy, \[he\] was a<br>special recipient of favour, being offered large bribes by the Dutch<br>not to make peace with Spain, and large bribes by Spain to make<br>peace." (Stone, _op. cit._, p. 17.)<br>\[12\]<br>Though Balzac made a lot of money from writing, he was notoriously<br>improvident and was troubled by debts all his life.<br>\[13\]<br>A Timex will gain or lose about .5 seconds per day. The most<br>accurate mechanical watch, the Patek Philippe 10 Day Tourbillon,<br>is rated at -1.5 to +2 seconds. Its retail price is about $220,000.<br>\[14\]<br>If asked to choose which was more expensive, a well-preserved<br>1989 Lincoln Town Car ten-passenger limousine ($5,000) or a 2004<br>Mercedes S600 sedan ($122,000), the average Edwardian might well<br>guess wrong.<br>\[15\]<br>To say anything meaningful about income trends, you have to<br>talk about real income, or income as measured in what it can buy.<br>But the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the<br>growth in wealth over time, because it depends on a consumer price<br>index created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are<br>only locally accurate, and that don't include the prices of new<br>inventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize.<br>So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world<br>with antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than<br>without, real income statistics calculated in the usual way will<br>prove to us that we are only slightly richer for having these things.<br>Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the<br>year x in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade<br>goods to make your fortune? For example, if you were going back<br>to 1970 it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing<br>power you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least<br>$150 million in 1970. The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly,<br>because for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you<br>needed in present-day trash. In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle<br>with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.<br>\[16\]<br>Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich<br>have better opportunities for education. That's a valid point. It<br>is still possible, to a degree, to buy your kids' way into top<br>colleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the<br>college admissions process.<br>According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education<br>Statistics, about 1.7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian<br>schools. At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such<br>schools. (Interestingly, the number at Harvard is significantly<br>lower, about 28%.) Obviously this is a huge loophole. It does at<br>least seem to be closing, not widening.<br>Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson<br>from the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming<br>that their system can't be hacked, measure the degree to which it<br>is. |
