| ![Cities and Ambition](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/cities-and-ambition-2.gif)<br>May 2008<br>Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you<br>walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a<br>message: you could do more; you should try harder.<br>The surprising thing is how different these messages can be. New<br>York tells you, above all: you should make more money. There are<br>other messages too, of course. You should be hipper. You should<br>be better looking. But the clearest message is that you should be<br>richer.<br>What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message<br>there is: you should be smarter. You really should get around to<br>reading all those books you've been meaning to.<br>When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising<br>answers. As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the<br>message the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful.<br>That's not quite the same message New York sends. Power matters<br>in New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a<br>billion dollars even if you merely inherited it. In Silicon Valley<br>no one would care except a few real estate agents. What matters<br>in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world. The<br>reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealth<br>but the fact that they control Google, which affects practically<br>everyone.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>How much does it matter what message a city sends? Empirically,<br>the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had<br>enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend<br>your environment. Where you live should make at most a couple<br>percent difference. But if you look at the historical evidence,<br>it seems to matter more than that. Most people who did great things<br>were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was<br>done at the time.<br>You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about<br>[earlier](https://paulgraham.com/taste.html): the case of the Milanese Leonardo. <br>Practically every<br>fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence,<br>even though Milan was just as big. People in Florence weren't<br>genetically different, so you have to assume there was someone born<br>in Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo. What happened<br>to him?<br>If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardo<br>couldn't beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can?<br>I don't. I'm fairly stubborn, but I wouldn't try to fight this<br>force. I'd rather use it. So I've thought a lot about where to<br>live.<br>I'd always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place — that<br>it would basically be Cambridge with good weather. But when I<br>finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not<br>to be. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better. Life<br>in Berkeley is very civilized. It's probably the place in America<br>where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home. But<br>it's not humming with ambition.<br>In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that a place so<br>pleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of<br>life. Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge.<br>The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident. You<br>have to make sacrifices to live there. It's expensive and somewhat<br>grubby, and the weather's often bad. So the kind of people you<br>find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the<br>smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive,<br>grubby place with bad weather.<br>As of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capital<br>of the world. I realize that seems a preposterous claim. What<br>makes it true is that it's more preposterous to claim about anywhere<br>else. American universities currently seem to be the best, judging<br>from the flow of ambitious students. And what US city has a stronger<br>claim? New York? A fair number of smart people, but diluted by a<br>much larger number of neanderthals in suits. The Bay Area has a<br>lot of smart people too, but again, diluted; there are two great<br>universities, but they're far apart. Harvard and MIT are practically<br>adjacent by West Coast standards, and they're surrounded by about<br>20 other colleges and universities.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f1n)\]<br>Cambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry is<br>ideas, while New York's is finance and Silicon Valley's is startups.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>When you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you're really<br>talking about is collections of people. For a long time cities<br>were the only large collections of people, so you could use the two<br>ideas interchangeably. But we can see how much things are changing<br>from the examples I've mentioned. New York is a classic great city.<br>But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is not<br>even that. (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capital<br>of Silicon Valley. It's just 178 square miles at one end of it.)<br>Maybe the Internet will change things further. Maybe one day the<br>most important community you belong to will be a virtual one, and<br>it won't matter where you live physically. But I wouldn't bet on<br>it. The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some of the<br>ways cities send you messages are quite subtle.<br>One of the exhilarating things about coming back to Cambridge every<br>spring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you can see<br>into the houses. When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening,<br>you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs. In Cambridge you see<br>shelves full of promising-looking books. Palo Alto was probably<br>much like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never guess now that there<br>was a university nearby. Now it's just one of the richer neighborhoods<br>in Silicon Valley. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f2n)\]<br>A city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you see<br>through windows, in conversations you overhear. It's not something<br>you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off. One of the<br>occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the<br>conversations of people who use interrogative intonation in declarative<br>sentences. But on average I'll take Cambridge conversations over<br>New York or Silicon Valley ones.<br>A friend who moved to Silicon Valley in the late 90s said the worst<br>thing about living there was the low quality of the eavesdropping.<br>At the time I thought she was being deliberately eccentric. Sure,<br>it can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is good quality<br>eavesdropping so important that it would affect where you chose to<br>live? Now I understand what she meant. The conversations you<br>overhear tell you what sort of people you're among.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>No matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be influenced<br>by the people around you. It's not so much that you do whatever a<br>city expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no one around<br>you cares about the same things you do.<br>There's an imbalance between encouragement and discouragement like<br>that between gaining and losing money. Most people overvalue<br>negative amounts of money: they'll work much harder to avoid losing<br>a dollar than to gain one. Similarly, although there are plenty of<br>people strong enough to resist doing something just because that's<br>what one is supposed to do where they happen to be, there are few<br>strong enough to keep working on something no one around them cares<br>about.<br>Because ambitions are to some extent incompatible and admiration<br>is a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type of ambition.<br>The reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is not just that<br>there's a concentration of smart people there, but that there's<br>nothing _else_ people there care about more. Professors in<br>New York and the Bay area are second class citizens — till they<br>start hedge funds or startups respectively.<br>This suggests an answer to a question people in New York have<br>wondered about since the Bubble: whether New York could grow into<br>a startup hub to rival Silicon Valley. One reason that's unlikely<br>is that someone starting a startup in New York would feel like a<br>second class citizen. <br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f3n)\]<br>There's already something else people in New York admire more.<br>In the long term, that could be a bad thing for New York. The power<br>of an important new technology does eventually convert to money.<br>So by caring more about money and less about power than Silicon<br>Valley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but slower.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f4n)\]<br>And in fact it has been losing to Silicon Valley at its own game:<br>the ratio of New York to California residents in the Forbes 400 has<br>decreased from 1.45 (81:56) when the list was first published in<br>1982 to .83 (73:88) in 2007.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>Not all cities send a message. Only those that are centers for<br>some type of ambition do. And it can be hard to tell exactly what<br>message a city sends without living there. I understand the messages<br>of New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I've lived for<br>several years in each of them. DC and LA seem to send messages<br>too, but I haven't spent long enough in either to say for sure what<br>they are.<br>The big thing in LA seems to be fame. There's an A List of people<br>who are most in demand right now, and what's most admired is to be<br>on it, or friends with those who are. Beneath that, the message is<br>much like New York's, though perhaps with more emphasis on physical<br>attractiveness.<br>In DC the message seems to be that the most important thing is who<br>you know. You want to be an insider. In practice this seems to<br>work much as in LA. There's an A List and you want to be on it or<br>close to those who are. The only difference is how the A List is<br>selected. And even that is not that different.<br>At the moment, San Francisco's message seems to be the same as<br>Berkeley's: you should live better. But this will change if enough<br>startups choose SF over the Valley. During the Bubble that was a<br>predictor of failure — a self-indulgent choice, like buying<br>expensive office furniture. Even now I'm suspicious when startups<br>choose SF. But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self-indulgent<br>choice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shift<br>there.<br>I haven't found anything like Cambridge for intellectual ambition.<br>Oxford and Cambridge (England) feel like Ithaca or Hanover: the<br>message is there, but not as strong.<br>Paris was once a great intellectual center. If you went there in<br>1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now. But I<br>tried living there for a bit last year, and the ambitions of the<br>inhabitants are not intellectual ones. The message Paris sends now<br>is: do things with style. I liked that, actually. Paris is the<br>only city I've lived in where people genuinely cared about art. In<br>America only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more<br>sophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name of<br>the artist. But looking through windows at dusk in Paris you can<br>see that people there actually care what paintings look like.<br>Visually, Paris has the best eavesdropping I know. <br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f5n)\]<br>There's one more message I've heard from cities: in London you can<br>still (barely) hear the message that one should be more aristocratic.<br>If you listen for it you can also hear it in Paris, New York, and<br>Boston. But this message is everywhere very faint. It would have<br>been strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn't have picked<br>it up at all if I hadn't deliberately tuned in to that wavelength<br>to see if there was any signal left.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>So far the complete list of messages I've picked up from cities is:<br>wealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame, political<br>power, economic power, intelligence, social class, and quality of<br>life.<br>My immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightly<br>queasy. I'd always considered ambition a good thing, but I realize<br>now that was because I'd always implicitly understood it to mean<br>ambition in the areas I cared about. When you list everything<br>ambitious people are ambitious about, it's not so pretty.<br>On closer examination I see a couple things on the list that are<br>surprising in the light of history. For example, physical<br>attractiveness wouldn't have been there 100 years ago (though it<br>might have been 2400 years ago). It has always mattered for women,<br>but in the late twentieth century it seems to have started to matter<br>for men as well. I'm not sure why — probably some combination<br>of the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actors<br>as models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now:<br>you can't show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory,<br>so you have to show off with your body instead.<br>Hipness is another thing you wouldn't have seen on the list 100<br>years ago. Or wouldn't you? What it means is to know what's what.<br>So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that<br>consisted of being "au fait." That could explain why hipness seems<br>particularly admired in London: it's version 2 of the traditional<br>English delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand.<br>Economic power would have been on the list 100 years ago, but what<br>we mean by it is changing. It used to mean the control of vast<br>human and material resources. But increasingly it means the ability<br>to direct the course of technology, and some of the people in a<br>position to do that are not even rich — leaders of important<br>open source projects, for example. The Captains of Industry of<br>times past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up new<br>technologies for them. The new breed are themselves those people.<br>As this force gets more attention, another is dropping off the list:<br>social class. I think the two changes are related. Economic power,<br>wealth, and social class are just names for the same thing at<br>different stages in its life: economic power converts to wealth,<br>and wealth to social class. So the focus of admiration is simply<br>shifting upstream.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>Does anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city?<br>No; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but they aren't<br>the only places that do. For some kinds of work, all you need is<br>a handful of talented colleagues.<br>What cities provide is an audience, and a funnel for peers. These<br>aren't so critical in something like math or physics, where no<br>audience matters except your peers, and judging ability is sufficiently<br>straightforward that hiring and admissions committees can do it<br>reliably. In a field like math or physics all you need is a<br>department with the right colleagues in it. It could be anywhere — in<br>Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example.<br>It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the<br>larger environment matters. In these the best practitioners aren't<br>conveniently collected in a few top university departments and<br>research labs — partly because talent is harder to judge, and<br>partly because people pay for these things, so one doesn't need to<br>rely on teaching or research funding to support oneself. It's in<br>these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city:<br>you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care<br>about the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for<br>yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city.<br>You don't have to live in a great city your whole life to benefit<br>from it. The critical years seem to be the early and middle ones<br>of your career. Clearly you don't have to grow up in a great city.<br>Nor does it seem to matter if you go to college in one. To most<br>college students a world of a few thousand people seems big enough.<br>Plus in college you don't yet have to face the hardest kind of<br>work — discovering new problems to solve.<br>It's when you move on to the next and much harder step that it helps<br>most to be in a place where you can find peers and encouragement.<br>You seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you've found both.<br>The Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were born all<br>over France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and died all over<br>France, but what defined them were the years they spent together<br>in Paris.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>Unless you're sure what you want to do and where the leading center<br>for it is, your best bet is probably to try living in several<br>places when you're young. You can never tell what message a city<br>sends till you live there, or even whether it still sends one.<br>Often your information will be wrong: I tried living in Florence<br>when I was 25, thinking it would be an art center, but it turned<br>out I was 450 years too late.<br>Even when a city is still a live center of ambition, you won't know<br>for sure whether its message will resonate with you till you hear<br>it. When I moved to New York, I was very excited at first. It's<br>an exciting place. So it took me quite a while to realize I just<br>wasn't like the people there. I kept searching for the Cambridge<br>of New York. It turned out it was way, way uptown: an hour uptown<br>by air.<br>Some people know at 16 what sort of work they're going to do, but<br>in most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specific<br>to be ambitious about. They know they want to do something great.<br>They just haven't decided yet whether they're going to be a rock<br>star or a brain surgeon. There's nothing wrong with that. But it<br>means if you have this most common type of ambition, you'll probably<br>have to figure out where to live by trial and error. You'll<br>probably have to find the city where you feel at home to know what sort of<br>ambition you have.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>This is one of the advantages of not having the universities<br>in your country controlled by the government. When governments<br>decide how to allocate resources, political deal-making causes<br>things to be spread out geographically. No central goverment would<br>put its two best universities in the same town, unless it was the<br>capital (which would cause other problems). But scholars seem to<br>like to cluster together as much as people in any other field, and<br>when given the freedom to they derive the same advantages from it.<br>\[2\]<br>There are still a few old professors in Palo Alto, but one by<br>one they die and their houses are transformed by developers into<br>McMansions and sold to VPs of Bus Dev.<br>\[3\]<br>How many times have you read about startup founders who continued<br>to live inexpensively as their companies took off? Who continued<br>to dress in jeans and t-shirts, to drive the old car they had in<br>grad school, and so on? If you did that in New York, people would<br>treat you like shit. If you walk into a fancy restaurant in San<br>Francisco wearing a jeans and a t-shirt, they're nice to you; who<br>knows who you might be? Not in New York.<br>One sign of a city's potential as a technology center is the number<br>of restaurants that still require jackets for men. According to<br>Zagat's there are none in San Francisco, LA, Boston, or Seattle, <br>4 in DC, 6 in Chicago, 8 in London, 13 in New York, and 20 in Paris.<br>(Zagat's lists the Ritz Carlton Dining Room in SF as requiring jackets<br>but I couldn't believe it, so I called to check and in fact they<br>don't. Apparently there's only one restaurant left on the entire West<br>Coast that still requires jackets: The French Laundry in Napa Valley.)<br>\[4\]<br>Ideas are one step upstream from economic power, so it's<br>conceivable that intellectual centers like Cambridge will one day<br>have an edge over Silicon Valley like the one the Valley has over<br>New York.<br>This seems unlikely at the moment; if anything Boston is falling<br>further and further behind. The only reason I even mention the<br>possibility is that the path from ideas to startups has recently<br>been getting smoother. It's a lot easier now for a couple of hackers<br>with no business experience to start a startup than it was 10 years<br>ago. If you extrapolate another 20 years, maybe the balance of<br>power will start to shift back. I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't<br>bet against it either.<br>\[5\]<br>If Paris is where people care most about art, why is New York<br>the center of gravity of the art business? Because in the twentieth<br>century, art as brand split apart from art as stuff. New York is<br>where the richest buyers are, but all they demand from art is brand,<br>and since you can base brand on anything with a sufficiently<br>identifiable style, you may as well use the local stuff.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,<br>Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, and David Sloo for reading drafts<br>of this. |
