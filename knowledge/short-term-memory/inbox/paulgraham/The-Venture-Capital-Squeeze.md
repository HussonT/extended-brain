| ![The Venture Capital Squeeze](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-venture-capital-squeeze-2.gif)<br>November 2005<br>In the next few years, venture capital funds will find themselves<br>squeezed from four directions. They're already stuck with a seller's<br>market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the<br>Bubble and still haven't invested. This by itself is not the end<br>of the world. In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the<br>[norm](http://www.archub.org/dilbertvc.gif)<br>in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.<br>Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because<br>it's getting so cheap to start a startup. The four causes: open<br>source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware<br>geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free<br>if you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot<br>cheaper.<br>When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest<br>expenses. We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,<br>the only software that then supported secure http connections. We<br>paid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of<br>memory. And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.<br>Now you could get all three for nothing. You can get the software<br>for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first<br>server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times<br>as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got<br>through the print media.<br>And of course another big change for the average startup is that<br>programming languages have improved-- or rather, the [median language](https://paulgraham.com/avg.html) has. At most startups ten years<br>ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in<br>C++. Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python<br>or Ruby.<br>During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would<br>outsource their development to India. I think a better model for<br>the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development<br>to a more powerful language instead. A lot of well-known applications<br>are now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer. And one<br>guy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste<br>any time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can<br>pay himself nothing.<br>Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now<br>often want to give startups more money than the startups want to<br>take. VCs like to invest several million at a time. But as one<br>VC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a<br>million, "I don't know what we're going to do. Maybe we'll just<br>have to give some of it back." Meaning give some of the fund back<br>to the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't<br>going to be possible to invest it all.<br>Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.<br>Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically<br>increases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition<br>to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a<br>year, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate<br>officers. An experienced CFO I know said flatly: "I would not<br>want to be CFO of a public company now."<br>You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area<br>where you can't go too far. But you can go too far in any law, and<br>this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have. This CFO<br>is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know. If<br>Sarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public <br>companies, that's proof enough that it's broken.<br>Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now. For<br>all practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought. Which<br>means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3<br>man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100<br>million to acquire. They didn't mean to be in this business; it's<br>just what their business has evolved into.<br>Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they<br>can buy wholesale. Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups<br>they want more expensive? Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't<br>want anyway. The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR<br>departments. What they really want is the software and the developers,<br>and that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated<br>software and developers.<br>Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.<br>"Bring us your startups early," said Google's speaker at the [Startup School](http://startupschool.org/). They're quite<br>explicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point<br>where they would do a Series A round. (The Series A round is the<br>first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first<br>year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology<br>companies will no doubt try to duplicate. Unless they want to have <br>still more of their lunch eaten by Google.<br>Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the<br>people there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.<br>Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;<br>it's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich<br>when you're still working for salary. Even if it's the right thing <br>for your company to do.<br>**The Solution(s)**<br>Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.<br>They need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and <br>another that will seem an anathema.<br>Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley <br>loosened. This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to<br>destroy the IPO market. Since the IPO market was practically dead<br>when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have. But now <br>that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly<br>what a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.<br>Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact. These seedlings<br>are worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the<br>economy. Much of the economy's growth is their growth. I think<br>most politicians realize that. But they don't realize just how <br>fragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral<br>damage of laws meant to fix some other problem.<br>Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very<br>little noise. If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll<br>hear about it. But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,<br>all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in <br>grad school instead of starting a company.<br>My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash <br>out partially in the Series A round. At the moment, when VCs invest<br>in a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the <br>money goes to the company. They could buy some stock directly from<br>the founders as well.<br>Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this. They<br>don't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes<br>public. VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll<br>have less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.<br>This is a dumb plan. In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock<br>early would generally be better for the company, because it would<br>cause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the<br>VCs'. As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend<br>to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would<br>prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,<br>while the VCs can afford to be "rational" and prefer the latter.<br>Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies<br>early instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up<br>front. That first million is just worth so much more than the<br>subsequent ones. If founders could sell a little stock early,<br>they'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger<br>outcome.<br>So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least<br>half million? The VCs would get same number of shares for the <br>money. So what if some of the money would go to the <br>founders instead of the company?<br>Some VCs will say this is<br>unthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work<br>growing the company. But the fact is, the huge size of current VC<br>investments is dictated by the [structure](https://paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html)<br>of VC funds, not the needs of startups. Often as not these large <br>investments go to work destroying the company rather than growing<br>it.<br>The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell<br>some stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. <br>The angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.<br>And for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness<br>of a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a<br>motivator.<br>If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially<br>cash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you<br>are now competing directly with Google.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica<br>Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. |
