| ![How to Work Hard](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-work-hard-4.gif)<br>June 2021<br>It might not seem there's much to learn about how to work hard.<br>Anyone who's been to school knows what it entails, even if they<br>chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And<br>yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I<br>was in school, the answer is definitely yes.<br>One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you'll<br>have to work very hard. I wasn't sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork<br>varied in difficulty; one didn't always have to work super hard to<br>do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to<br>do almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard<br>work through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.<br>There isn't.<br>The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low<br>standards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do things<br>effortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy.<br>Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability<br>too. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,<br>practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to<br>do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability<br>_and_ to have practiced a lot _and_ to be trying very hard. <br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f1n)\]<br>Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business<br>in his era, but he was also among the hardest working. "I never<br>took a day off in my twenties," he said. "Not one." It was similar<br>with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth<br>coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but<br>his dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probably<br>get my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I had<br>to choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no one<br>ever worked harder. At 74, he wrote<br>> with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that<br>>  this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A<br>>  good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one's toes and<br>>  makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases<br>>  twenty times.<br>Sounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds even<br>more extreme. Not one day off in ten years? These two had about<br>as much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they also<br>worked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both.<br>That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hard<br>to grasp. There's a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comes<br>partly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, and<br>partly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talent<br>and great drive are both rare, then people with both are rare<br>squared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have less<br>of the other. But you'll need both if you want to be an outlier<br>yourself. And since you can't really change how much natural talent<br>you have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces<br>to working very hard.<br>It's straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,<br>externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some technique<br>to it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate<br>(which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and<br>not to give up when things go wrong. But this level of discipline<br>seems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they want<br>it.<br>What I've learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goals<br>that are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You'll<br>probably have to learn both if you want to do really great things.<br>The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working<br>without anyone telling you to. Now, when I'm not working hard, alarm<br>bells go off. I can't be sure I'm getting anywhere when I'm working<br>hard, but I can be sure I'm getting nowhere when I'm not, and it<br>feels awful.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f2n)\]<br>There wasn't a single point when I learned this. Like most little<br>kids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or did<br>something new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling of<br>disgust when I wasn't achieving anything. The one precisely dateable<br>landmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age 13.<br>Several people I've talked to remember getting serious about work<br>around this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started to<br>find idleness distasteful, he said<br>> I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around<br>>  then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering<br>>  why I was wasting my summer holiday.<br>Perhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense.<br>Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious about<br>work was probably school, which made work (what they called work)<br>seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was before<br>I could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, because<br>even in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entire<br>departments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of real<br>work, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they'd<br>been made for each other.<br>I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can<br>love it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in _A Mathematician's_<br>_Apology_:<br>> I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any _passion_ for<br>>  mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of<br>>  a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in<br>>  terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other<br>>  boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most<br>>  decisively.<br>He didn't learn what math was really about till part way through<br>college, when he read Jordan's _Cours d'analyse_.<br>> I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that<br>>  remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians<br>>  of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what<br>>  mathematics really meant.<br>There are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn to<br>discount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kind<br>Hardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they're<br>adapted to be taught to kids — often so distorted that they're<br>nothing like the work done by actual practitioners.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f3n)\]<br>The other<br>kind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some types<br>of work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork.<br>There's a kind of solidity to real work. It's not all writing the<br>_Principia_, but it all feels necessary. That's a vague criterion,<br>but it's deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot of<br>different types.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f4n)\]<br>Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how many<br>hours a day to spend on it. You can't solve this problem by simply<br>working every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there's a<br>point beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.<br>That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.<br>I've done several different kinds of work, and the limits were<br>different for each. My limit for the harder types of writing or<br>programming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was running<br>a startup, I could<br>work all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I'd<br>kept going much longer, I'd probably have needed to take occasional<br>vacations.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f5n)\]<br>The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a<br>sensitivity to the quality of the work you're doing, and then you'll<br>notice if it decreases because you're working too hard. Honesty is<br>critical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you're<br>being lazy, but also when you're working too hard. And if you think<br>there's something admirable about working too hard, get that idea<br>out of your head. You're not merely getting worse results, but<br>getting them because you're showing off — if not to other people,<br>then to yourself.<br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f6n)\]<br>Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process,<br>not something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work and<br>your ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to be<br>constantly judging both how hard you're trying and how well you're<br>doing.<br>Trying hard doesn't mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though.<br>There may be some people who do, but I think my experience is fairly<br>typical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I'm<br>starting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That's<br>when I'm in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, I<br>tend to keep going.<br>What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was working<br>on Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinated<br>at all then, because there was always something that needed doing,<br>and if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beast<br>by doing it, why wait? \[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f7n)\]<br>Whereas what drives me now, writing<br>essays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days,<br>like a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. But<br>once I get started on one, I don't have to push myself to work,<br>because there's always some error or omission already pushing me.<br>I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Many<br>problems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuff<br>at the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to the<br>extent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you'll<br>only be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you should<br>always be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling.<br>The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of these<br>problems with a hard core. There are important problems at the<br>center, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones at<br>the edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved in<br>working on a specific problem, you'll occasionally have to make<br>big, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.<br>And the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward the<br>center — toward the most ambitious problems.<br>By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the current<br>consensus about the center. The consensus about which problems are<br>most important is often mistaken, both in general and within specific<br>fields. If you disagree with it, and you're right, that could<br>represent a valuable opportunity to do something new.<br>The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but although<br>you should not be in denial about this, neither should you treat<br>difficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If you<br>discover some ambitious type of work that's a bargain in the sense<br>of being easier for you than other people, either because of the<br>abilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you've<br>found to approach it, or simply because you're more excited about<br>it, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done by<br>people who find an easy way to do something hard.<br>As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure out<br>which kind you're suited for. And that doesn't just mean figuring<br>out which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn't<br>mean that if you're 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. What<br>you're suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps even<br>more on your interests. A [deep interest](https://paulgraham.com/genius.html) <br>in a topic makes people<br>work harder than any amount of discipline can.<br>It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents.<br>There are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start to<br>be judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is a<br>subtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later.<br>The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerful<br>sources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you really<br>interested in x, or do you want to work on it because you'll make<br>a lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you,<br>or because your parents want you to?<br>\[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f8n)\]<br>The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously<br>from one person to another. That's one of the most important things<br>I've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the<br>impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is<br>figure out what it is. That's how it works in movies, and in the<br>streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way<br>in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and<br>just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly<br>from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify<br>one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math<br>and physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an<br>[illusion](https://paulgraham.com/disc.html) induced by hindsight bias. <br>There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.<br>So while some people's lives converge fast, there will be others<br>whose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out what<br>to work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoing<br>part of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For these<br>people, the process I described earlier has a third component: along<br>with measuring both how hard you're working and how well you're<br>doing, you have to think about whether you should keep working in<br>this field or switch to another. If you're working hard but not<br>getting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simple<br>expressed that way, but in practice it's very difficult. You shouldn't<br>give up on the first day just because you work hard and don't get<br>anywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how much<br>time? And what should you do if work that was going well stops going<br>well? How much time do you give yourself then?<br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f9n)\]<br>What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide.<br>If you're exploring an area few others have worked in, you may not<br>even know what good results look like. History is full of examples<br>of people who misjudged the importance of what they were working<br>on.<br>The best test of whether it's worthwhile to work on something is<br>whether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerously<br>subjective measure, but it's probably the most accurate one you're<br>going to get. You're the one working on the stuff. Who's in a better<br>position than you to judge whether it's important, and what's a<br>better predictor of its importance than whether it's interesting?<br>For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself.<br>Indeed, that's the most striking thing about the whole question of<br>working hard: how at each point it depends on being honest with<br>yourself.<br>Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated,<br>dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You<br>have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind<br>you're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you<br>can, accurately judge at each moment both what you're capable of<br>and how you're doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can<br>without harming the quality of the result. This network is too<br>complicated to trick. But if you're consistently honest and<br>clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and<br>you'll be productive in a way few people are.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>In "The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius" I said the three ingredients<br>in great work were natural ability, determination, and interest.<br>That's the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interest<br>yield practice and effort.<br>\[2\]<br>I mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You'll often<br>get somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution to<br>a problem comes to you while taking a <br>[shower](https://paulgraham.com/top.html), or even in your sleep,<br>but only because you were working hard on it the day before.<br>It's good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation,<br>I like to learn new things. I wouldn't like just sitting on a beach.<br>\[3\]<br>The thing kids do in school that's most like the real version<br>is sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games played<br>in schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactly<br>what adults do.<br>In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretending<br>to do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend.<br>Arguably the latter is no worse.<br>\[4\]<br>Knowing what you want to work on doesn't mean you'll be able<br>to. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on things<br>they don't want to, especially early on. But if you know what you<br>want to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in.<br>\[5\]<br>The lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution to<br>the problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switch<br>to harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately.<br>\[6\]<br>Some cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. I<br>don't love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of something<br>important and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doing<br>things that don't matter. I don't know enough to say for sure whether<br>it's net good or bad, but my guess is bad.<br>\[7\]<br>One of the reasons people work so hard on startups is that<br>startups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be both<br>decisive and conspicuous.<br>\[8\]<br>It's ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You need<br>to solve the money problem somehow, and there's nothing wrong with<br>doing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I suppose<br>it would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake;<br>whatever floats your boat. Just so long as you're conscious of your<br>motivations. The thing to avoid is _unconsciously_ letting the need<br>for money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find most<br>interesting.<br>\[9\]<br>Many people face this question on a smaller scale with<br>individual projects. But it's easier both to recognize and to accept<br>a dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of work<br>entirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like a<br>Spanish Flu victim, you're fighting your own immune system: Instead<br>of giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And who<br>can say you're not right?<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, John Carmack, John Collison, Patrick Collison,<br>Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this. |
