| ![Why Startups Condense in America](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/why-startups-condense-in-america-2.gif)<br>May 2006<br>_(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)_<br>Startups happen in clusters. There are a lot of them in Silicon<br>Valley and Boston, and few in Chicago or Miami. A country that<br>wants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever makes<br>these clusters form.<br>I've claimed that the [recipe](https://paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html) is a<br>great university near a town smart<br>people like. If you set up those conditions within the US, startups<br>will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold piece<br>of metal. But when I consider what it would take to reproduce<br>Silicon Valley in another country, it's clear the US is a particularly<br>humid environment. Startups condense more easily here.<br>It is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valley<br>in another country. There's room not merely to equal Silicon Valley,<br>but to surpass it. But if you want to do that, you have to<br>understand the advantages startups get from being in America.<br>**1\. The US Allows Immigration.**<br>For example, I doubt it would be possible to reproduce Silicon<br>Valley in Japan, because one of Silicon Valley's most distinctive<br>features is immigration. Half the people there speak with accents.<br>And the Japanese don't like immigration. When they think about how<br>to make a Japanese silicon valley, I suspect they unconsciously<br>frame it as how to make one consisting only of Japanese people.<br>This way of framing the question probably guarantees failure.<br>A silicon valley has to be a mecca for the smart and the ambitious,<br>and you can't have a mecca if you don't let people into it.<br>Of course, it's not saying much that America is more open to<br>immigration than Japan. Immigration policy is one area where a<br>competitor could do better.<br>**2\. The US Is a Rich Country.**<br>I could see India one day producing a rival to Silicon Valley.<br>Obviously they have the right people: you can tell that by the<br>number of Indians in the current Silicon Valley. The problem with<br>India itself is that it's still so poor.<br>In poor countries, things we take for granted are missing. A friend<br>of mine visiting India sprained her ankle falling down the steps<br>in a railway station. When she turned to see what had happened,<br>she found the steps were all different heights. In industrialized<br>countries we walk down steps our whole lives and never think about<br>this, because there's an infrastructure that prevents such a staircase<br>from being built.<br>The US has never been so poor as some countries are now. There<br>have never been swarms of beggars in the streets of American cities.<br>So we have no data about what it takes to get from the swarms-of-beggars<br>stage to the silicon-valley stage. Could you have both at once,<br>or does there have to be some baseline prosperity before you get a<br>silicon valley?<br>I suspect there is some speed limit to the evolution<br>of an economy. Economies are made out of people, and attitudes can<br>only change a certain amount per generation.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f1n)\]<br>**3\. The US Is Not (Yet) a Police State.**<br>Another country I could see wanting to have a silicon valley is<br>China. But I doubt they could do it yet either. China still seems<br>to be a police state, and although present rulers seem enlightened<br>compared to the last, even enlightened despotism can probably only<br>get you part way toward being a great economic power.<br>It can get you factories for building things designed elsewhere.<br>Can it get you the designers, though? Can imagination flourish<br>where people can't criticize the government? Imagination means<br>having odd ideas, and it's hard to have odd ideas about technology<br>without also having odd ideas about politics. And in any case,<br>many technical ideas do have political implications. So if you<br>squash dissent, the back pressure will propagate into technical<br>fields. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f2n)\]<br>Singapore would face a similar problem. Singapore seems very aware<br>of the importance of encouraging startups. But while energetic<br>government intervention may be able to make a port run efficiently,<br>it can't coax startups into existence. A state that bans chewing<br>gum has a long way to go before it could create a San Francisco.<br>Do you need a San Francisco? Might there not be an alternate route<br>to innovation that goes through obedience and cooperation instead<br>of individualism? Possibly, but I'd bet not. Most imaginative<br>people seem to share a certain prickly [independence](https://paulgraham.com/gba.html),<br>whenever and wherever they lived. You see it in Diogenes telling<br>Alexander to get out of his light and two thousand years later in<br>Feynman breaking into safes at Los Alamos.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f3n)\]<br>Imaginative people<br>don't want to follow or lead. They're most productive when everyone<br>gets to do what they want.<br>Ironically, of all rich countries the US has lost the most civil<br>liberties recently. But I'm not too worried yet. I'm hoping once<br>the present administration is out, the natural openness of American<br>culture will reassert itself.<br>**4\. American Universities Are Better.**<br>You need a great university to seed a silicon valley, and so far<br>there are few outside the US. I asked a handful of American computer<br>science professors which universities in Europe were most admired,<br>and they all basically said "Cambridge" followed by a long pause<br>while they tried to think of others. There don't seem to be many<br>universities elsewhere that compare with the best in America, at<br>least in technology.<br>In some countries this is the result of a deliberate policy. The<br>German and Dutch governments, perhaps from fear of elitism, try to<br>ensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality. The<br>downside is that none are especially good. The best professors<br>are spread out, instead of being concentrated as they are in the<br>US. This probably makes them less productive, because they don't<br>have good colleagues to inspire them. It also means no one university<br>will be good enough to act as a mecca, attracting talent from abroad<br>and causing startups to form around it.<br>The case of Germany is a strange one. The Germans invented the<br>modern university, and up till the 1930s theirs were the best in<br>the world. Now they have none that stand out. As I was mulling<br>this over, I found myself thinking: "I can understand why German<br>universities declined in the 1930s, after they excluded Jews. But<br>surely they should have bounced back by now." Then I realized:<br>maybe not. There are few Jews left in Germany and most Jews I know<br>would not want to move there. And if you took any great American<br>university and removed the Jews, you'd have some pretty big gaps.<br>So maybe it would be a lost cause trying to create a silicon valley<br>in Germany, because you couldn't establish the level of university<br>you'd need as a seed.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f4n)\]<br>It's natural for US universities to compete with one another because<br>so many are private. To reproduce the quality of American universities<br>you probably also have to reproduce this. If universities are<br>controlled by the central government, log-rolling will pull them<br>all toward the mean: the new Institute of X will end up at the<br>university in the district of a powerful politician, instead of<br>where it should be.<br>**5\. You Can Fire People in America.**<br>I think one of the biggest obstacles to creating startups in Europe<br>is the attitude toward employment. The famously rigid labor laws<br>hurt every company, but startups especially, because startups have<br>the least time to spare for bureaucratic hassles.<br>The difficulty of firing people is a particular problem for startups<br>because they have no redundancy. Every person has to do their<br>job well.<br>But the problem is more than just that some startup might have a<br>problem firing someone they needed to. Across industries and<br>countries, there's a strong inverse correlation between performance<br>and job security. Actors and directors are fired at the end of<br>each film, so they have to deliver every time. Junior professors<br>are fired by default after a few years unless the university chooses<br>to grant them tenure. Professional athletes know they'll be pulled<br>if they play badly for just a couple games. At the other end of<br>the scale (at least in the US) are auto workers, New York City<br>schoolteachers, and civil servants, who are all nearly impossible<br>to fire. The trend is so clear that you'd have to be willfully<br>blind not to see it.<br>Performance isn't everything, you say? Well, are auto workers,<br>schoolteachers, and civil servants _happier_ than actors,<br>professors, and professional athletes?<br>European public opinion will apparently tolerate people being fired<br>in industries where they really care about performance. Unfortunately<br>the only industry they care enough about so far is soccer. But<br>that is at least a precedent.<br>**6\. In America Work Is Less Identified with Employment.**<br>The problem in more traditional places like Europe and Japan goes<br>deeper than the employment laws. More dangerous is the attitude<br>they reflect: that an employee is a kind of servant, whom the<br>employer has a duty to protect. It used to be that way in America<br>too. In 1970 you were still supposed to get a job with a big<br>company, for whom ideally you'd work your whole career. In return<br>the company would take care of you: they'd try not to fire you,<br>cover your medical expenses, and support you in old age.<br>Gradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtones<br>and becoming simply an economic exchange. But the importance of<br>the new model is not just that it makes it easier for startups to<br>grow. More important, I think, is that it it makes it easier for<br>people to _start_ startups.<br>Even in the US most kids graduating from college still think they're<br>supposed to get jobs, as if you couldn't be productive without being<br>someone's employee. But the less you identify work with employment,<br>the easier it becomes to start a startup. When you see your career<br>as a series of different types of work, instead of a lifetime's<br>service to a single employer, there's less risk in starting your<br>own company, because you're only replacing one segment instead of<br>discarding the whole thing.<br>The old ideas are so powerful that even the most successful startup<br>founders have had to struggle against them. A year after the<br>founding of Apple, Steve Wozniak still hadn't quit HP. He still<br>planned to work there for life. And when Jobs found someone to<br>give Apple serious venture funding, on the condition that Woz quit,<br>he initially refused, arguing that he'd designed both the Apple I<br>and the Apple II while working at HP, and there was no reason he<br>couldn't continue.<br>**7\. America Is Not Too Fussy.**<br>If there are any laws regulating businesses, you can assume larval<br>startups will break most of them, because they don't know what the<br>laws are and don't have time to find out.<br>For example, many startups in America begin in places where it's<br>not really legal to run a business. Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and<br>Google were all run out of garages. Many more startups, including<br>ours, were initially run out of apartments. If the laws against<br>such things were actually enforced, most startups wouldn't happen.<br>That could be a problem in fussier countries. If Hewlett and Packard<br>tried running an electronics company out of their garage in<br>Switzerland, the old lady next door would report them to the municipal<br>authorities.<br>But the worst problem in other countries is probably the effort<br>required just to start a company. A friend of mine started a company<br>in Germany in the early 90s, and was shocked to discover, among<br>many other regulations, that you needed $20,000 in capital to<br>incorporate. That's one reason I'm not typing this on an Apfel<br>laptop. Jobs and Wozniak couldn't have come up with that kind of<br>money in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator.<br>We couldn't have started Viaweb either.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f5n)\]<br>Here's a tip for governments that want to encourage startups: read<br>the stories of existing startups, and then try to simulate what<br>would have happened in your country. When you hit something that<br>would have killed Apple, prune it off.<br>_Startups are [marginal](https://paulgraham.com/marginal.html)._ <br>They're started by the poor and the<br>timid; they begin in marginal space and spare time; they're started<br>by people who are supposed to be doing something else; and though<br>businesses, their founders often know nothing about business. Young<br>startups are fragile. A society that trims its margins sharply<br>will kill them all.<br>**8\. America Has a Large Domestic Market.**<br>What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting<br>their initial product out. The successful ones therefore make the<br>first version as simple as possible. In the US they usually begin<br>by making something just for the local market.<br>This works in America, because the local market is 300 million<br>people. It wouldn't work so well in Sweden. In a small country,<br>a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from<br>the start.<br>The EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domestic<br>market. The problem is that the inhabitants still speak many<br>different languages. So a software startup in Sweden is still at<br>a disadvantage relative to one in the US, because they have to deal<br>with internationalization from the beginning. It's significant<br>that the most famous recent startup in Europe, Skype, worked on a<br>problem that was intrinsically international.<br>However, for better or worse it looks as if Europe will in a few<br>decades speak a single language. When I was a student in Italy in<br>1990, few Italians spoke English. Now all educated people seem to<br>be expected to-- and Europeans do not like to seem uneducated. This<br>is presumably a taboo subject, but if present trends continue,<br>French and German will eventually go the way of Irish and Luxembourgish:<br>they'll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists.<br>**9\. America Has Venture Funding.**<br>Startups are easier to start in America because funding is easier<br>to get. There are now a few VC firms outside the US, but startup<br>funding doesn't only come from VC firms. A more important source,<br>because it's more personal and comes earlier in the process, is<br>money from individual angel investors. Google might never have got<br>to the point where they could raise millions from VC funds if they<br>hadn't first raised a hundred thousand from Andy Bechtolsheim. And<br>he could help them because he was one of the founders of Sun. This<br>pattern is repeated constantly in startup hubs. It's this pattern<br>that _makes_ them startup hubs.<br>The good news is, all you have to do to get the process rolling is<br>get those first few startups successfully launched. If they stick<br>around after they get rich, startup founders will almost automatically<br>fund and encourage new startups.<br>The bad news is that the cycle is slow. It probably takes five<br>years, on average, before a startup founder can make angel investments.<br>And while governments _might_ be able to set up local VC funds<br>by supplying the money themselves and recruiting people from existing<br>firms to run them, only organic growth can produce angel investors.<br>Incidentally, America's private universities are one reason there's<br>so much venture capital. A lot of the money in VC funds comes from<br>their endowments. So another advantage of private universities is<br>that a good chunk of the country's wealth is managed by enlightened<br>investors.<br>**10\. America Has Dynamic Typing for Careers.**<br>Compared to other industrialized countries the US is disorganized<br>about routing people into careers. For example, in America people<br>often don't decide to go to medical school till they've finished<br>college. In Europe they generally decide in high school.<br>The European approach reflects the old idea that each person has a<br>single, definite occupation-- which is not far from the idea that<br>each person has a natural "station" in life. If this were true,<br>the most efficient plan would be to discover each person's station<br>as early as possible, so they could receive the training appropriate<br>to it.<br>In the US things are more haphazard. But that turns out to be an<br>advantage as an economy gets more liquid, just as dynamic typing<br>turns out to work better than static for ill-defined problems. This<br>is particularly true with startups. "Startup founder" is not the<br>sort of career a high school student would choose. If you ask at<br>that age, people will choose conservatively. They'll choose<br>well-understood occupations like engineer, or doctor, or lawyer.<br>Startups are the kind of thing people don't plan, so you're more<br>likely to get them in a society where it's ok to make career decisions<br>on the fly.<br>For example, in theory the purpose of a PhD program is to train you<br>to do research. But fortunately in the US this is another rule<br>that isn't very strictly enforced. In the US most people in CS PhD<br>programs are there simply because they wanted to learn more. They<br>haven't decided what they'll do afterward. So American grad schools<br>spawn a lot of startups, because students don't feel they're failing<br>if they don't go into research.<br>Those worried about America's "competitiveness" often suggest<br>spending more on public schools. But perhaps America's lousy public<br>schools have a hidden advantage. Because they're so bad, the kids<br>adopt an attitude of waiting for college. I did; I knew I was<br>learning so little that I wasn't even learning what the choices<br>were, let alone which to choose. This is demoralizing, but it does<br>at least make you keep an open mind.<br>Certainly if I had to choose between bad high schools and good<br>universities, like the US, and good high schools and bad universities,<br>like most other industrialized countries, I'd take the US system.<br>Better to make everyone feel like a late bloomer than a failed child<br>prodigy.<br>**Attitudes**<br>There's one item conspicuously missing from this list: American<br>attitudes. Americans are said to be more entrepreneurial, and less<br>afraid of risk. But America has no monopoly on this. Indians and<br>Chinese seem plenty entrepreneurial, perhaps more than Americans.<br>Some say Europeans are less energetic, but I don't believe it. I<br>think the problem with Europe is not that they lack balls, but that<br>they lack examples.<br>Even in the US, the most successful startup founders are often<br>technical people who are quite timid, initially, about the idea of<br>starting their own company. Few are the sort of backslapping<br>extroverts one thinks of as typically American. They can usually<br>only summon up the activation energy to start a startup when they<br>meet people who've done it and realize they could too.<br>I think what holds back European hackers is simply that they don't<br>meet so many people who've done it. You see that variation even<br>within the US. Stanford students are more entrepreneurial than<br>Yale students, but not because of some difference in their characters;<br>the Yale students just have fewer examples.<br>I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in<br>Europe and the US. In the US it's ok to be overtly ambitious, and<br>in most of Europe it's not. But this can't be an intrinsically<br>European quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious<br>as Americans. What happened? My hypothesis is that ambition was<br>discredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the first<br>half of the twentieth century. Now swagger is out. (Even now the<br>image of a very ambitious German presses a button or two, doesn't<br>it?)<br>It would be surprising if European attitudes weren't affected by<br>the disasters of the twentieth century. It takes a while to be<br>optimistic after events like that. But ambition is human nature.<br>Gradually it will re-emerge.<br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f6n)\]<br>**How To Do Better**<br>I don't mean to suggest by this list that America is the perfect<br>place for startups. It's the best place so far, but the sample<br>size is small, and "so far" is not very long. On historical time <br>scales, what we have now is just a<br>prototype.<br>So let's look at Silicon Valley the way you'd look at a product<br>made by a competitor. What weaknesses could you exploit? How could<br>you make something users would like better? The users in this case<br>are those critical few thousand people you'd like to move to your<br>silicon valley.<br>To start with, Silicon Valley is too far from San Francisco. Palo<br>Alto, the original ground zero, is about thirty miles away, and the<br>present center more like forty. So people who come to work in<br>Silicon Valley face an unpleasant choice: either live in the boring<br>sprawl of the valley proper, or live in San Francisco and endure<br>an hour commute each way.<br>The best thing would be if the silicon valley were not merely closer<br>to the interesting city, but interesting itself. And there is a<br>lot of room for improvement here. Palo Alto is not so bad, but<br>everything built since is the worst sort of strip development. You<br>can measure how demoralizing it is by the number of people who will<br>sacrifice two hours a day commuting rather than live there.<br>Another area in which you could easily surpass Silicon Valley is<br>public transportation. There is a train running the length of it,<br>and by American standards it's not bad. Which is to say that to<br>Japanese or Europeans it would seem like something out of the third<br>world.<br>The kind of people you want to attract to your silicon valley like<br>to get around by train, bicycle, and on foot. So if you want to<br>beat America, design a town that puts cars last. It will be a while<br>before any American city can bring itself to do that.<br>**Capital Gains**<br>There are also a couple things you could do to beat America at the<br>national level. One would be to have lower capital gains taxes.<br>It doesn't seem critical to have the lowest _income_ taxes,<br>because to take advantage of those, people have to move.<br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f7n)\]<br>But<br>if capital gains rates vary, you move assets, not yourself, so<br>changes are reflected at market speeds. The lower the rate, the<br>cheaper it is to buy stock in growing companies as opposed to real<br>estate, or bonds, or stocks bought for the dividends they pay.<br>So if you want to encourage startups you should have a low rate on<br>capital gains. Politicians are caught between a rock and a hard<br>place here, however: make the capital gains rate low and be accused<br>of creating "tax breaks for the rich," or make it high and starve<br>growing companies of investment capital. As Galbraith said,<br>politics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable and the<br>disastrous. A lot of governments experimented with the disastrous<br>in the twentieth century; now the trend seems to be toward the<br>merely unpalatable.<br>Oddly enough, the leaders now are European countries like Belgium,<br>which has a capital gains tax rate of zero.<br>**Immigration**<br>The other place you could beat the US would be with smarter immigration<br>policy. There are huge gains to be made here. Silicon valleys are<br>made of people, remember.<br>Like a company whose software runs on Windows, those in the current<br>Silicon Valley are all too aware of the shortcomings of the INS,<br>but there's little they can do about it. They're hostages of the<br>platform.<br>America's immigration system has never been well run, and since<br>2001 there has been an additional admixture of paranoia. What<br>fraction of the smart people who want to come to America can even<br>get in? I doubt even half. Which means if you made a competing<br>technology hub that let in all smart people, you'd immediately get<br>more than half the world's top talent, for free.<br>US immigration policy is particularly ill-suited to startups, because<br>it reflects a model of work from the 1970s. It assumes good technical<br>people have college degrees, and that work means working for a big<br>company.<br>If you don't have a college degree you can't get an H1B visa, the<br>type usually issued to programmers. But a test that excludes Steve<br>Jobs, Bill Gates, and Michael Dell can't be a good one. Plus you<br>can't get a visa for working on your own company, only for working<br>as an employee of someone else's. And if you want to apply for<br>citizenship you daren't work for a startup at all, because if your<br>sponsor goes out of business, you have to start over.<br>American immigration policy keeps out most smart people, and channels<br>the rest into unproductive jobs. It would be easy to do better.<br>Imagine if, instead, you treated immigration like recruiting-- if<br>you made a conscious effort to seek out the smartest people and get<br>them to come to your country.<br>A country that got immigration right would have a huge advantage.<br>At this point you could become a mecca for smart people simply by<br>having an immigration system that let them in.<br>**A Good Vector**<br>If you look at the kinds of things you have to do to create an<br>environment where startups condense, none are great sacrifices.<br>Great universities? Livable towns? Civil liberties? Flexible<br>employment laws? Immigration policies that let in smart people?<br>Tax laws that encourage growth? It's not as if you have to risk<br>destroying your country to get a silicon valley; these are all good<br>things in their own right.<br>And then of course there's the question, can you afford not to? I<br>can imagine a future in which the default choice of ambitious young<br>people is to start their [own](https://paulgraham.com/hiring.html) company<br>rather than work for someone else's. I'm not sure that will happen,<br>but it's where the trend points now. And if that is the future,<br>places that don't have startups will be a whole step behind,<br>like those that missed the Industrial Revolution.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>On the verge of the Industrial Revolution, England was already<br>the richest country in the world. As far as such things can be<br>compared, per capita income in England in 1750 was higher than<br>India's in 1960.<br>Deane, Phyllis, _The First Industrial Revolution_, Cambridge<br>University Press, 1965.<br>\[2\]<br> This has already happened once in China, during the Ming<br>Dynasty, when the country turned its back on industrialization at<br>the command of the court. One of Europe's advantages was that it<br>had no government powerful enough to do that.<br>\[3\]<br>Of course, Feynman and Diogenes were from adjacent traditions,<br>but Confucius, though more polite, was no more willing to be told<br>what to think.<br>\[4\]<br>For similar reasons it might be a lost cause to try to establish<br>a silicon valley in Israel. Instead of no Jews moving there, only<br>Jews would move there, and I don't think you could build a silicon<br>valley out of just Jews any more than you could out of just Japanese.<br>(This is not a remark about the qualities of these groups, just their<br>sizes. Japanese are only about 2% of the world population, and<br>Jews about .2%.)<br>\[5\]<br>According to the World Bank, the initial capital requirement<br>for German companies is 47.6% of the per capita income. Doh.<br>World Bank, _Doing Business in 2006_, http://doingbusiness.org<br>\[6\]<br>For most of the twentieth century, Europeans looked back on<br>the summer of 1914 as if they'd been living in a dream world. It<br>seems more accurate (or at least, as accurate) to call the years<br>after 1914 a nightmare than to call those before a dream. A lot<br>of the optimism Europeans consider distinctly American is simply<br>what they too were feeling in 1914.<br>\[7\]<br>The point where things start to go wrong seems to be about<br>50%. Above that people get serious about tax avoidance. The reason<br>is that the payoff for avoiding tax grows hyperexponentially (x/1-x<br>for 0 < x < 1). If your income tax rate is 10%, moving to Monaco<br>would only give you 11% more income, which wouldn't even cover the<br>extra cost. If it's 90%, you'd get ten times as much income. And<br>at 98%, as it was briefly in Britain in the 70s, moving to Monaco<br>would give you fifty times as much income. It seems quite likely<br>that European governments of the 70s never drew this curve.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Matthias Felleisen, Jessica<br>Livingston, Robert Morris, Neil Rimer, Hugues Steinier, Brad <br>Templeton, Fred Wilson, and Stephen Wolfram for reading<br>drafts of this, and to Ed Dumbill for inviting me to speak. |
