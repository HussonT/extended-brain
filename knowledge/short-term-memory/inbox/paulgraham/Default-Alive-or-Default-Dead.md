| ![Default Alive or Default Dead?](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/default-alive-or-default-dead-4.gif)<br>October 2015<br>When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or<br>9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.<br>Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth<br>is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to<br>profitability on the money they have left? Or to put it more<br>dramatically, by default do they live or die?<br>The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know.<br>Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive<br>or default dead.<br>If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy<br>[calculator](http://growth.tlb.org/#) you can use to find out.<br>The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive<br>or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the<br>answer. If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious<br>new things they could do. If it's default dead, we probably need<br>to talk about how to save it. We know the current trajectory ends<br>badly. How can they get off that trajectory?<br>Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default<br>dead? Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.<br>It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than<br>it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support<br>himself. But as the company grows older, the question switches from<br>meaningless to critical. That kind of switch often takes people<br>by surprise.<br>I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too<br>late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too<br>early. It's hard to say precisely when the question switches<br>polarity. But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying<br>too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to<br>start worrying too late.<br>The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the<br>[fatal pinch](https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html).<br>The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough<br>time to fix it. And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing<br>that's where they're headed.<br>There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're<br>default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise<br>more money. But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the<br>more you depend on it, the falser it becomes.<br>Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking<br>of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.<br>Say "We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save<br>us." Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your<br>head that it does in mine. And if you set off the alarms sufficiently<br>early, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.<br>It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors<br>saving you. As a rule their interest is a function of<br>growth. If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you<br>can start to count on investors being interested even if you're not<br>profitable.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/aord.html#f1n)\]<br>But investors are so fickle that you can never<br>do more than start to count on them. Sometimes something about your<br>business will spook investors even if your growth is great. So no<br>matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising<br>as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you<br>should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to<br>survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll <br>have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.<br>In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the<br>sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be. In practice there<br>is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends<br>and how fast it grows. When a startup grows fast, it's usually<br>because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big<br>need straight on. When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because<br>the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because<br>they're wasteful.<br>If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just<br>how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead.<br>That one is easy: don't hire too fast. Hiring too fast is by far<br>the biggest killer of startups that raise money.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/aord.html#f2n)\]<br>Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow. But<br>most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than<br>underestimating it. Why? Partly because there's so much work to<br>do. Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough<br>people, it will all get done. Partly because successful startups have<br>lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order<br>to be successful. In fact the large staffs of successful startups<br>are probably more the effect of growth than the cause. And<br>partly because when founders have slow growth they don't want to<br>face what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing<br>enough.<br>Plus founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to<br>overhire by the VCs who funded them. Kill-or-cure strategies are<br>optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect.<br>VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other.<br>But as a founder your incentives are different. You want above all<br>to survive.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/aord.html#f3n)\]<br>Here's a common way startups die. They make something moderately<br>appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first<br>round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea<br>sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately<br>appealing, growth is ok but not great. The founders convince<br>themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth.<br>Their investors agree. But (because the product is only moderately<br>appealing) the growth never comes. Now they're rapidly running out<br>of runway. They hope further investment will save them. But because<br>they have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing<br>to investors. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.<br>What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem:<br>that the product is only moderately appealing. Hiring people is<br>rarely the way to fix that. More often than not it makes it harder.<br>At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be<br>"built out," and that's usually easier with fewer people.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/aord.html#f4n)\]<br>Asking whether you're default alive or default dead may save you<br>from this. Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract the<br>forces that push you to overhire. Instead you'll be compelled to<br>seek growth in other ways. For example, by [doing\<br>things that don't scale](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html), or by redesigning the product in the<br>way only founders can.<br>And for many if not most startups, these paths to growth will be<br>the ones that actually work.<br>Airbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y Combinator<br>before they hired their first employee. In the meantime the founders<br>were terribly overworked. But they were overworked evolving Airbnb<br>into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>Steep usage growth will also interest investors. Revenue<br>will ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x% usage growth<br>predicts x% revenue growth. But in practice investors discount<br>merely predicted revenue, so if you're measuring usage you need a<br>higher growth rate to impress investors.<br>\[2\]<br>Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too<br>fast because they can't afford to. But that doesn't mean you should<br>avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than<br>that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.<br>\[3\]<br>I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders<br>to overhire is not even in their own interest. They don't know how<br>many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have<br>done well if they'd survived. My guess is a significant number.<br>\[4\]<br>After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:<br>"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly. I think<br>it's roughly correct to say that YC's most successful companies<br>have never been the fastest to hire, and one of the marks of a great<br>founder is being able to resist this urge."<br>Paul Buchheit adds:<br>"A related problem that I see a lot is premature scaling—founders<br>take a small business that isn't really working (bad unit economics,<br>typically) and then scale it up because they want impressive growth<br>numbers. This is similar to over-hiring in that it makes the business<br>much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really<br>fast."<br>**Thanks** to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Joe Gebbia, Jessica Livingston,<br>and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this. |
