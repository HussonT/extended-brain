| ![How to Be an Angel Investor](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-be-an-angel-investor-2.gif)<br>March 2009<br>_(This essay is derived from a talk at [AngelConf](http://angelconf.org/).)_<br>When we sold our startup in 1998 I thought one day I'd do some angel<br>investing. Seven years later I still hadn't started. I put it off<br>because it seemed mysterious and complicated. It turns out to be <br>easier than I expected, and also more interesting.<br>The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really<br>isn't. You give a startup money and they give you stock. You'll<br>probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra<br>rights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible<br>debt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and<br>the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding<br>round. <br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f1n)\]<br>There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the<br>other. The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler. But really<br>it doesn't matter much which you use. Don't spend much time worrying<br>about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start<br>angel investing. That's not how you win at this game. When you<br>hear people talking about a successful angel investor, they're not<br>saying "He got a 4x liquidation preference." They're saying "He<br>invested in Google."<br>That's how you win: by investing in the right startups. That is<br>so much more important than anything else that I worry I'm misleading<br>you by even talking about other things.<br>**Mechanics**<br>Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together<br>to invest on the same terms. In a syndicate there is usually a<br>"lead" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup. But not<br>always: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of<br>investors who approach them independently, and the startup's lawyer<br>supplies the paperwork.<br>The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a<br>friend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates.<br>Then all you have to do is write checks.<br>Don't feel like you have to join a syndicate, though. It's not that<br>hard to do it yourself. You can just use the standard <br>[series AA](http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html)<br>documents Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online.<br>You should of course have your lawyer review everything. Both you<br>and the startup should have lawyers. But the lawyers don't have<br>to create the agreement from scratch. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f2n)\]<br>When you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you<br>care about: how much money you're putting in, and the valuation of<br>the company. The valuation determines how much stock you get. If<br>you put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1<br>million, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you<br>get .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company's stock.<br>If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take<br>a chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders just<br>as you did. If in the next round they sell 10% of the company to<br>a new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%.<br>That's ok. Dilution is normal. What saves you from being mistreated<br>in future rounds, usually, is that you're in the same boat as the<br>founders. They can't dilute you without diluting themselves just<br>as much. And they won't dilute themselves unless they end up <br>[net ahead](https://paulgraham.com/equity.html). So in theory, each further <br>round of investment leaves you<br>with a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till after<br>several more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the point<br>where it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has<br>become $5 million. <br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f3n)\]<br>The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that <br>let you contribute to<br>future rounds to maintain your percentage. So it's your choice<br>whether you get diluted. <br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f4n)\]<br>If the company does really well,<br>you eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so<br>high it's not worth it for you.<br>How much does an angel invest? That varies enormously, from $10,000<br>to hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions. The upper<br>bound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise.<br>The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever<br>is greater. A typical angel round these days might be $150,000<br>raised from 5 people.<br>Valuations don't vary as much. For angel rounds it's rare to see<br>a valuation lower than half a million or higher than 4 or 5 million.<br>4 million is starting to be VC territory.<br>How do you decide what valuation to offer? If you're part of a<br>round led by someone else, that problem is solved for you. But<br>what if you're investing by yourself? There's no real answer.<br>There is no rational way to value an early stage startup. The<br>valuation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company's<br>bargaining position. If they really want you, either because they<br>desperately need money, or you're someone who can help them a lot,<br>they'll let you invest at a low valuation. If they don't need you,<br>it will be higher. So guess. The startup may not have any more<br>idea what the number should be than you do. <br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f5n)\]<br>Ultimately it doesn't matter much. When angels make a lot of money<br>from a deal, it's not because they invested at a valuation of $1.5<br>million instead of $3 million. It's because the company was really<br>successful.<br>I can't emphasize that too much. Don't get hung up on mechanics<br>or deal terms. What you should spend your time thinking about is<br>whether the company is good.<br>(Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on deal<br>terms, but should spend their time thinking about how to make the<br>company good.)<br>There's a second less obvious component of an angel investment: how<br>much you're expected to help the startup. Like the amount you<br>invest, this can vary a lot. You don't have to do anything if you<br>don't want to; you could simply be a source of money. Or you can<br>become a de facto employee of the company. Just make sure that you<br>and the startup agree in advance about roughly how much you'll do<br>for them.<br>Really hot companies sometimes have high standards for angels. The<br>ones everyone wants to invest in practically audition investors,<br>and only take money from people who are famous and/or will work<br>hard for them. But don't feel like you have to put in a lot of<br>time or you won't get to invest in any good startups. There is a<br>surprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup is<br>and how well it ends up doing. Lots of hot startups will end up<br>failing, and lots of startups no one likes will end up succeeding.<br>And the latter are so desperate for money that they'll take it from<br>anyone at a low valuation. <br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f6n)\]<br>**Picking Winners**<br>It would be nice to be able to pick those out, wouldn't it? The<br>part of angel investing that has most effect on your returns, picking<br>the right companies, is also the hardest. So you should practically<br>ignore (or more precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everything<br>I've told you so far. You may need to refer to it at some point,<br>but it is not the central issue.<br>The central issue is picking the right startups. What "Make something<br>people want" is for startups, "Pick the right startups" is for<br>investors. Combined they yield "Pick the startups that will make<br>something people want."<br>How do you do that? It's not as simple as picking startups that<br>are already making something wildly popular. By then it's<br>too late for angels. VCs will already be onto them. As an angel,<br>you have to pick startups before they've got a hitâ€”either<br>because they've made something great but users don't realize it<br>yet, like Google early on, or because they're still an iteration<br>or two away from the big hit, like Paypal when they were making<br>software for transferring money between PDAs.<br>To be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential.<br>That's what it comes down to. VCs can be fast followers. Most of<br>them don't try to predict what will win. They just try to notice<br>quickly when something already is winning. But angels have to be<br>able to predict. <br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f7n)\]<br>One interesting consequence of this fact is that there are a lot<br>of people out there who have never even made an angel investment<br>and yet are already better angel investors than they realize.<br>Someone who doesn't know the first thing about the mechanics of<br>venture funding but knows what a successful startup founder looks<br>like is actually far ahead of someone who knows termsheets inside<br>out, but thinks <br>["hacker"](https://paulgraham.com/gba.html) means someone who breaks into computers.<br>If you can recognize good startup founders by empathizing with<br>themâ€”if you both resonate at the same frequencyâ€”then<br>you may already be a better startup picker than the median professional<br>VC. <br>\[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f8n)\]<br>Paul Buchheit, for example, started angel investing about a year<br>after me, and he was pretty much immediately as good as me at picking<br>startups. My extra year of experience was rounding error compared<br>to our ability to empathize with founders.<br>What makes a good founder? If there were a word that meant the<br>opposite of hapless, that would be the one. Bad founders seem<br>hapless. They may be smart, or not, but somehow events overwhelm<br>them and they get discouraged and give up. Good founders make<br>things happen the way they want. Which is not to say they force<br>things to happen in a predefined way. Good founders have a healthy<br>respect for reality. But they are relentlessly resourceful. That's<br>the closest I can get to the opposite of hapless. You want to fund<br>people who are relentlessly resourceful.<br>Notice we started out talking about things, and now we're talking<br>about people. There is an ongoing debate between investors which<br>is more important, the people, or the ideaâ€”or more precisely,<br>the market. Some, like Ron Conway, say it's the peopleâ€”that<br>the idea will change, but the people are the foundation of the<br>company. Whereas Marc Andreessen says he'd back ok founders in a<br>hot market over great founders in a bad one. <br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f9n)\]<br>These two positions are not so far apart as they seem, because good<br>people find good markets. Bill Gates would probably have ended up<br>pretty rich even if IBM hadn't happened to drop the PC standard in<br>his lap.<br>I've thought a lot about the disagreement between the investors who<br>prefer to bet on people and those who prefer to bet on markets.<br>It's kind of surprising that it even exists. You'd expect opinions<br>to have converged more.<br>But I think I've figured out what's going on. The three most<br>prominent people I know who favor markets are Marc, Jawed Karim,<br>and Joe Kraus. And all three of them, in their own startups,<br>basically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fast<br>that it was all they could do to keep up with it. That kind of<br>experience is hard to ignore. Plus I think they underestimate<br>themselves: they think back to how easy it felt to ride that huge<br>thermal upward, and they think "anyone could have done it." But<br>that isn't true; they are not ordinary people.<br>So as an angel investor I think you want to go with Ron Conway and<br>bet on people. Thermals happen, yes, but no one can predict<br>themâ€”not even the founders, and certainly not you as an<br>investor. And only good people can ride the thermals if they hit<br>them anyway.<br>**Deal Flow**<br>Of course the question of how to choose startups presumes you<br>have startups to choose between. How do you find them? This is<br>yet another problem that gets solved for you by syndicates. If you<br>tag along on a friend's investments, you don't have to find startups.<br>The problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a stream<br>of reasonably high quality ones. The traditional way to do this<br>is through contacts. If you're friends with a lot of investors and<br>founders, they'll send deals your way. The Valley basically runs<br>on referrals. And once you start to become known as reliable,<br>useful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you. I certainly<br>will.<br>There's also a newer way to find startups, which is to come to<br>events like Y Combinator's Demo Day, where a batch of newly created<br>startups presents to investors all at once. We have two Demo Days<br>a year, one in March and one in August. These are basically mass<br>referrals.<br>But events like Demo Day only account for a fraction of matches<br>between startups and investors. The personal referral is still the<br>most common route. So if you want to hear about new startups, the<br>best way to do it is to get lots of referrals.<br>The best way to get lots of referrals is to invest in startups. No<br>matter how smart and nice you seem, insiders will be reluctant to<br>send you referrals until you've proven yourself by doing a couple<br>investments. Some smart, nice guys turn out to be flaky,<br>high-maintenance investors. But once you prove yourself as a good<br>investor, the deal flow, as they call it, will increase rapidly in<br>both quality and quantity. At the extreme, for someone like Ron<br>Conway, it is basically identical with the deal flow of the whole<br>Valley.<br>So if you want to invest seriously, the way to get started is to<br>bootstrap yourself off your existing connections, be a good investor<br>in the startups you meet that way, and eventually you'll start a<br>chain reaction. Good investors are rare, even in Silicon Valley.<br>There probably aren't more than a couple hundred serious angels in the whole<br>Valley, and yet they're probably the single most important ingredient<br>in making the Valley what it is. Angels are the limiting reagent<br>in startup formation.<br>If there are only a couple hundred serious angels in the Valley, <br>then by deciding to become one you could single-handedly make the pipeline<br>for startups in Silicon Valley significantly wider. That is kind<br>of mind-blowing.<br>**Being Good**<br>How do you be a good angel investor? The first thing you need is<br>to be decisive. When we talk to founders about good and bad<br>investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say "he<br>writes checks." That doesn't mean the investor says yes to everyone.<br>Far from it. It means he makes up his mind quickly,<br>and follows through. You may be thinking, how hard could that be?<br>You'll see when you try it. It follows from the nature of angel<br>investing that the decisions are hard. You have to guess early,<br>at the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive,<br>because if they were obviously good, VCs would already have funded<br>them.<br>Suppose it's 1998. You come across a startup founded by a couple<br>grad students. They say they're going to work on Internet search.<br>There are already a bunch of big public companies doing search.<br>How can these grad students possibly compete with them? And does<br>search even matter anyway? All the search engines are trying to<br>get people to start calling them "portals" instead. Why would you<br>want to invest in a startup run by a couple of nobodies who are<br>trying to compete with large, aggressive companies in an area they<br>themselves have declared passe? And yet the grad students seem<br>pretty smart. What do you do?<br>There's a hack for being decisive when you're inexperienced: ratchet<br>down the size of your investment till it's an amount you wouldn't<br>care too much about losing. For every rich person (you probably<br>shouldn't try angel investing unless you think of yourself as rich)<br>there's some amount that would be painless, though annoying, to<br>lose. Till you feel comfortable investing, don't invest more than<br>that per startup.<br>For example, if you have $5 million in investable assets, it would<br>probably be painless (though annoying) to lose $15,000. That's<br>less than .3% of your net worth. So start by making 3 or 4 $15,000<br>investments. Nothing will teach you about angel investing like<br>experience. Treat the first few as an educational expense. $60,000<br>is less than a lot of graduate programs. Plus you get equity.<br>What's really uncool is to be strategically indecisive: to string<br>founders along while trying to gather more information about the<br>startup's trajectory. <br>\[ [10](https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f10n)\]<br> There's always a temptation to do that,<br>because you just have so little to go on, but you have to consciously<br>resist it. In the long term it's to your advantage to be good.<br>The other component of being a good angel investor is simply to be<br>a good person. Angel investing is not a business where you make<br>money by screwing people over. Startups create wealth, and<br>creating wealth is not a zero sum game. No one has to lose for you<br>to win. In fact, if you mistreat the founders you invest in, they'll<br>just get demoralized and the company will do worse. Plus your<br>referrals will dry up. So I recommend being good.<br>The most successful angel investors I know are all basically good<br>people. Once they invest in a company, all they want to do is help<br>it. And they'll help people they haven't invested in too. When<br>they do favors they don't seem to keep track of them. It's too<br>much overhead. They just try to help everyone, and assume good<br>things will flow back to them somehow. Empirically that seems to<br>work.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>Convertible debt can be either capped at a particular valuation,<br>or can be done at a discount to whatever the valuation turns out<br>to be when it converts. E.g. convertible debt at a discount of 30%<br>means when it converts you get stock as if you'd invested at a 30%<br>lower valuation. That can be useful in cases where you can't or<br>don't want to figure out what the valuation should be. You leave<br>it to the next investor. On the other hand, a lot of investors<br>want to know exactly what they're getting, so they will only do<br>convertible debt with a cap.<br>\[2\]<br>The expensive part of creating an agreement from scratch is<br>not writing the agreement, but bickering at several hundred<br>dollars an hour over the details. That's why the series AA paperwork<br>aims at a middle ground. You can just start from the compromise<br>you'd have reached after lots of back and forth.<br>When you fund a startup, both your lawyers should be specialists<br>in startups. Do not use ordinary corporate lawyers for this. Their<br>inexperience makes them overbuild: they'll create huge, overcomplicated<br>agreements, and spend hours arguing over irrelevant things.<br>In the Valley, the top startup law firms are Wilson Sonsini, Orrick,<br>Fenwick & West, Gunderson Dettmer, and Cooley Godward. In Boston<br>the best are Goodwin Procter, Wilmer Hale, and Foley Hoag.<br>\[3\]<br>Your mileage may vary.<br>\[4\]<br>These anti-dilution provisions also protect you against<br>tricks like a later investor trying to steal the company by doing<br>another round that values the company at $1. If you have a competent<br>startup lawyer handle the deal for you, you should be protected<br>against such tricks initially. But it could become a problem later.<br>If a big VC firm wants to invest in the startup after you, they may<br>try to make you take out your anti-dilution protections. And if<br>they do the startup will be pressuring you to agree. They'll tell<br>you that if you don't, you're going to kill their deal with the VC.<br>I recommend you solve this problem by having a gentlemen's agreement<br>with the founders: agree with them in advance that you're not going<br>to give up your anti-dilution protections. Then it's up to them<br>to tell VCs early on.<br>The reason you don't want to give them up is the following scenario.<br>The VCs recapitalize the company, meaning they give it additional<br>funding at a pre-money valuation of zero. This wipes out the<br>existing shareholders, including both you and the founders. They<br>then grant the founders lots of options, because they need them to<br>stay around, but you get nothing.<br>Obviously this is not a nice thing to do. It doesn't happen often.<br>Brand-name VCs wouldn't recapitalize a company just to steal a few<br>percent from an angel. But there's a continuum here. A less<br>upstanding, lower-tier VC might be tempted to do it to steal a big<br>chunk of stock.<br>I'm not saying you should always absolutely refuse to give up your<br>anti-dilution protections. Everything is a negotiation. If you're<br>part of a powerful syndicate, you might be able to give up legal<br>protections and rely on social ones. If you invest in a deal led<br>by a big angel like Ron Conway, for example, you're pretty well<br>protected against being mistreated, because any VC would think twice<br>before crossing him. This kind of protection is one of the reasons<br>angels like to invest in syndicates.<br>\[5\]<br>Don't invest so much, or at such a low valuation, that you<br>end up with an excessively large share of a startup, unless you're<br>sure your money will be the last they ever need. Later stage<br>investors won't invest in a company if the founders don't have<br>enough equity left to motivate them. I talked to a VC recently who<br>said he'd met with a company he really liked, but he turned<br>them down because investors already owned more than half of it.<br>Those investors probably thought they'd been pretty clever by getting<br>such a large chunk of this desirable company, but in fact they were<br>shooting themselves in the foot.<br>\[6\]<br>At any given time I know of at least 3 or 4 YC alumni who I<br>believe will be big successes but who are running on vapor,<br>financially, because investors don't yet get what they're doing.<br>(And no, unfortunately, I can't tell you who they are. I can't<br>refer a startup to an investor I don't know.)<br>\[7\]<br>There are some VCs who can predict instead of reacting. Not<br>surprisingly, these are the most successful ones.<br>\[8\]<br>It's somewhat sneaky of me to put it this way, because the<br>median VC loses money. That's one of the most surprising things<br>I've learned about VC while working on Y Combinator. Only a fraction<br>of VCs even have positive returns. The rest exist to satisfy demand<br>among fund managers for venture capital as an asset class. Learning<br>this explained a lot about some of the VCs I encountered when we<br>were working on Viaweb.<br>\[9\]<br>VCs also generally say they prefer great markets to great<br>people. But what they're really saying is they want both. They're<br>so selective that they only even consider great people. So when<br>they say they care above all about big markets, they mean that's<br>how they choose between great people.<br>\[10\]<br>Founders rightly dislike the sort of investor who says he's<br>interested in investing but doesn't want to lead. There are<br>circumstances where this is an acceptable excuse, but more often<br>than not what it means is "No, but if you turn out to be a hot deal,<br>I want to be able to claim retroactively I said yes."<br>If you like a startup enough to invest in it, then invest in it.<br>Just use the standard [series \<br>AA](http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html) terms and write them a check.<br>**Thanks** to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston,<br>Robert Morris, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br>![](http://ycombinator.com/images/y18.gif)[Comment](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=506671) on this essay. |
