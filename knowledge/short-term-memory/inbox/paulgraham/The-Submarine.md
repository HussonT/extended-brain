| ![The Submarine](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-submarine-2.gif)<br>April 2005<br>"Suits make a corporate comeback," says the [_New_\<br>_York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/14/fashion/thursdaystyles/14peacock.html?ex=1271131200&en=e96f2670387e3636&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland). Why does this sound familiar? Maybe because<br>the suit was also back in [February](http://www.cvbizlink.com/articles/2005/04/07/news/news/doc42406f05edf53293947237.prt),<br>[September\<br>2004](http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2004-09-01-suits_x.htm), [June\<br>2004](http://www.cnn.com/2004/BUSINESS/06/23/go.fashion.jones/), [March\<br>2004](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04062/279616.stm), [September\<br>2003](http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/09-03/09-21-03/c01li238.htm), <br>[November\<br>2002](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_46/b3808122.htm), <br>[April 2002](http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/s_65540.html),<br>and [February\<br>2002](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1836010.stm).<br>Why do the media keep running stories saying suits are back? Because<br>PR firms [tell](http://www.maximumexposurepr.com/middleMAA.html) <br>them to. One of the most surprising things I discovered<br>during my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry,<br>lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news. Of the<br>stories you read in traditional media that aren't about politics,<br>crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms.<br>I know because I spent years hunting such "press hits." Our startup spent<br>its entire marketing budget on PR: at a time when we were assembling<br>our own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000<br>a month. And they were worth it. PR is the news equivalent of<br>search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers<br>ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories. \[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/submarine.html#f1n)\]<br>[Our PR firm](http://schwartz-pr.com/client_coverage.php)<br>was one of the best in the business. In 18 months, they got press<br>hits in over 60 different publications. <br>And we weren't the only ones they did great things for. <br>In 1997 I got a call from another<br>startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company. I<br>told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous <br>fees. But I remember thinking his company's name was odd.<br>Why call an auction site "eBay"?<br>**Symbiosis**<br>PR is not dishonest. Not quite. In fact, the reason the best PR<br>firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest.<br>They give reporters genuinely valuable information. A good PR firm<br>won't bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they've<br>worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they<br>don't want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.<br>If anyone is dishonest, it's the reporters. The main reason PR <br>firms exist is that reporters are lazy. Or, to put it more nicely,<br>overworked. Really they ought to be out there digging up stories<br>for themselves. But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and<br>let PR firms bring the stories to them. After all, they know good<br>PR firms won't lie to them.<br>A good flatterer doesn't lie, but tells his victim selective truths<br>(what a nice color your eyes are). Good PR firms use the same<br>strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth<br>favors their clients.<br>For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web <br>let small merchants compete with big ones. This was perfectly true.<br>But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about this<br>particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants<br>were our target market, and we were paying the piper.<br>Different publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms.<br>At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of<br>their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for<br>free if advertisers would let them. \[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/submarine.html#f2n)\] The average<br>trade publication is a bunch of ads, glued together by just enough<br>articles to make it look like a magazine. They're so desperate for<br>"content" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim,<br>if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.<br>At the other extreme are publications like the _New York Times_<br>and the _Wall Street Journal_. Their reporters do go out and<br>find their own stories, at least some of the time. They'll listen <br>to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically. We managed to get press <br>hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed <br>to crack the print edition of the _Times_. \[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/submarine.html#f3n)\]<br>The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity.<br>You don't pitch stories to them. You have to approach them as if<br>you were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope, and make it<br>seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought <br>of themselves.<br>Our greatest PR coup was a two-part one. We estimated, based on<br>some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the<br>Web. We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral <br>enough. But once this "fact" was out there in print, we could quote<br>it to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20%<br>of the online store market.<br>This was roughly true. We really did have the biggest share of the<br>online store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size. But<br>the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.<br>Reporters like definitive statements. For example, many of the<br>stories about Jeremy Jaynes's conviction say that he was one of the<br>10 worst spammers. This "fact" originated in Spamhaus's ROKSO list,<br>which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top<br>spammers. The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but<br>now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment. <br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/submarine.html#f4n)\]<br>All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly<br>big spammer. But reporters don't want to print vague stuff like<br>"fairly big." They want statements with punch, like "top ten." And<br>PR firms give them what they want.<br>Wearing suits, we're told, will make us <br>[3.6\<br>percent](http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2002/02/25/story5.html?t=printable) more productive.<br>**Buzz**<br>Where the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in<br>the generation of "buzz." They usually feed the same story to <br>several different publications at once. And when readers see similar<br>stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend<br>afoot. Which is exactly what they're supposed to think.<br>When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores<br>at midnight to buy the first copies. None of them would have been<br>there without PR firms, who generated such a buzz in<br>the news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain<br>reaction.<br>I doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to <br>track them at work. If you search for the obvious phrases, you<br>turn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the <br>return of the suit. For example, the Reuters article <br>that got picked up by [USA\<br>Today](http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2004-09-01-suits_x.htm) in September 2004. "The suit is back," it begins.<br>Trend articles like this are almost always the work of<br>PR firms. Once you know how to read them, it's straightforward to<br>figure out who the client is. With trend stories, PR firms usually<br>line up one or more "experts" to talk about the industry generally. <br>In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of<br>GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney. \[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/submarine.html#f5n)\] When<br>you get to the end of the experts, look for the client. And bingo, <br>there it is: The Men's Wearhouse.<br>Not surprising, considering The Men's Wearhouse was at that moment <br>running ads saying "The Suit is Back." Talk about a successful<br>press hit-- a wire service article whose first sentence is your own<br>ad copy.<br>The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch<br>is to realize that they all started from the same document back at<br>the PR firm. Search for a few key phrases and the names of the<br>clients and the experts, and you'll turn up other variants of this <br>story.<br>[Casual\<br>fridays are out and dress codes are in](http://bostonworks.boston.com/globe/articles/091904_suit.html) writes Diane E. Lewis<br>in _The Boston Globe_. In a remarkable coincidence, Ms. Lewis's<br>industry contacts also include the creative director of GQ.<br>[Ripped jeans and T-shirts are out,](http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/articles/041108/8eedress.htm) writes Mary Kathleen Flynn in<br>_US News & World Report_. And _she too_ knows the <br>creative director of GQ.<br>[Men's suits\<br>are back](http://www.sexbuzz.com/style/9,0004,00.shtml) writes Nicole Ford in Sexbuzz.Com ("the ultimate men's<br>entertainment magazine").<br>[Dressing\<br>down loses appeal as men suit up at the office](http://www.detnews.com/2004/careers/0405/28/b01-149207.htm) writes Tenisha<br>Mercer of _The Detroit News_.<br>Now that so many news articles are online, I suspect you could find<br>a similar pattern for most trend stories placed by PR firms. I<br>propose we call this new sport "PR diving," and I'm sure there are<br>far more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories.<br>**Online**<br>After spending years chasing them, it's now second nature<br>to me to recognize press hits for what they are. But before we<br>hired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media<br>came from. I could tell a lot of them were crap, but I didn't<br>realize why.<br>Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school, where<br>you had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whether<br>the author was telling the whole truth? If you really want to be<br>a critical reader, it turns out you have to step back one step<br>further, and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth,<br>but _why he's writing about this subject at all._<br>Online, the answer tends to be a lot simpler. Most people who<br>publish online write what they write for the simple reason that<br>they want to. You<br>can't see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, as<br>you can in so many print publications-- which is one of the reasons,<br>though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trust<br>bloggers more than _Business Week_.<br>I was talking recently to a friend who works for a<br>big newspaper. He thought the print media were in serious trouble,<br>and that they were still mostly in denial about it. "They think<br>the decline is cyclic," he said. "Actually it's structural."<br>In other words, the readers are leaving, and they're not coming<br>back.<br>Why? I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest.<br>Imagine how incongruous the _New York Times_ article about<br>suits would sound if you read it in a blog:<br> <br>> The urge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding,<br>>  prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve--<br>>  is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace.<br> <br>The problem<br>with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm.<br>The whole tone is bogus. This is the tone of someone writing down<br>to their audience.<br>Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online<br>is authentic. It's not mystery meat cooked up<br>out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into <br>molds of zippy<br>journalese. It's people writing what they think.<br>I didn't realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial<br>most of the writing in the mainstream media was. I'm not saying<br>I used to believe what I read in _Time_ and _Newsweek_. Since high<br>school, at least, I've thought of magazines like that more as<br>guides to what ordinary people were being<br>[told](https://paulgraham.com/say.html) to think than as <br>sources of information. But I didn't realize till the last <br>few years that writing for publication didn't have to mean writing<br>that way. I didn't realize you could write as candidly and<br>informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.<br>Readers aren't the only ones who've noticed the<br>change. The PR industry has too.<br>A hilarious [article](http://www.prsa.org/_Publications/magazines/0802news1.asp)<br>on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the <br>matter:<br> <br>> Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces<br>>  for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they<br>>  began blogging in the first place.<br>PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers<br>like them. And that means there may be a struggle ahead. As<br>this new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media, we<br>should be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate. <br>When I think <br>how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional <br>media, I can't imagine they'll work any less hard to feed stories<br>to bloggers, if they can figure out how.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\] PR has at least <br>one beneficial feature: it favors small companies. If PR didn't <br>work, the only alternative would be to advertise, and only big<br>companies can afford that.<br>\[2\] Advertisers pay <br>less for ads in free publications, because they assume readers <br>ignore something they get for free. This is why so many trade<br>publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free<br>subscriptions with such abandon.<br>\[3\] Different sections<br>of the _Times_ vary so much in their standards that they're<br>practically different papers. Whoever fed the style section reporter<br>this story about suits coming back would have been sent packing by<br>the regular news reporters.<br>\[4\] The most striking<br>example I know of this type is the "fact" that the Internet worm <br>of 1988 infected 6000 computers. I was there when it was cooked up,<br>and this was the recipe: someone guessed that there were about<br>60,000 computers attached to the Internet, and that the worm might<br>have infected ten percent of them.<br>Actually no one knows how many computers the worm infected, because<br>the remedy was to reboot them, and this destroyed all traces. But<br>people like numbers. And so this one is now [replicated](http://www.google.com/search?q=internet+worm+1988+6000)<br>all over the Internet, like a little worm of its own.<br>\[5\] Not all were<br>necessarily supplied by the PR firm. Reporters sometimes call a few<br>additional sources on their own, like someone adding a few fresh <br>vegetables to a can of soup.<br>**Thanks** to Ingrid Basset, Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica <br>Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, and Aaron Swartz (who<br>also found the PRSA article) for reading drafts of this.<br>**Correction:** Earlier versions used a recent<br>_Business Week_ article mentioning del.icio.us as an example<br>of a press hit, but Joshua Schachter tells me <br>it was spontaneous. |
