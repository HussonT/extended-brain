Have you ever heard of the book “[The Hard Thing about Hard Things](http://amzn.to/2xQyObU)” by Ben Horowitz?

A friend recommended it several months ago, and I’ve had the chance to read 51% of it (it’s hard to find time to read every book cover to cover, right?).

One particular line keeps coming back to me.

It’s a sub-headline that says, “IF YOU’RE GOING TO EAT SHIT, DON’T NIBBLE.”

For those who don’t like cursing, I apologize for the language, but the quote has helped me a lot over the past several months.

It boils down to this — whenever you need to make a tough decision, don’t drag it out to avoid the pain. Instead, it’s better to rip the band-aid off and endure the pain than to prolong it and endure the pain later.

Let’s say, for example, that your ad agency isn’t delivering results, and you decide to fire them and hire someone else. Once you make the decision, it’s time to cut ties and get it over with. Don’t drag it out in order to avoid hurting the feelings of the agency owner.

What needs to be done needs to be done, so pull the trigger and make it happen because the pain is only going to be prolonged if you drag it out. There’s no way to avoid the pain; it’s inevitable.

You can also apply this to firing underperforming employees, quitting a job, firing a client, etc. Those types of things are never easy, so buck up, do you what you need to do, and get it over with.

This doesn’t mean that you should make these kinds of decisions hastily, but it does mean that once you’ve made the decision, it’s better to get it over with than to let it drag on and on.

You may think this is super simple or common sense, but it’s a lesson that’s been coming back to me over and over again the last several months. Whenever I’ve made a difficult decision and need to carry it out, I now remind myself: NOW THAT YOU’VE MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION, DON’T NIBBLE.
