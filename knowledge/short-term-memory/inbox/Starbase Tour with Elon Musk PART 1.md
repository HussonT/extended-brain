# 5 step process at SpaceX

1. Make your requirements less dumb
    1. Your requirements are defo dumb - especially if a smart person gave them to you
2. Try very hard to delete the part or process
    1. If you're not occasionally re-adding things you're not deleting enough
    2. Whatever requirement or constraint you have - it must come with a name, not a departement
3. Simplify or optimize
    1. The most common error is to optimize a thing that should not exist
4. Accelerate cycle time
    1. Not before you've done 1,2 & 3
5. Automate
    1. With that - only do testing at the end - do not do inprocess testing or as little as possible
