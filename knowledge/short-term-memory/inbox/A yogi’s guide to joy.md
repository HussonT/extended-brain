# Day 1 - The source of all suffering

- Being half alive is torture → only one part has become alive, only physical awakening → they will always suffer → you’re always trying to make yourself fully alive through pleasure (money, sex, …)
- Your ability to respond is your ability to be alive → responsibility
- Your ability to respond as “a life” is unlimited but your ability to act is limited

1. The word "Responsibility" means the ability to respond.
    
    1. When you are not responsible for what is not comfortable in your life, you become half-alive.
    2. Your ability to respond as a "life" and to life, determines your ability to be fully alive.
    
      
    

  

# Day 2 - Resisting Change is Resisting Life

“You are not looking at life with zest, you are looking at life with safety” → avoid this

There are slow ways of killing yourself → depression for example is one

1. The essence of physical existence is “change”.
2. If you are resisting change you are resisting life and creating unnecessary suffering.

The word kālá, is the traditional Hindu unit of time, which also relates to the "cyclical", emptiness and space.  
2. The fundamental fabric of life is [time] and that's always moving.  
3. When you flow with the above, you can accept and move with change.  

### Work for day 2

1. Write down one aspect of your life where you are resisting change.
    1. I was doing so with Scarlett - and the vision of the kind of father I thought I needed to be for her
2. Ask yourself, “What can I do in order to relax, dissolve, and release this resistance?”.
    1. Recalibrate your life on true premises that work for me in the very first place.
3. In the next 24 hours, come to an absolute acceptance of everything. (Your mental things, your emotional things, your “body things” and the social things. Accept them as they are).

# Day 3 - The End of Suffering

- When you gain mastery over your life energies your destiny will be 100% in your control and suffering disappears. Today you’ll discover a powerful tool to be “above the intellectual process” of your mind and will make suffering be finished in your life.
    - If a certain state of being is related to a certain action - no one can maintain that activity for 24 hours a day
    - if you know how to make this moment blissful, you can live blissfully - because we only have this moment
    - The very way you feel, think & act is the way your “software” is → everybody you meet has impact on your “software” (these are not trained professionals lol → this software is written unconsciously → we have to create a little space between you and your software
    - Buddha → means above the intellectual process → because all suffering is made in your logical process

  

1. If you take your life energies into control, 100% of your destiny will be in your control.
2. Once you’re above the intellectual process, it’s the end of suffering

## Action for today - understand this:

The first step toward moving from the trap of the intellect to the lap of a larger intelligence is to recognize that every aspect of life is a manifestation of a far greater intelligence than your minuscule intellect.  
1. Take a step and start recognizing every day, all the things you see are a manifestation of a greater intelligence.  
2. Pay attention to how life starts speaking to you.  

  

How are we making ourselves suffer?

1. We generally speak that suffering is physical and mental but physically we can only have pain.
2. Suffering is manufactured in your mind as a reaction to what happens in your body or around you.
3. The kind of thoughts and emotions you generate is 100% yours.

  

# Day 4 - Live a life without fear

1. When we say, “I'm only human”, we are not talking about the possibilities of being a human, but limitations.
    1. We are the most capable and intelligent species on this planet. “Should we actually be talking about our possibilities or limitations?".
    2. Managing your thoughts and emotions leads to a life without fear.

# Day 5 - Suffering or joy - you choose

Outside situations will never happen 100% the way you want them but what happens within you must happen the way you want. In this lesson you will understand why suffering is a choice, and how to find what truly matters to you so you can focus on it.

Key Learning Points  
1. Outside situations will never happen 100% the way you want them.  
2. You have full control over what happens within you, so it must happen the way you want it.  
3. Well-being and the entire human experience come from within.
