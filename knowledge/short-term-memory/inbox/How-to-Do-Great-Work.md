# How to Do Great Work

July 2023

If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided to find out by making it.

Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled "work hard."

The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.

## Choosing What to Work On

The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.

In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.

That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different types of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out.

The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.

Develop a habit of paying attention to things you're not supposed to, either because they're "beneath you" or because they're not "important." If you're curious about something, trust your curiosity. It probably knows something you don't.

## The Importance of Interest

What you work on doesn't just have to be something you're interested in now. It can be something you'd become interested in when you know more about it. But you have to be honest about this. Are you genuinely interested, or do you just think you should be interested? Can you become truly interested in this thing?

The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.

The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world inside.

## Working and Persistence

Let me put the recipe for great work more precisely: if you have a natural aptitude for a field and a burning curiosity about it, and you work harder than your peers, then that's a recipe for doing great work. But working hard is not just a matter of time. You have to work hard on the right things.

Hard work plus natural ability plus working on something important â€” you need all three. It's hard work that makes the difference, because natural ability and importance are not under your control, but effort is.

There are two senses of starting small. One means to try the simplest thing that could possibly work. The other means to get started on something ambitious by doing a small part of it.

Both are valuable techniques. In the sciences you want to try the smallest experiments that can teach you something. In technology you want to build the minimum viable product. And in both cases, you benefit from getting something working quickly.

## Originality and Quality

How do you get new ideas? By taking time to think. If you're not getting new ideas, maybe it's not because you're not smart enough, but because you're not taking enough time to think.

The key to originality is being thorough. When you're working on something, don't just ask whether it's correct. Also ask whether it's complete. Are there implications you haven't explored? Are there applications you haven't considered?

Good new ideas come from trying to build something and discovering a problem that gets in your way. So if you want to find problems to solve, one of the best things you can do is try to build things.

## Dealing with Obstacles

One of the most important skills is learning when to give up. The optimal amount of failure is not zero. If you're never failing, you're probably not taking enough risks.

When you're working on hard problems, you need to have faith that they can be solved. This faith is hard to maintain when you've been stuck for a while. The world looks different when you're discouraged. Everything seems harder than it actually is.

The way to get unstuck is to back up. Instead of beating your head against a wall, try to go around it, or find a different approach to the problem.

## Collaboration and Communication

Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find it satisfying to work on hard problems.

In many fields it's a good idea to have collaborators. If you can find colleagues who care about the same things as you do, that's probably a better predictor of success than your individual talent.

## Recognition and Impact

You have to be comfortable working on things that might not matter. But don't get too comfortable with obscurity. You want to work on something genuinely important.

If you make something good, people will eventually find it. Maybe not immediately, but eventually. So focus on making something good rather than making it popular.

The way to win is to work on something important that you're suited for, where you have the best chance of success.

## Final Thoughts

Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do work you love, you'll find that you have more energy and get better results. It will feel like play.

This recipe for doing great work is more complex than "work hard," but it's also more promising. It doesn't guarantee you'll do great work, because nothing can guarantee that. But it gives you the best chance.

The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?
