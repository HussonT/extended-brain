# Do Things that Don't Scale

July 2013

One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to do things that don't scale. A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don't. You build something, make it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case the market must not exist.

Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. There may be a handful of cases where things grow by themselves, but usually it takes effort.

## Recruit

The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them.

Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, and the problem they solved was an urgent one. If anyone could have sat back and waited for users, it was Stripe. But in fact they're famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.

Startups building things for other startups have a big leg up here, because they understand their users well. But even these companies have to work at it. Look at how much effort Salesforce put into acquiring users when they started.

Sometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately narrow market. It's like keeping a fire contained at first to get it really hot before you let it spread. Facebook is a classic example. When they launched at Harvard, there were about 10,000 people they had to reach, and most of them they could reach through just a few nodes in the social graph.

The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so nearly universal that it might be a good idea for founders to ask themselves explicitly: "What are we doing to find customers? What are we doing to make customers extremely happy?"

## Delight

You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users, but also to make them happy. Over-engaging with users is one of the most common pieces of advice we give at YC, and the startups that do it are the most successful.

Wufoo sent each new user a hand-written thank-you note. Your first users should feel that signing up with you was one of the best decisions they ever made. And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways to delight them.

The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users will be the best you ever get. When you're so big you have to respond through CS reps or surveys, you'll wish you could go back to having individual conversations with users.

## Experience

Sometimes the right unscalable thing is not to do something nice for your users, but to do something for them that you could theoretically automate but haven't yet. This may sound like it's headed toward a problem, but it's actually a great way to learn exactly what you're building.

When manual processes are used to learn, they can actually scale better than automated ones. The knowledge you gain can make your product much more robust when you do automate.

## Fire

Like a fire that should first be got burning hot before being allowed to spread, you want to get your product working brilliantly for a small number of users. Part of the reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they're unlike other things people work on. If you're building a piece of desktop software, for example, you think about how to design it for the generic user. But with startups you're not designing for the generic user, you're trying to win individual users one by one.

The thing about users is that they're individuals. If you win over individuals, you eventually win over markets. But you can't get there by thinking about the market. You have to think about individual users.

## Consult

Sometimes what you're really providing is not a product but a service. And that is perfectly fine. When you only have a small number of users, you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan to automate later. This lets you launch faster, and when you do have the funds to build automated tools, you'll know exactly what to build because you'll have muscle memory from doing it by hand.

When you're starting out, you should be willing to go to extraordinary lengths to make your users happy. Your early users are doing you a favor by giving you a chance. The least you can do is make sure their experience is a good one.

The unscalable things you have to do to get started are not just a necessary evil, but change the company permanently for the better. If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition when you're small, you'll probably be aggressive about user acquisition when you're big. If you have to manufacture your own hardware, or use your software on users' behalf, you'll learn things about manufacturing and about your users that you couldn't have learned otherwise.

## Vector

Among companies, the closest analog to butterflies in the wild are probably startups. And when you look at how both butterflies and successful startups get where they're going, you find another similarity: they both make use of currents. A butterfly can't fly in still air. Neither can a startup.

It's not just that you need the wind at your back. What you're looking for are thermalsâ€”powerful, long-lasting updrafts. In technology, those come from new platforms. That's part of what made the late 1990s so exciting. The web was a new platform, and lots of startups benefited from that.

The constraint that forces startups to act is that they have limited funds. If you had unlimited time and money, the optimal solution would be to build the perfect product and then launch it. But startups don't have unlimited time and money. They have to make the best they can with what they've got.

The need to do something manually at first actually provides a valuable constraint, because it prevents you from making a common mistake: premature optimization. Premature optimization is not just a mistake in programming. It's a mistake in startups too.

So if you're working on something that could be huge, don't worry that it doesn't seem to be huge at first. It has to start somewhere. The biggest companies often have surprisingly humble beginnings.

Pay close attention to your users. Get to know them. Sometimes the right unscalable thing is simply to pay individual attention to them. That's what we do at Y Combinator, and it's why we're able to help so many startups.

Doing things that don't scale is not just a phase you go through. It should be the DNA of your company.
