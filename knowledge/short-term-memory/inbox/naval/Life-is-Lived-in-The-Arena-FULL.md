# Life is Lived in The Arena

Jul 17 2025

**Naval:** Life is lived in the arena. You only learn by doing. And if you’re not doing, then all the learning you’re picking up is too general and too abstract. Then it truly is Hallmark aphorisms. You don’t know what applies where and when.

And a lot of this kind of general principles and advice is not mathematics. Sometimes you’re using the word rich to mean one thing. Other times you’re using it to mean another thing. Same with the word wealth. Same with the word love or happiness. These are overloaded terms. So this is not mathematics.

These are not precise definitions. You can’t form a playbook out of them that you can just follow like a computer. Instead, you have to understand what context to apply them in. So the right way to learn is to actually go do something, and when you’re doing it, you figure something out about how it should be done.

Then you can go and look at something I tweeted or something you read in [Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) or something you read in [Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer) or something you saw online and say, “Oh, that’s what that guy meant. That’s the general principle he’s talking about. And I know to apply it in situations like this, not mechanically, not a hundred percent of the time, but as a helpful heuristic for when I encounter this situation again.”

You start with reasoning and then you build up your judgment. And then when your judgment is sufficiently refined, it just becomes taste or intuition or gut feel, and that’s what you operate on. But you have to start from the specific.

If you start from the general, and stay at the level of the general—and just read books of principles and aphorisms and almanacs and so on—you’re going to be like that person that went to university: overeducated, but they’re lost. They try to apply things in the wrong places. What [Nassim Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) calls the intellectual yet idiots, IYIs.

One of the tweets I was going to bring up is exactly that. From [June 3rd](https://x.com/naval/status/1930058059172458665): “Acquiring knowledge is easy. The hard part is knowing what to apply and when. That’s why all true learning is on the job. Life is lived in the arena.”

**Naval:** I like that tweet.

Actually, I just wanted to tweet, “Life is lived in the arena” and that was it. I wanted to just drop it right there. But I felt like I had to explain just a little bit more because “ [The man in the arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic)” is a famous quote, so I wanted to unpack a little bit from my direction. But this is a realization that I keep having over and over.
