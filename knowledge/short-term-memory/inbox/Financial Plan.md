# Day 8

Last week we spoke about intention and so, this week, we are going to work on creating intentions for your business. We are going to create a draft of your new business plan. (If you already have a business plan, please play along and brush it up as we go through each of the steps.

The idea of this week is not to complete a perfect final business plan, but rather to get the process started and begin to create some clarity about your plans for your business.

### **Homework**

1. Get started on your business plan. If you already have one, draft a new one.
2. Reflect and answer the questions in your workbook.
3. Share your insights with the Tribe.

Note: The key aspect of your business plan is the 3 questions you need to ask in order to gain clarity about your plans for your business. Answer the questions in your workbook and use them as a template around which your business plan will be based.
