### Notes

What matters most for a founder?

- Clarity of vision
    - Clearly tell why & what you're doing
- Very determined & passionate
    - Always somehow mission oriented
- Raw intelligence
- The ability to get things done quickly
- Quality fo decision making

  

  

## How do you keep conviction?

- The quicker you can launch & have a set of users you can depend upon the easier it is to keep conviction
- If you can see a shift in the world that others havent and rationalize that to yourself, that's a great way too ...

  

  

# Try to get better at something 10% every week

  

You can ignore everyone except your users

  

## When to pivot

Only pivots that works

- its what the founder wanted to build anyway from the get go
    - Kevin with Instagram
- its what the founding team learned when they were building something else
    - "When you discover that other people need"
    - For ex AirBnB
- What doesn't work is sitting in front of a whiteboard and deciding "what are we going to do next"

  

## Focus on product means

- Focus on love not like - small set of users that really love me
- spend your time writing to code & talking to users

  

## Growth solves all problems

- The prime directive of any startup is "never lose momentum"

  

## Fake work

- Do none of the work that would make it into a reality TV show
- "they choose the best lawyer in the world, they have a beautiful logo"

  

You have to tradeoff to get the real big things right with letting some stuff "below the line" just burn

  

## Distractions

- Public image obsessioin (getting on the 30 under 30 lists)
- "Networking"

  

## Greatest mistake great founders make

- Waiting too long to fire bad people

  

## The days are long but the years are short

- window of opportunity is pretty short in a lifetime for a startup

  

## How to fire somebody

- Treat them like a human
- Do everything you possibly can to make it feel like a win for them
- Every person I fired I found a job before letting them go
