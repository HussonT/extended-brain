## What are thunderlizzards?

- Have gone through blitzscaling
- born from radioactive eggs
- They then swim across the ocean
- He emerges in SF and wreaks havoc
    
    Thunderlizards: Convert advantages to disruptive power, minimises technical and organisational debt, achieves product market fit, avoids competition  
      
    Organizational Debt: The interest companies pay when their structure and policies stay fixed and/or accumulate as the world changes.  
      
    “Whenever there’s been a huge discontinuous shift in the economy, it’s always been led by something that’s changed in transportation.”  
      
    Every great startup has one fundamental assumption that has a 50% chance of being correct but if true will pay off multiple times over  
      
    One of the most important things is the speed of making decisions as on one hand it accelerates progress and on the other it identifies all the roadblocks that you have to be cognizant about.  
      
    Example of authenticity - Founder of the startup could be the customer (and thus have empathy for them).  
      
    The “balancing” is much easier when you focus on acquiring a reliable supply before jumping into demand.  
      
    Ideal number of founders 2-4  
      
    The best companies are all finding people internally to unlock the greatest talent that is latent within another organisation.

        - Be proactive about who you're going to be

  

# What can you ignore - what do you prioritise?

- Priority is at the bottom of that stack

  

# Marketplaces

- First focus for a marketplace is not demand but supply
    
    - How longterm does supply want to stay on that platform?
    - Demand will follow
    
      
    

# Hiring

- Can you do internal hiring? → who within your own team can you activate to hire yourself
- Best hires are internal hires
