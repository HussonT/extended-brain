# Read History

You can cheat by looking at all the good ideas & insights of history

  

# How do you run?

→ don't try to reinvent everything

→ but core processes like hiring etc are worth figuring out from first principles

- Stripe was okay waiting a really long time to hire the best people
- Took months - because the smartest people are already doing pretty cool things
- did month long trial runs
- You could filter on interest & then seek the good ones
    - but the better ways is probably to find the good ones & then convert them to your cause
- There's a compound interest to hiring great people
    - great people attract great people
    - "Do I want to hire this people with the 50 people this person is going to hire?
