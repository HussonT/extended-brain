**Startups depend on the big platforms, which stiffles innovation**

"The good news is that billions of people got access to amazing technologies,  
many of which were free to use. The bad news is that it became much harder  
for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presence  
without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them,  
taking away their audiences and profits."  
  
  
**Societal tensions arise from this centralised power**  
This in turn stifled innovation, making the internet less interesting and dynamic.  
Centralization has also created broader societal tensions, which we see in  
the debates over subjects like fake news, state sponsored bots,  
“no platforming” of users, EU privacy laws, and algorithmic biases.  
These debates will only intensify in the coming years.  
  
T  
he internet is a software based network that can be re-architected  
Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras:  
community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will  
eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.  

### Why decentralisation?

Not (only) bc of govt censorship or libert political views  
  
  
Bait & Switch:  
Centralised platforms rely on 3rd party complements to make their  
platform more valuable, as that value grows, so does their power over  
these 3rd parties

When they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing lies in extracting data from users and competing with complements over audiences and profits. Historical examples of this are  
Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, and Twitter  
vs. its 3rd-party clients  

  

### Enter cryptonetworks

Layer on top of the internet with token economics

Cryptonetworks are networks built on top of the internet that 1) use consensus mechanisms such as blockchains to maintain and update state, 2) use cryptocurrencies (coins/tokens) to incentivize consensus participants (miners/validators) and other network participants.

  

Cryptonetwork fix the problem of maintaining internet infrastructure

  

Cryptonetworks use multiple mechanisms to ensure that they stay neutral as they grow, preventing the bait-and-switch of centralized platforms.

  

**How decentralization wins**

_“No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.” — Bill Joy_

  

An illustrative analogy is the rivalry in the 2000s between Wikipedia and its centralized competitors like Encarta. If you compared the two products in the early 2000s, Encarta was a far better product, with better topic coverage and higher accuracy. But Wikipedia improved at a much faster rate, because it had an active community of volunteer contributors who were attracted to its decentralized, community-governed ethos. By 2005, Wikipedia was the most popular reference site on the internet. Encarta was shut down in 2009.

  

_“If you asked people in 1989 what they needed to make their life better, it was unlikely that they would have said a decentralized network of information nodes that are linked using hypertext.” — Farmer & Farmer_

  

Two phases of product market fit

Decentralized platforms, by contrast, often launch half-baked and without clear use cases. As a result, they need to go through two phases of product-market fit: 1) product-market fit between the platform and the developers/entrepreneurs who will finish the platform and build out the ecosystem, and 2) product-market fit between the platform/ecosystem and end users. This two-stage process is what causes many people — including sophisticated technologists — to consistently underestimate the potential of decentralized platforms.
