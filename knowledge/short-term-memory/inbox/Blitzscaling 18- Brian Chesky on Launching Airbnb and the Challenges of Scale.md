- All big ideas sound like a bad idea - so don’t worry about somebody reading your bad idea
- All big ideas feel like you solving your own problem at first
- Used cereal to fund the company

  

# Inflection point

- Enemy of a startup is everybody else’s life
- Startups don’t die they fade away
- It’s better to have 100 people who really like you instead a mil that sorta like you - do things that don’t scale
    
    - Click a button - next day photographer shows up
    - Really really really know your customer
    
    # Scale
    
    - The network naturally grow + target events g
    - Events & PR were main ways of growth
        
        - Being a provocative idea is easy to get written about
        
        # 7 star design
        
        - What’s an ok 5 star experience?
            
            - Then what’s 6 star? 7 star? 8 star? ...
            
              
            
    
    # Design culture
    
    - Airbnb recreated a lot of their homes as Meeting rooms = making the focus tactile
    - People need to be immersed in what you do
    - Culture = what are we all focused on
    - Culture = shared way of doing things
    - There’s weak & strong cultures = a culture where everyone was on a mission and it was shared
    - Strong culture is a founder led cause and they start believing in what they’re doing
    - Hiring is the most important thing to culture
        - Interview everyone
        - Functional interviews + cultural interviews
        - Check for core values
            - For example one of core values is to be a host
            - Core values council
            - Culture = built on beliefs that never change
            - Culture is about repetition
            - You can design culture - for example little reminders
            - Culture = what is the team that we’re playing and what does winning look like for us?
    
    # Then scale
    
    - Learn hiring & then management of the people you hired
    - Recruit & then manage - how tf do you do that lol?
        - Classic management mistake
            - People complain so you try to appease them
            - Moving from intuition to data informed decisions
            - Thinking more long term
            - Actually having a plan/roadmap
        - What got you here is not what will get you there
    - Every 6 months you keep your job its a promotion
    - Know it all never scale in startups - be an infinite learner
    
      
    
    Stage 1 - not dying
    
      
    
    Stage 2 - fire fighting
    
      
    
    Stage 3 - now it’s true existential threats (they want to copy you)
    
    - Story of the brother copying Airbnb
    - Whoever has the best product wins
    
      
    
    # Govt relations
    
    - Kill em with kindness
    - It’s a lot harder to hate somebody up-close
    
      
    
      
    
    # Co-founders
