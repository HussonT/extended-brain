# Founder Mode

September 2024

At a YC event last week, Brian Chesky gave a talk that everyone who was there will remember. The theme was running your company, and the audience was a mix of founders at different stages—some leading startups with over 1000 employees.

Brian described how conventional management wisdom had been damaging Airbnb. The standard advice was to "hire good people and give them room to do their jobs." He followed this advice and hired experienced executives from other big tech companies. But he found that as he followed their advice to be less involved, the company's performance declined.

So he decided to go against conventional wisdom and run the company more like Steve Jobs. He got more involved in details, talked directly to people several levels below him, and ignored the layers of hierarchy that were supposed to exist. The company's performance improved dramatically.

This was the origin of what I'm calling "founder mode."

The theme of Brian's talk, and the reason it resonated so much, is that the conventional wisdom about how to run larger companies is mistaken. As your company grows, the received wisdom says you have to choose between micromanaging and delegate-and-retreat. You're told you have to hire "professional managers" and get out of their way.

But this turns out to be a false dichotomy. There's a third option: founder mode.

I suspect founder mode is not just different from manager mode but practically its opposite. The way managers are trained to run companies seems to be like a piece of obfuscated code—like someone tried to translate the good version into a completely different language, and what we ended up with only works by accident, if at all.

We don't yet know exactly what founder mode consists of. It's still being discovered. But it's clear that it involves much more direct involvement by the founder than manager mode allows. Skip-level meetings, for example, will likely prove to be far more normal in founder mode than in manager mode.

And there will probably be other differences we haven't discovered yet. The fact that founders can do things that managers can't is one of the reasons startups can sometimes beat big companies. So founder mode might be particularly useful in competitive situations.

Obviously founders can't keep running a 2000 person company the way they ran it when it had 20. But maybe the right answer isn't to switch entirely to manager mode. Maybe it's to evolve founder mode to work at larger scales.

I predict this is going to be a big deal. Everyone who's founded a startup has probably felt like they were swimming against the current of conventional wisdom. They've felt like everything they were being told to do was wrong. And perhaps it mostly was.

Many of the most successful founders have been practicing some form of founder mode already—often unconsciously. I suspect that once we understand founder mode better, we'll find that many of the things that made certain founders successful were not anomalies but manifestations of founder mode.

Of course, not every founder should try to run their company like Steve Jobs. But I think more founders should be aware that there's another option.

Some founders will abuse this concept. They'll use "founder mode" as an excuse for micromanaging or for not wanting to delegate. But the mere fact that founder mode can be misused doesn't invalidate it any more than the fact that manager mode is often misused invalidates it.

The winds of change are blowing. Founders have been achieving great things while swimming against the current of bad advice. Imagine what they'll do once we figure out the right advice and can teach them to run their companies like Steve Jobs instead of John Sculley.
