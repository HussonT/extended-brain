1. Personal Summary
    1. The Impact Billionaires is a "code & media" leveraging business with which I would like to buy my total freedom. And total freedom means that I love what I do but get to do it on my own time, from anywhere in the world. The story with The Impact Billionaires is that I want to impact as many people positively as possible as I can, without it being a struggle. I want it to be an effortless force for good where I get to use all my talents & surround myself with people who add to my talents.
2. Executive Summary
    1. As I said, primarily it will be a code & media leveraging business that solves for 3 key aspects: bigger questions, bigger ideas & bigger impact.
