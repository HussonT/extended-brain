The article discusses the philosophical differences in people's approach to decision-making, specifically the tradeoff between compromise and purity. The author terms these approaches as "concave" and "convex" dispositions.

A person with a concave disposition tends to prefer balance and avoids extremes. They are open to implementing parts of opposing philosophies that offer the most benefits and lowest risks and are cautious about going to extremes where risks may outweigh benefits.

A person with a convex disposition, on the other hand, tends to stick to one path and avoids mixing things up. They believe in focusing and mastering one thing instead of being a generalist. They are wary of making compromises as they believe it may lead to larger concessions.

The author states that he is more sympathetic to the concave approach in various contexts. He uses examples from the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems to illustrate his viewpoints. The author notes that these mindsets are not limited to decision-making in cryptocurrencies but apply to politics, technology choices, and even food preferences.
