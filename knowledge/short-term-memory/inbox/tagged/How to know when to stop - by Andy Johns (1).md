_üëã Hey,_ [_Lenny_](https://twitter.com/lennysan) _here! Welcome to a ‚ú® **monthly free edition** ‚ú® of my weekly newsletter. Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, working with humans, and anything else that‚Äôs stressing you out about work._

_If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, here‚Äôs what you missed this month:_

When [Andy Johns](https://twitter.com/ibringtraffic) (growth legend via Facebook, Twitter, Wealthfront, and Quora) [began opening up](https://twitter.com/ibringtraffic/status/1499898173875048448) about his mental health journey, it caught my attention. All you ever hear about on social media are people‚Äôs wins. Everyone‚Äôs killing it! Rarely do you see someone of Andy‚Äôs stature share what‚Äôs really going on.

I knew more people needed to hear Andy‚Äôs story, so I immediately DM‚Äôd him to see if he‚Äôd be up for writing a guest post. I‚Äôm so happy he agreed.

Below, you‚Äôll find what I genuinely believe to be one of the most important posts this newsletter has ever seen. The stories, the transparency, and the incredibly actionable advice (including templates and worksheets!) is like nothing you‚Äôll find elsewhere. I encourage you to read it, and re-read it. Thank you for sharing this with us, Andy üôè And for more, make sure to subscribe to [Andy‚Äôs Newsletter](https://andyjohns.substack.com/) and [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ibringtraffic/).

> ### ‚ÄîEpictetus

In 2018, the universe sent me a sign saying, ‚ÄúSlow the fuck down!‚Äù

I had recently been promoted to president at Wealthfront after 15 hard years of climbing the startup ladder. Yet after only a few months in my new position, I was in the emergency room with heart issues.

After several tests, the doctors told me that my heart was like a lopsided tire. It worked, but it wobbled. Some parts of my heart were enlarged, and others had a thick, rigid texture that I imagine is like the low-quality meat you find in a bad bowl of pho.

The cardiologist gave me the ‚ÄúYou know how many 40-year-old CEOs I know who have heart attacks?‚Äù talk. Except I was only 35 at the time. I knew that I was constantly stressed out and exhausted from work. But I was unaware of just how fragile my health had become.

He lectured me on what I needed to do moving forward. I needed more rest, more exercise, a better diet, and less stress. It‚Äôs advice that I already knew but that I ignored while in the ‚Äúfog of war‚Äù of high-growth startups. Yet it was clear that I had had enough. So I stepped down and left the company to focus on my well-being.

## Systemic imbalance

In retrospect, the signs were there that I was pushing too hard. I suspect the same is true for many of us in high-profile positions, high-profile startups, or high-stress industries.

To help prove that, I decided to run a few surveys on LinkedIn.

Nearly 50% of responders had thought about changing their careers at least three times due to it ‚Äúnot being worth it.‚Äù And another 50% had cried because of work at least twice. It seems commonplace within our work culture to push ourselves to a breaking point, whether it‚Äôs physical or psychological. Often it‚Äôs both, as our body and mind are intertwined.

Nonetheless, as someone who was conditioned to always aim for the top, like many high achievers in the world of tech, I was having a hard time reconciling the limitations of my health with my professional ambitions.

It was clear that I needed to make a trade-off to avoid a fate that others had faced, like the sad loss of the wonderful [Dave Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Goldberg) at the age of 47. It also required that I step back and make a holistic assessment of what matters to me. Not just with work but with the broader tapestry that makes up a complete life, including human connection and nurturing experiences.

So I created a framework to do so. It has three parts:

1. **Define your personal range of tolerance**
2. **Pick your career progression**
3. **Pick your life progression**

I should have followed these steps earlier in my life. But because of my relentless, single-minded pursuit of success, I had to do so somewhat retroactively. I hope this framework will help you avoid my mistakes and establish a balanced life that allows you to thrive in many dimensions of life, not just the professional.

## Part 1: Define your range of tolerance

Stemming from my heart attack scare‚Äîa clear sign that I was overloaded‚ÄîI began creating a plan to keep myself out of extended periods of unsustainable stress. That‚Äôs when I rediscovered the [concept of a range of tolerance](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/biogeography/a/tolerance-ranges-of-species) and started to apply it to myself.

After a few years of iterating on it and pursuing it earnestly, it‚Äôs led to a quality of life that I wouldn‚Äôt trade for any salary. Here‚Äôs more on how it works.

### Where does life flourish?

Life is found everywhere on the planet, but it is not evenly distributed. That‚Äôs because life has an optimal zone to survive and reproduce.

For example, Atlantic salmon spend most of their adult life at sea, but they make an annual trek into freshwater to breed. Most other saltwater fish die quickly when placed in freshwater, but it‚Äôs a variable that the salmon are uniquely accustomed to.

Staying within a range of acceptable tolerance in your life should be the goal, so that you flourish in all dimensions, not just the professional. Taking on too much pushes us into zones of intolerance, where very little life can be sustained.

### How do I know if I‚Äôm outside my range of tolerance?

When pushed outside our tolerance range, we will experience a wide range of indicators.

One category of indicators is hormonal dysregulation, which reveals itself in the form of negative emotional states. We can feel irritable, anxious, sad, angry, withdrawn, or shut down.

The second category of indicators of unmanageable stress is [physiological](https://www.apa.org/topics/stress/body). Our natural bodily functions are interrupted, including the musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinal, gastrointestinal, nervous, and reproductive systems.

Lastly, we may adopt destructive behavioral patterns to soothe our emotional discomfort. We may develop [addictions or compulsive activities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732004/) as a coping mechanism due to excess stress. I know a lot of people who need a bottle or two of wine several nights a week in order to ‚Äúunwind.‚Äù That‚Äôs not healthy behavior.

### Take an inventory of possible stress responses

In the first few months of receiving therapy, I quickly wised up to all the ways in which my mind, body, and habits were telling me that I was on a bad path.

My therapist sat me down and ran me through an inventory of my bodily sensations, taking note of my jaw and neck tension, tightness in my chest, shallow breathing, and huge bags under my eyes.

Next, she dissected my habits and behaviors. She expertly pointed out all the ways in which my work routine had sidelined healthy habits and replaced them with unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as smoking pot at night in order to sleep.

As the months and years went on, I became much more attuned to myself, which gave me the tools to assess how I was doing at any point in time. That turned out to be the first in a series of steps that I took to defend my health and know when to take a break.

Based on what I learned through therapy, and in conjunction with comprehensive research on the subject of [chronic stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579396/), I created [a simple questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d7uxama7vhNwWLVrpgGvxNObU0cCuRE9bXxgbwNCkn0/edit?usp=sharing) that you can copy and use yourself:

![[https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2Ff8910d04-6a0a-4f41-bebb-a4777074e3a5_966x1016.png]]

Note that assessments like this can be subjective, so there isn‚Äôt a clear line in the sand that perfectly describes the state of your mental health. But they can be reliable indicators that someone may need to seek help.

There are also publicly available tests that are clinically used and approved and can be taken for free. The [Beck Depression Inventory](https://www.ismanet.org/doctoryourspirit/pdfs/Beck-Depression-Inventory-BDI.pdf) is widely used, as is the [Patient Health Questionnaire](https://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9). With many of these tests, if you score near the midpoint of the total possible score, you‚Äôre entering a clinical level of depression that professionals would deem worthy of treatment.

If you want to know more about the mind-body connection, Gabor Mat√© has an incredible lecture that discusses the relationship between trauma and our health. I suggest carving out an hour to give it a listen. He is one of the best in the world at discussing the human condition:
