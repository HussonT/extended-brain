# The Top Idea in Your Mind 

[1]
I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given
time.  That's the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they're
allowed to drift freely.  And this idea will thus tend to get all
the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of
it.  Which means it's a disaster to let the wrong idea become the
top one in your mind.
What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn't want as the
top one in my mind for two long stretches.
I'd noticed startups got way less done when they started raising
money, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood
why.  The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with
investors.  The problem is that once you start raising money, raising
money becomes the top idea in your mind.  That becomes what you
think about when you take a shower in the morning.  And that means
other questions aren't.
I'd hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I'd forgotten
why I hated it so much.  When we raised money for Y Combinator, I
remembered.  Money matters are particularly likely to become the
top idea in your mind.  The reason is that they have to be.  It's
hard to get money.  It's not the sort of thing that happens by
default.  It's not going to happen unless you let it become the
thing you think about in the shower.  And then you'll make little
progress on anything else you'd rather be working on.

(I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors.  Professors
nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a
little research on the side.  It may be time to fix that.)
The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the
preceding 10 years I'd been able to think about what I wanted.  So
the contrast when I couldn't was sharp.  But I don't think this
problem is unique to me, because just about every startup I've seen
