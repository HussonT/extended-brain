First-To-Mind Wins Companies who form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom line. These companies attach their product to “internal triggers.” As a result, users show up without any external prompting. (Location 43)

Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an email, a website link, or the app icon on a phone. (Location 82)

Action Following the trigger comes the action: the behavior done in anticipation of a reward. (Location 89)

Companies leverage two basic pulleys of human behavior to increase the likelihood of an action occurring: the ease of performing an action and the psychological motivation to do it.[x] (Location 93)

Variable Reward What distinguishes the Hook Model from a plain vanilla feedback loop is the hook’s ability to create a craving. Feedback loops are all around us, but predictable ones don’t create desire. (Location 97)

Investment The last phase of the Hook Model is where the user does a bit of work. The investment phase increases the odds that the user will make another pass through the hook cycle in the future. The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money. (Location 112)

These commitments can be leveraged to make the trigger more engaging, the action easier, and the reward more exciting with every pass through the hook cycle. (Location 118)

Accordingly, this book teaches innovators how to build products to help people do the things they already want to do but, for lack of a solution, don’t do. (Location 143)

Remember and Share - Habits are defined as behaviors done with little or no conscious thought. - The convergence of access, data, and speed is making the world a more habit-forming place. - Businesses that create customer habits gain a significant competitive advantage. - The Hook Model describes an experience designed to connect the user's problem to a solution frequently enough to form a habit. - The Hook Model has four phases: trigger, action, variable reward, and investment.[xvi] (Location 158)

Habit-forming products change user behavior and create unprompted user engagement. The aim is to influence customers to use your product on their own, again and again, without relying on overt calls-to-action such as ads or promotions. (Location 196)

Entrepreneurs should evaluate how user habits impact their particular business model and goals. While the viability of some products depends on habit-formation to thrive, that is not always the case. (Location 200)

Increasing Customer Lifetime Value MBAs are taught that a business is worth the sum of its future profits. This benchmark is how investors calculate the fair price of a company’s shares. (Location 208)

In 2011, Libin published a chart now known as the “smile graph.” With the percentage of sign-ups represented on the Y-axis and time spent on the service on the X-axis, the chart showed that, although usage plummeted at first, it rocketed upward as people formed a habit of using the service. The resulting down and up curve gave the chart its emblematic smile shape (and Evernote’s CEO a matching grin). (Location 235)

“The most important factor to increasing growth is ... Viral Cycle Time.”[xxv] Viral Cycle Time is the amount of time it takes a user to invite another user, and it can have a massive impact. (Location 250)

Having a greater proportion of users returning to a service daily, dramatically increases Viral Cycle Time for two reasons: First, daily users initiate loops more often (think tagging a friend in a Facebook photo); second, more daily active users means more people to respond and react to each invitation.

Habit as Strategy Sometimes a behavior does not occur as frequently as flossing or Googling, but it still becomes a habit. For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain. (Location 322)

In the Habit Zone A company can begin to determine its product’s habit-forming potential by plotting two factors: frequency (how often the behavior occurs) and perceived utility (how useful and rewarding the behavior is in the user’s mind over alternative solutions). (Location 340)

Products fail for a variety of reasons: Companies run out of funding, products enter markets too early or too late, the marketplace doesn’t need what companies are offering, or founders simply give up. Just as failure has many causes, success too can be attributed to a variety of factors. However, one thing is common to all successful innovations — they solve problems. (Location 361)

Before making up your mind on the vitamin or painkiller debate for some of the world’s most successful tech companies, consider this idea: A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of pain. (Location 384)

It is important to clarify that the term “pain,” as it is frequently used in business school and marketing books, is somewhat hyperbolic. In reality, the experience we are talking about is more similar to an “itch,” a feeling that manifests within the mind and causes discomfort until it is satisfied. (Location 386)

Addictions, by definition, are self-destructive. Thus, it is irresponsible to make products that rely on creating and maintaining user addiction, since doing so would mean intentionally harming people.  A habit, on the other hand, is a behavior that can have a positive influence on a person’s life. Habits can be healthy or unhealthy, and you likely have several helpful habits you carry out throughout your day. Did you brush your teeth today? Take a shower? Did you express gratitude by saying “thanks?” Or in my case, say “Good morning” while on an evening jog? These are common behaviors done with little or no deliberation — they are habits.

Remember and Share - For some businesses, forming habits is a critical component to success, but not every business requires habitual user engagement. - When successful, forming strong user habits can have several business benefits including: higher customer lifetime value, greater pricing flexibility, supercharged growth, and a sharper competitive edge. - Habits can not form outside the “Habit Zone,” where the behavior occurs with enough frequency and perceived utility. - Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamins) but once the habit is formed, they become must-haves (painkillers). - Habit-forming products alleviate users’ pain by relieving a pronounced itch. - Designing habit-forming products is a form of manipulation. Product builders would benefit from a bit of introspection before attempting to hook users to make sure they are building healthy habits, not unhealthy addictions (more to come on this topic in chapter eight).

Do This Now If you are building a habit-forming product, write down the answers to these questions: - What habits does your business model require? - What problem are users turning to your product to solve? - How do users currently solve that problem and why does it need a solution? - How frequently do you expect users to engage with your product? - What user behavior do you want to make into a habit?

Supercharging Growth Users who continually find value in a product are more likely to tell their friends about it. Frequent usage creates more opportunities to encourage people to invite their friends, broadcast content, and share through word-of-mouth. (Location 242)

The enemy of forming new habits is past behaviors, and research suggests that old habits die hard. Even when we change our routines, neural pathways remain etched in our brains, ready to be reactivated when we lose focus.[xxxi] This presents an especially difficult challenge for product designers trying to create new lines or businesses based on forming new habits.
