When I run after what I think I want, my days are a furnace of distress and anxiety; If I sit in my own place of patience, what I need flows to me, and without any pain. From this I understand that what I want also wants me, is looking for me and attracting me. There is a great secret in this for anyone who can grasp it.

And this is where the phenomenon gets weirder. Human beings, when operating as cancer cells, choose not to see themselves as cancer cells. They see themselves as doing what is right and needed. But as Stanley Milgram’s famous prison experiments show, we don’t often do what is right. We follow orders, hierarchies, patterns, and rules—often over heart, mission, and values. We do this out of compliance and our human need to fit into a tribe or community. ([Location 2705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WNDJ1K9&location=2705))
