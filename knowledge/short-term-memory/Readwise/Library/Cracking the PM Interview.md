The PM needs to set vision and strategy. The PM defines success and makes decisions. (Location 221)

product managers don’t have direct authority over the people on their team. (Location 223)

The product manager usually serves as the main liaison between the engineerings and other roles such as design, quality assurance, user research, data analysts, marketing, sales, customer support, business development, legal, content writers, other engineering teams, and the executive team.

Since the product manager’s role in product design can vary so much across teams, it’s a great thing to ask about during your interview. (Location 278)

Ask about who you’ll be working with on your core and extended team. Find out how much of your time will be spent writing specs and how much you’ll be working with designers. Learn where the balance is between PMs, designers, and engineers in making product decisions. (Location 279)

During implementation, the product manager will also start gathering feedback and reporting bugs on the early versions of the product. Sometimes, a feature that looked good during the design phase will not work as well as expected once it’s used in the real world. (Location 290)

Dogfooding comes from the term “Eat your own dogfood,” and simply means using your own product yourself. (Location 292)

Another way to find out if a product will work before it’s launched is through usability studies. In a usability study, participants try out early prototypes of a new product or feature. (Location 296)

Prioritization is one of the product manager’s most important functions at this point; if the team were to fix every bug and build every new feature idea, the product would never launch. (Location 308)

Running through a launch checklist. There might be final approvals from key stakeholders like Legal or coordination steps with teams like Marketing and Operations. Making sure that the teams who will support the product going forward are prepared. For a web product this might be the customer service team; for a hardware product it could be the manufacturing team; for a service-based product it could be the operations team. Preparing for all the things that could go wrong. As the release nears, urgent issues inevitably pop up, and the PM thinks on her feet to fight the fires. (Location 313)

Product Managers are Project Managers. (Location 374)

While some product managers have project management as a large part of their job, most do not. Project managers are mostly concerned with timelines and coordination. While they might be responsible for gathering the project requirements, they don’t have much say in identifying and choosing the requirements. (Location 375)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/product-management #concept/project-management #domain/business #insight/definition #priority/high
  
For example, a marketing manager might come up with messaging and start a social media campaign, while a product manager comes up with new features and works with the engineers to launch them. (Location 385)

In fact, many tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Yahoo recruit product managers directly out of college. They’ve found that passion, intellect, a strong customer focus, and lots of energy can be a winning combination for great PMs. If you want to become a PM, don’t think that you have to take a different job first.

Many PMs communicate ideas without specs, through conversations and drawing ideas on whiteboards. And some PMs fail because they write a spec but don’t follow through to make sure the team understood and implemented the ideas. (Location 397)

Product managers are able to reduce the number of meetings their teammates need to attend because they’re able to represent the team to other groups and find productive ways of communicating that don’t require meetings. (Location 405)

Not trusting the engineers’ estimates and promising other teams that the work will be done sooner than the engineers agree to is one of the fastest ways to ruin your relationship with the team. (Location 419)

As a PM, you’re responsible for the success or failure of your product, and no job is beneath you. If there’s work that no one wants to do, you need to find a way to get it done, even if that means doing it yourself. If you let the work slip by, no one else will make sure it gets caught. Project Managers and Program Managers Note: Microsoft has a role called Program Manager that is different from the Program Manager role at most other software companies, and is similar to the Product Manager role described earlier.

At Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Amazon, product managers are deeply involved in product strategy, deciding which direction to take the product and when to start new initiatives. PMs are expected to think about strategy (Location 494)

At Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Amazon, product managers are deeply involved in product strategy, deciding which direction to take the product and when to start new initiatives. PMs are expected to think about strategy for their teams, for example, which customers and areas to focus on. They’ll get advice and opinions from lots of people, but ultimately they need to present a compelling plan. (Location 494)

Help your team with something tangible early on. Most teams are a little bit suspicious of new PMs. They’re worried you’ll create busy work for them or slow them down in other ways. It doesn’t help that most of the work a PM does is behind the scenes, so your coworkers might not see how hard you work. You can counteract their fear by focusing on helping out your team when you’re new. Look around your team to find some grunt work you can take off of someone’s hands, or do some research that people have been putting off (but really wish they had done). (Location 1223)

When reaching out to a mentor, be specific. Maybe you’re trying to build a case for your idea and reach out to someone who’s really persuasive to ask for help on how to frame your proposal. (Location 1267)

Another tip to get that tipping point early on is to demonstrate value to people. Make it so the fact that you’re there is driving something that wouldn’t happen if you weren’t there. (Location 1334)

Figure out your own framework and principles for how you make decisions, and communicate that as often as you can. You start developing these frameworks, but sometimes they’re not obvious to people around you. (Location 1340)

Another example is that I try to make sure that, as much as possible, when you open the mobile app, you get straight to the value with as few bumps as possible. So if we’re adding a feature that won’t be used by everyone, we avoid welcome screens and tutorials. My position is always: don’t show it up front. You can educate people, but don’t put the bump up front. Over time we realized that if you stick to that principle, you find other ways of doing things. So, we have shortcuts for power users. But we’ll only show in-app hints and popups if we know for sure that you’re interested in the feature. We wait until you used a feature in the non-shortcut way and used it enough that our popup hint about the shortcut will make sense to you. (Location 1351)
