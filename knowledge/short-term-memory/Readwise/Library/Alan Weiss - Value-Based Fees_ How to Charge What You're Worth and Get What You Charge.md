I believe in two aspects of consulting very strongly.First, you can’t help others until you help yourself.Consequently, unless you’re at least comfortable and secure fnancially, it’s diffcult to engage in pro bono work, to contribute to charities, and to help others to achieve their goals (Page 1)

And when you come right down to it, there’s a third aspect: Clients truly believe that they get what they pay for. No buyer ever bragged about being successful in capturing the cheapestxvii (Page 1)

For our purposes here, and for your purposes in terms of future success, “value” pertains to the quality and power of the results delivered. There is no value in a training program, a book, a focus group, a strategy session, a coaching engagement, unless there is a demonstrable tangible and/or intangible result of quality and pragmatic application. By “intangible” I refer to ego fulfillment, aesthetics, comfort, security, and so forth. Not all value is monetized, and in fact some of the greatest value is intangible, such as an improvement in self-esteem or closer relationships and intimacy (Page 3)

As we continue, please bear in mind that this type of thinking is a question of “mind-set. ” You have to believe that the result is the key, and not arbitrary “deliverables,” those darlings of the human resource crowd, or the time required. Cole Porter, Salvatore Dali, Thomas Alva Edison never worried about the time required to create value (Page 3)

However, there is a second aspect about this mind-set that is overarching: Charging by a time unit is unethical. I mean that as harshly as it’s written. (Page 3)

results they create. I don’t believe anyone ever asked Picasso how long it took to paint Guernica. Some expert valuations place it at a worth of $200 million. That is not a typo. At a $1,000 an hour, an incalculable fortune in Picasso’s time, he’d need 200,000 hours to equal the $200 million price by the hour. That’s about 22 years. He lived to 91, so perhaps working round-the-clock he might have done it (Page 4)

That agricultural transformation, as well as ego fulfillment and including great results not based on time, are a function of an abundance mind-set. (Page 4)

It’s insufficient to possess abundance. One must be willing to use it. We must move from a poverty and scarcity mentality to an abundance mentality. If the farmer with a surplus decided it was best to keep it and protect it for that proverbial “rainy day,” there would be nothing with which to pay for a tutor or fence repair. And some people, no matter what their income or savings or prospects, act as if they’re poor (Page 4)

The abundance mind-set is not merely about money. It’s also about time, information, volunteerism, support, and so forth. In other words, an abundance mentality is denoted by generosity. The most successful people I know are also among the most generous I know (Page 6)

But if we charge by the day, for example, we make the most money by staying as long as we can. That is an ethical conflict.Moreover, the client shouldn’t have to make an investment decision each time the client feels we may be needed. And our presence is often disruptive, distracting, and costs still more because of travel and lodging needs (Page 8)

I can prove anything on a double-axis chart,4 but the matrix in Figure 1.2 happens to hold true. As you can see in the figure, the ideal relationship occurs when buyer commitment to the project (and to you) is high and your fee is high. If buyer commitment is high and your fee is low, you are wasting an opportunity. If buyer commitment is low and your fee is low, you will, at best, create an indifferent sale. And when fees are high but commitment is low, you will be shown the door. My estimate is that most consultants (Page 9)

Buyers who merely comply may be seen at first blush as easy to work with, but they are actually land mines waiting for some weight to trigger them. That’s because they hold the consultant responsible for everything. They believe that you are doing something to them or for them or at them, but certainly not with them (Page 10)

Compliance is dangerous because the buyer usually takes no inherent responsibility for the project but rather abdicates to the consultant. I’ve never found a project that a consultant can unilaterally implement successfully, since consultants have responsibility but no real authority.(When that dynamic is reversed, it’s the sign of a very poor implementation scheme. ) (Page 10)

Consulting projects should be true partnerships between the consultant and the economic buyer. This begins prior to the proposal being signed and is an integral aspect of obtaining high fees. A merely compliant buyer will grudgingly or apathetically go along with the implementation but will do so at the lowest possible fee. The head is involved but not the gut (remember: logic makes people think, but emotion makes them act). Large fees are (Page 10)

The buyer’s commitment to outcomes and to his or her role in the partnership being formed to reach those outcomes is the key determinant of high fees. Buyers who are too willing to go along with your recommendations are as potentially fatal as those who dig in their heels after you’ve said hello (Page 11)

dependent on emotional buy-in, and that must be achieved in the relationship aspect of the consulting sequence, well prior to the actual closing of business. This is why patience in formulating the right relationship is more important than attempting to make a “fast sale. ” The former is a partnership where fees are academic; the latter is a unilateral benefit where fees are often the main point of contention. The buyer’s commitment to outcomes and to his or her role in the partnership being formed to reach those outcomes is the key determinant of high fees.

There is no brand as powerful as your name, although strong company brands can also serve quite well. When a potential client says, “Get me Jane Jones” or “Get me the Teambuilder,” that client is articulating a clear imperative: Don’t go shopping, don’t compare prices, and don’t issue a request for proposals; just get me that person I’ve heard so much about.(That is far superior to the buyer saying, “Get me a great leadership consultant” and your name is one of several in the hat (Page 14)

When the buyer simply views the consultant as another vendor providing certain expertise, the cost of acquisition becomes the key focus, because this is a commodity purchase (Who can provide the cheapest computer monitors per our specifications?).However, when the buyer’s self-image and role are as a partner in the consulting process, the decision becomes one of return on investment, and the clearer the outcomes (under the conceptual agreement discussed earlier) and the more dramatic, the higher the investment that is justified (Page 16)

These are some of the key factors in shared success: • A “we” mentality from the first contact with the prospect • Literature, web sites, and promotional materials that talk about partnering and shared responsibilities • A formal description of “joint accountabilities” in the proposal itself7 • A strong focus on outcomes and business results, not on tasks or deliverables • Ample opportunity for the buyer and other key people to take credit and to bask in the success • Candor in tackling inevitable problems and setbacks • The consultant’s being seen as an object of interest and center of expertise in the field (Page 17)

really doesn’t matter what the organization believes. What matters is what the current and future buyers believe.

H A P T E R R O I • One has to develop a philosophy about fees. They are not a “necessary evil” or a “dirty part of the job,” but rather a wonderful and appropriate exchange for the superb value you are delivering to the client. That exchange has a long tradition and represents the highest ethical canon of modern capitalism: agreed payment for agreed value. • Buyers tend to believe that they get what they pay for, and higher fees actually convey higher quality for most buyers. Higher fees also guarantee a higher level of buyer commitment, and commitment, not compliance, is key to producing a return-on-investment mentality rather than a cost-reducing mentality (Page 18)

Brands tend to raise buyers’ perception of quality still higher, which is why strategic marketing is an essential aspect of the consultant’s repertoire. • The consultant must anticipate and plan to overcome objections about how other, less enlightened consultants have charged, are charging, or will charge. That is, literally, neither here nor there. • Leaving money on the table is the equivalent of burning money—you will never, ever recover it, and we are talking millions of dollars over one’s career. • Finally, shared success—understood from the outset and achieved at the conclusion—is vital to the belief in consultant worth as part of a partnership with the buyer (Page 19)

First of all, the consultant only makes money when physically present or able to demonstrate that time is being expended somehow, somewhere for the client. This tends to compel the consultant to do the following: • Maximize, not minimize, the number of physical activities (focus groups, interviews, observations, meetings, and so on) • Accept peripheral assignments that may not be integral—or even important—to the actual project • Encourage and not discourage scope creep, since there is no penalty for blurring the project boundaries • Recommend nonessential tasks that don’t contribute to results but do contribute to billable hours3 (Page 27)

Conflicts with Client Purchasing Policies Alanism: A client should not have to make an investment decision every time the client believes the consultant may be of help. Most organizations have policies for dealing with “vendors,” and once you quote time-based fees, you will become no less a vendor than the plumber or the computer repair guy. • In putting yourself in the same category as other hourly vendors, you are asking the client to treat you differently by not requiring a limit on hours or by not adhering to company hourly billing policies.(“We never pay trainers more than $2,500 a day. ” “But I’m not a trainer. ” “You’re in the same category.”) • A good purchasing manager or vendor coordinator is paid to extract the best possible rates from vendors.Consequently, they will always try to minimize your time rates, and you will be in danger of pitting your28 Value-Based Fees (Page 28)

Alanism: Money is not a resource, it’s a priority. The idea is to be such a high priority with such a great ROI that the client reallocates funds to you and away from something else. (Page 29)

As projects unfold, something has to give: Either the client will have to come up with additional funds to pay for more hours, or the consultant will have to leave work undone (or work free of charge). Why on earth get into that position (Page 30)

The buyer and consultant are in an adversarial position, despite working together, presumably as partners, on the same goals. One is trying to minimize involvement, and the other is trying to maximize it. Yet the point should be active collaboration toward goals, not concern about the methodology or involvement to reach the goals (Page 30)

The buyer will want to minimize time, requiring the consultant to use fewer resources, make fewer visits, or narrow the scope. All of this may be highly detrimental to the quality of the investigation. (Page 30)

The buyer will want to minimize hourly rates, which often forces the consultant to make concessions.This, in turn, has two consequences: it endangers the “magic formula” based on the consultant’s earnings needs calculations, and it tells the buyer that the consultant has padded the fees and prompts even the most benign of buyers to wonder, “How low can this person go?” (I can name that tune in two notes.

It is absolutely crazy to adapt any billing scheme that can place a cap on your income. Time unit billing does just that. The only good reason for deliberately making less money is the urge to work less, and even there, I have a hard time believing that you must also make less money if you’re smart (Page 32)

An inherent problem in the lunacy of time-and-materials billing is that we educate the client incorrectly from the first meeting. Buyers are willing to believe that we operate in certain ways—just as the client does—and that those methods of operating will somehow have to be accommodated. (Page 37)

Use the following as a checklist to assess your own effectiveness in educating buyers. Prospect Education Checklist 1. Never quote a fee before project objectives and their value to the client are stipulated (we’ll discuss this in a bit).2. Don’t quote any time unit basis at all.3. Explain to the client, if pressed, that single, value-based fees are in the client’s best interests.4. Resist comparison to other consultants by pointing out that your potential client probably also operates differently in many respects from his or her own competitors.5. Never commit to arbitrary amounts of time for the accomplishment of objectives.6. Focus on results, not tasks.7. Never accept a prospect’s conclusion—stated or implied—that you will constantly be onsite or that you’re available “on call. ” 8. Emphasize results, not deliverables; in fact, minimize deliverables.9. Don’t accept contingency fees or “pay for performance”; you’re not a seal. Variables are often outside your control, and besides, you’re being paid for your best advice. It’s up to the client to implement it effectively.10. Provide value immediately. Shift the focus to how much value you provide, not how much work there is to be done. (Page 38)

Two parties are concerned about maximizing results—you and the buyer. But only one of you is concerned about maximizing your fees. If you emphasize the former, the latter will occur. But if you treat these as two separate considerations with the buyer, that person will try to maximize the former and minimize the latter every time. Wouldn’t you (Page 39)

Fees are based on perceived value. That perceived value is in the eyes and the cerebellum of the buyer.Consequently, the buyer’s perception of value is the first point of attack for a consultant who wishes to maximize income (Page 39)

Psychologically, people believe they get what they pay for.Consequently, there is tremendous power in helping the buyer stipulate his or her perceived value from the project and then working to maximize that perception (Page 40)

Here are some basic questions to use to help the buyer arrive at some measure of value for any given project. You don’t need to ask these interrogation-style, but it is a good idea to have them written somewhere and work them conversationally into the discussion until you’re comfortable that you’ve obtained a clear expression of value. Thirteen Questions for Establishing Value with the Buyer 1. What will be the difference in your organization at the conclusion of this project? 2. What if you did nothing? 3. What if this project failed (or have these attempts failed in the past)? 4. What will you be able to do that you can’t do now? 5. What will be the effect on revenues (sales, profits, market share, and so on)? 6. What will be the difference for your reputation (image, standing, stature, and so on)? 7. What are the three greatest impacts of the result of this project’s success? (People love to think in threes. ) 8. What will your boss’s reaction be to this success? (Even economic buyers have a boss; sometimes it’s the board. ) 9. What will this mean to you personally? 10. What peripheral and secondary value do you see accruing to this project (Page 40)

Value is often a function of not agreeing, not being supportive, and not being a “yes person. ” How willing are you to disagree, question basic premises, and refuse impossible expectations?Finally, the MBS creates rising expectations, which means that the buyer is prone to improve his or her condition through perceived high-value assistance. Why purchase a less expensive model when the (perceived) better one is only a few hundred dollars more per month on the lease payment? Why take a basic consulting approach when a more sophisticated one is available? That presupposes that a more sophisticated one is available, meaning that higher fees will always depend on the buyer’s seeing a set of options. The ultimate consultant always provides options for the client’s review so that the buyer can determine just how much value is available in terms of differing investments. Offering options—a choices of yeses—moves the buyer psychologically from “Should I do this?” to “How should I do this?” You’ve just increased your odds of a high-fee sale by at least 50 percent. A consultant once asked me, “Aren’t we ethically compelled to provide every possible assistance to meet the client’s objectives?” Unequivocally no. We must meet the client’s objectives. But if the client’s objective is, say, “increasing sales closing rates,” then conducting industry-wide benchmarking studies or longitudinal analyses for two years or 360-degree feedback on 42 Value-Based Fees (Page 42)

C H A P T E R R O I • Supply and demand is for commodities, not consultants. Your supply will always exceed demand, and that tells you something about the inherent stupidity of this bromide. • There are legitimate and obvious ethical reasons not to use time units for billing bases. • Profitability should not be arbitrarily delimited by finite measures of time, materials, deliverables, or costs. • Other professions do it incorrectly. Why would you want to emulate them? • The buyer is educable, and you are the teacher. Don’t abdicate that huge responsibility. The average attorney’s income is barely above $100,000 annually. Successful people drive cars that cost more than that. What model are you using as your income paradigm, and what model car are you driving? (Page 43)
