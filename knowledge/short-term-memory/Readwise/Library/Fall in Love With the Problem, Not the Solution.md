have not failed 700 times. I have not failed once. I have succeeded in proving that those 700 ways will not work. When I have eliminated the ways that will not work, I will find the way that will work. —Thomas Edison (Location 244)

There are many reasons to start with the problem, in addition to increasing the likelihood of creating value. Another key reason: your story will be much simpler and more engaging; people understand the frustration and can connect to that. (Location 334)

When Google was in dialogue with us about acquiring Waze in 2013, their CEO Larry Page said that Google is interested in a “toothbrush model”—something that you would use twice a day, which is exactly what Waze is. Problems fit into a matrix with two axes: Total Addressable Market and Pain. (Location 360)

When thinking of a problem, look at this two-by-two matrix and ask yourself two questions: 1.   How big is the addressable market? How many people have this problem? How many businesses suffer from this issue? 2.   Then ask yourself the more important question: How painful is it? Pain can be measured by one or both of two factors: amplitude (really, really painful) or frequency (how often we suffer from it). Once you define your problem, go back to the matrix and see where it fits. (Location 364)

•    “Winners” are easy to understand but hard to find. They’re located in the upper right corner where there are many users and a high frequency of use (value)—think Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, and Waze. (Location 370)

•    “Niche” could be a very successful company, and one with potentially a huge impact for a very few (think of the cure for a rare medical syndrome). Or imagine that you build a marketplace of underutilized private jets. There is a lot of savings in this model, but it is relevant for a very small (and rich) addressable market. (Location 375)

The problem, not the solution, is nearly always the key motivation and reason for founding a start-up. Of course, there are successful companies that started without a problem, like the first social media start-ups or online gaming companies, but my approach is always to start there and not with the solution.
