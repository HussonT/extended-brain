The new companies, set free by “the Act of 1862” and by its imitators in other countries, were speeding the first great age of globalization. They were luring millions of people off the land, changing the way that people ate, worked, and played. They were erecting the first towering offices in Manhattan and despoiling the Belgian Congo. They were battling with labor unions and challenging politicians. “This is a government of the people, by the people and for the people no longer,” warned President Rutherford B. Hayes: “It is a government of corporations, by corporations and for corporations.” ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=57))

Hegel predicted that the basic unit of modern society would be the state, Marx that it would be the commune, Lenin and Hitler that it would be the political party. Before that, a succession of saints and sages claimed the same for the parish church, the feudal manor, and the monarchy. The big contention of this small book is that they have all been proved wrong. The most important organization in the world is the company: the basis of the prosperity of the West and the best hope for the future of the rest of the world.

Companies have proved enormously powerful not just because they improve productivity, but also because they possess most of the legal rights of a human being, without the attendant disadvantages of biology: they are not condemned to die of old age and they can create progeny pretty much at will.

There are two ways to define a company. The first is merely as an organization engaged in business: this definition, as we shall see, includes everything from informal Assyrian trading arrangements to modern leveraged buyouts. The second is more specific: the limited-liability joint-stock company is a distinct legal entity (so distinct, in fact, that its shareholders can sue it), endowed by government with certain collective rights and responsibilities.

From the beginning of economic life, businesspeople have looked for ways to share the risks and rewards of their activities. One of the fundamental ideas of medieval law was that “bodies corporate”—towns, universities, guilds—had a life beyond that of their members.

The most powerful economic power of the day finally brought together the three big ideas behind the modern company: that it could be an “artificial person,” with the same ability to do business as a real person; that it could issue tradable shares to any number of investors; and that those investors could have limited liability (so they could lose only the money they had committed to the firm).

Nowadays it is assumed that the causes of capitalism and companies are inseparable. Yet many of the earliest critics of the joint-stock company and the “subsidy” of limited liability were economic liberals, taking their cue from Adam Smith, who had derided them as antiquated and inefficient.

many Victorian liberals also worried whether professional managers could be trusted to act in the interests of the owner shareholders. They had a point: the potential conflict of interest between the “principals” who own companies and their “agents,” who run them, which was later dubbed the agency problem, has dogged the history of the company, from the mills of Lancashire to software start-ups in Palo Alto, with shareholders repeatedly trying to find ways to make managers’ interests the same as their own (most recently with share options) and managers usually wriggling out of them.

First, the company’s past is often more dramatic than its present. Modern business books may have macho titles such as Barbarians at the Gate and Only the Paranoid Survive, but early businessmen took risks with their lives as well as their fortunes. Send a fleet to the Spice Islands at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and you might be lucky if a third of the men came back alive. This was a time when competitive advantage meant blowing your opponents out of the water, when marketing meant supplying an English rose for the sultan’s harem (a London merchant of “honorable parentage” selflessly offered his daughter), and when your suppliers might put your head on a stick.

Those who fear the unparalleled might of Bill Gates could do with a little reading on J. P. Morgan. Today, the number of private-sector companies that a country boasts—the United States had 5½ million corporations in 2001, North Korea, as far as we can tell, none—is a better guide to its status than the number of battleships it can muster. It is also not a bad guide to its political freedom. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=151))

This leads to the third point. The company has been one of the West’s great competitive advantages. Of course, the West’s success owes much to technological prowess and liberal values. But Lowe and Gladstone ushered in an organization that has been uniquely effective in rendering human effort productive. The idea that the company itself was an enabling technology is something that liberal thinkers once understood instinctively.

Companies increase the pool of capital available for productive investment. They allow investors to spread their risk by purchasing small and easily marketable shares in several enterprises. And they provide a way of imposing effective management structures on large organizations.9 Of course, companies can ossify, but the fact that investors can simply put their money elsewhere is a powerful rejuvenator.

The much-vaunted idea that companies are now bigger than mere governments is, as we shall see, statistically fraudulent. Big companies are giving way to small ones, so much so, in fact, that an old question is now more pressing: What is the point of companies? That question was most succinctly answered back in 1937 by Ronald Coase, a young British economist. In an article called “The Nature of the Firm,” he argued that the main reason why a company exists (as opposed to individual buyers and sellers making ad hoc deals at every stage of production) is because it minimizes the transaction costs of coordinating a particular economic activity. Bring all the people in-house, and you reduce the costs of “negotiating and concluding a separate contract for each exchange transaction.” ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=177))

William Blackstone, the great eighteenth-century jurist, claimed that the honor of inventing companies “belongs entirely to the Romans.”7 They certainly created some of the fundamental concepts of corporate law, particularly the idea that an association of people could have a collective identity that was separate from its human components.

In the twelfth century, a slightly different form of organization emerged in Florence and other inland towns: the compagnia. These began as family firms, operating on the principle of joint liability: all partners were jointly liable to the value of their worldly goods (“to their cuff links,” as all-too-liable investing “names” at Lloyds of London would later put it). Given that the punishment for bankruptcy could be imprisonment or even servitude, it was vital that all the members of the organization should trust each other absolutely. The word compagnia is a compound of two Latin words (cum and panis) meaning “breaking bread together.” ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=272))

Perhaps as early as 1340, they introduced double-entry bookkeeping, largely to keep their foreign offices honest. A Genoese merchant would record money sent to his agent in Bruges as “paid” in his accounts, while the latter put down the amount as “received.” And rather than sending coins, the bigger merchants began to trust each other with letters of exchange—a business that Italian banks would dominate. Indeed, the compagnie were closely intertwined with the banchi (named after the banco, or bench, behind which Italian money lenders used to sit). In the Inferno (1314), Dante gleefully sent usurers to the seventh circle of hell to be tortured by a rain of fire, and in many cities bankers were forbidden, along with prostitutes, from receiving communion. Many banchi were little more than pawnbrokers, charging outrageous rates of interest (often above 40 percent a year). But the grossi banchi were sophisticated, well-capitalized international banks, able to settle bills of exchange in different cities. They lured rich investors away from real estate toward bank deposits (which were much more mobile in the event of a political crisis). And they helped to finance not just voyages and companies but even kingdoms. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=278))

“The Merchant of Prato” was something of a control freak: Datini recorded everything and told his managers to do the same. The business that emerges from the 150,000 letters, 500 ledgers, and 300 partnership agreements that he left behind often seems remarkably modern. The near-daily letters from the capo to his various fattori around Europe asking for news and numbers, their replying boasts and excuses, his reprimands (“You cannot see a crow in a bowl full of milk”), read a little like e-mail. There is the persistent need for lawyers, for the right papers, for up-to-date accounts. Promotions are awarded, employees trained, disgruntled partners appeased; all the while, Datini’s wife frets about her husband working too hard. Even his hard-won profits seem meagerly modern: all this hard labor eked out a mere 9 percent margin. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=312))

the early Middle Ages, jurists, elaborating on Roman and canon law, slowly began to recognize the existence of “corporate persons”: loose associations of people who wished to be treated as collective entities. These “corporate persons” included towns, universities, and religious communities, as well as guilds of merchants and tradesmen.

The most successful of the regulated companies was the Staple of London, which was founded in 1248 to control wool exports.19 In 1357, the Staple acquired the right to collect customs on wool exports in return for helping to finance Edward III’s French wars. In 1466, Henry VI granted the Staple authority over Calais (including the right to collect customs on woolen imports bound for the Continent) in return for similar financial help.

Chartered companies represented a combined effort by governments and merchants to grab the riches of the new worlds opened up by Columbus (1451–1506), Magellan (1480–1521), and Vasco da Gama (1469–1524). All of them were the lucky recipients of royal charters that gave them exclusive rights to trade with this or that bit of the world.

Whereas the English East India Company initially treated each voyage as a separate venture, with different shareholders, the VOC made all the voyages part of a twenty-one-year venture (something the English imitated a decade later). The VOC’s charter also explicitly told investors that they had limited liability. Dutch investors were the first to trade their shares at a regular stock exchange, founded in 1611, just around the corner from the VOC’s office. All the Amsterdam hub needed to prove its capitalistic credentials was a market crash, which duly arrived with tulip mania in 1636–1637.

The day-to-day management was entrusted to the Court of Directors, twenty-four men all elected by the General Court. The governor and his deputy, assisted by a growing number of accountants, clerks, and cashiers, worked through seven committees specializing in accounting, buying, correspondence, shipping, finance, warehousing, and private trade. The Court of Directors also supervised the overseas network of resident “factors” who managed the local trading posts, or factories.

Economic liberals produced a different array of charges. Adam Smith (1723–1790), who was obsessed with the East India Company’s abuses in Bengal, had two basic complaints. First, he disliked the fact that chartered companies possessed monopolies (albeit ones that were being diluted, even as he scribbled away, by both licensed and clandestine competition). For him, the chartered companies were “either burdensome or useless” and they “either mismanaged or confined” trade.30 Second, he thought that joint-stock companies were inherently less efficient than sole traders. In particular, he worried about the “agency” problem: hired managers would not bring the same “anxious vigilance” to their firms’ interests as owner-managers. “Negligence and profusion, therefore must always prevail.…” ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=623))

As for Smith’s second charge—that the chartered firms were less efficient than owner-managed companies—this, too, is open to dispute. For all its faults, the East India Company demonstrated that when information was scarce and trust at a premium, a company could be more efficient than individual agents trading in the market. The Company’s network of trusted factors compiled information that could never be gathered by any private businessman rooted in one local market (its ledger book took two hundred pages just to list the goods purchased in one voyage). And it used this knowledge to build a complex trading system to its own advantage. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=634))

Alongside the huge, established sociétés anonymes, which had to be authorized by the government, a new form of business was made available to entrepreneurs in 1807—a partnership with transferable shares, the société en commandite par actions. This granted limited liability to its sleeping (inactive) partners and only needed to be registered.15 Another pioneer was Sweden, which gave legal recognition to joint-stock firms as early as 1848.

Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, the leaders of the world’s most important economy labored to free up its commercial laws. Parliament made the currency convertible to gold (1819), relaxed the restrictive Combination labor laws (1824), opening the East India Company’s markets to competition (1834), and eventually repealed the protectionist Corn Laws (1846). They also began to tackle the issue of company law. In 1825, parliament finally repealed the vexatious Bubble Act. Reformers called for the statutory recognition of unincorporated companies, but conservative judges were skeptical. Lord Eldon, for example, maintained that it was an offense against the common law to try to act as a corporation without a private act of parliament or a royal charter.16 Despite attempts to speed up the process of obtaining charters, it could still be expensive—one estimate put the cost at £402—and fraught with political risk.17 ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=777))

The 1844 act allowed companies to dispense with the need to get a special charter, and be incorporated by the simple act of registration.22 But it did not include the crucial ingredient of automatic limited liability. Limited liability was still anathema to many liberals. Adam Smith, remember, had been adamant that the owner-managed firm was a purer economic unit: the only way the joint-stock firm could compete was through the “subsidy” of limited liability.

Some of the industrialists who had helped get rid of the Corn Laws were suspicious.23 Surely entrepreneurs could raise the necessary sums by tapping family savings and plowing back the firm’s earnings? Wouldn’t limited liability just impose the risk of doing business on suppliers, customers, and lenders (a complaint that modern economists later echoed)? And wouldn’t it attract the lowest sort of people into business? The majority of established manufacturers, most of whom were located far from London, were against the new measure.24 So, according to Walter Bagehot, were the rich, who thought the poor would reap the biggest rewards.

Pleydell-Bouverie was then replaced by Robert Lowe, who masterminded the landmark Joint Stock Companies Act of 1856 (which removed the qualifications of the Limited Liability Act). If anyone deserves the title “father of the modern company,” it is Lowe. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=839))

Lowe’s 1856 act allowed businesses to obtain limited liability with “a freedom amounting almost to license.”29 Banks and insurers were excluded; but there were no minimums for share capital. All that was needed was for seven people to sign a Memorandum of Association, for the company to register its office, and for the company to advertise its status by calling itself “ltd.” ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=852))

Two points emerge clearly from all this activity. First, no matter how much modern businessmen may presume to the contrary, the company was a political creation. The company was the product of a political battle, not just the automatic result of technological innovation.34 And the debate forged in mid-nineteenth-century Britain has shadowed the institution ever since: Is the company essentially a private association, subject to the laws of the state but with no greater obligation than making money, or a public one which is supposed to act in the public interest?

Second, the little republics plainly had a political and social impact in the societies that spawned them. As Peter Drucker puts it, “This new ‘corporation,’ this new Société Anonyme, this new Aktiengesellschaft, could not be explained away as a reform, which is how the new army, the new university, the new hospital presented themselves. It clearly was an innovation.… It was the first autonomous institution in hundreds of years, the first to create a power center that was within society yet independent of the central government of the national state.” ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=887))

In 1840, businesspeople expected the work of coordinating their own activities with those of other businesspeople over a region as vast as the United States to be done by the market. Nobody would have thought that a single vast organization could coordinate, say, the demand for women’s undergarments in Oregon with the production of cotton in New England.

The behemoths that were created in this period helped found modern America. It was their jobs that lured people from all over the world to America’s big cities; their abuses that hastened the development of labor unions and antitrust law; their indifference to the environment that meant that sunlight could hardly penetrate the smoky air of Pittsburgh and Chicago; and their capacity to produce wealth that posed questions about inequality and meritocracy.

Why did these extraordinary organizations take off when they did? Alfred Chandler has provided the classic answer: “Modern business enterprise” became viable “only when the visible hand of management proved to be more efficient than the invisible hand of market forces.” For that to happen, a new system of transport and communication was necessary.

The new trust acquired a single headquarters—at 26 Broadway in New York City—and immediately set about rationalizing the oil industry. The company’s costs fell dramatically, from 1.5 cents for refining a gallon of oil to 0.5 cents. “The Standard was an angel of mercy,” Rockefeller argued, “reaching down from the sky, and saying, ‘Get into the ark. Put in your old junk. We’ll take all the risks!’ ”18 Soon a quarter of the world’s production of kerosene came from just three giant refineries.

Watson realized that Standard Oil of Ohio had been violating its state charter by handing over control to out-of-state trustees. Ignoring a series of heavy-handed threats and, it is said, fulsome bribes, he sued, and in 1892, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in his favor, renouncing the trust agreement and saying that the trust had created a monopoly.

The New Jersey law allowed for holding companies—umbrella companies that own a controlling proportion of the voting shares of subsidiary companies. In 1899, after a number of legal feints, Standard Oil of New Jersey became the oil giant’s formal holding company, controlling stock in nineteen large and twenty-one smaller companies.

Standard was only one of many trusts and big businesses to move to New Jersey. By 1901, two-thirds of all American firms with $10 million or more of capital were incorporated in the state, allowing New Jersey to run a budget surplus of almost $3 million by 1905 and paying for a rash of new public works. Inevitably, other states fought back. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVAL2&location=1068))

But the big winner of this particular “race to the bottom” would be Delaware.

But the consolidation of capital prompted a consolidation of labor. The National Labor Union appeared in 1866. Another organization, the Knights of Labor, boasted 700,000 workers at its peak in 1886. The 1890s marked a maturing of the unions as well as a maturing of big business—and a series of bloody confrontations between the two.
