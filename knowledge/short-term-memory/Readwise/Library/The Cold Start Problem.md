This was a senior group of executives, but the granularity and level of detail was incredible. But this was a requirement to run a complex, hyperlocal network like Uber where supply and demand depended on the dynamics of popular neighborhoods and frequent “lanes”—like Marina and the Financial District—that tended to be poorly served by other transportation options.

In my several years there, it was unusual to ever hear about an aggregate number—like total trips or total active riders—except as a big vanity milestone at a company all-hands. Those aggregate metrics were regarded as mostly meaningless. Instead, the discussion was always centered on the dynamics of each individual network, which could be nudged up or down independently of each other, with increased marketing budget, incentive spend for either drivers or riders, product improvements, or on-the-ground (Location 97)

We need to be able to answer the basics: What are network effects, really? How do they apply to your business? How do you know if your product has them—and which other products don’t? Why are they so hard to create, and how do you create them? Can you add a network to your product after the fact? How do they impact your business metrics, at the tactical level? Is Metcalfe’s Law actually right, or should you apply something else to your strategy? Will your network fail or will it succeed? Does your competitor have network effects, and if so, what is the best way to compete with them? (Location 198)

But why has it also been so critical to launch products in the right way? To get your product in the hands of influencers, or high school students, or aspirational technology companies—if B2B—if all that matters is the product? What’s the right way to launch, and what’s the sequence of ways to expand? How do you build network effects in your product? How do you know when network effects are kicking in, and if they are strong enough to create defensibility? How do you pick the right metrics to optimize to achieve viral growth, reengagement, defensibility, and other desired effects? What product features do you build to amplify network effects? When fraudsters, spammers, and trolls inevitably show up, what’s the proper recourse? What have we seen other networks do in the past to combat the negative effects of a large, thriving network? And more generally, how do you keep scaling a network that’s already working, especially in the face of saturation, competition, and other negative dynamics? (Location 203)

What happens when two networked products compete—what makes one player win over another? Why did we see big networks often succumb to smaller ones? How do you launch new networks across new geographies and product lines, particularly in competitive markets? These are the most fundamental questions we can ask about network effects, and when you search for the answers—whether in books or online—there are only smatterings of actionable, pragmatic insights though there is plenty of high-level strategy.

A successful network effect requires both a product and its network, and that was true in the age of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, and true today. For Uber, the “product” is the app that people run on their phones, and the “network” refers to all the active users at any given time who are connecting with Uber to drive or ride. (Location 281)

Given these definitions, how do you tell if a product has a network effect, and, if yes, how strong is it? The questions to ask are simple: First, does the product have a network? Does it connect people with each other, whether for commerce, collaboration, communication, or something else at the core of the experience? And second, does the ability to attract new users, or to become stickier, or to monetize, become even stronger as its network grows larger? Does the user face a Cold Start Problem where retention is low when there’s no other users? Note that the answers to these questions aren’t binary—generally not yes or no—but rather in shades of gray. And that’s what makes network effects so much fun to study. (Location 325)

Said plainly, each time a user joins an app with a network behind it, the value of the app is increased to n^2. That means if a network has 100 nodes and then doubles to 200, its value more than doubles—it quadruples. (Location 418)

To win a market, it’s important to build many, many more networks to expand into the market—but how does this happen, at scale? Luckily, an important dynamic kicks in: as a network grows, each new network starts to tip faster and faster, so that the entire market is more easily captured. (Location 571)

This is where the classical definition of a “network effect” is wrong. I redefine it so that it’s not one singular effect, but rather, three distinct, underlying forces: the Acquisition Effect, which lets products tap into the network to drive low-cost, highly efficient user acquisition via viral growth; the Engagement Effect, which increases interaction between users as networks fill in; and finally, the Economic Effect, which improves monetization levels and conversion rates as the network grows.

A larger network and a smaller network in any given market have distinctly different strategies—think of it as a David strategy versus a Goliath strategy. The upstart has to pick off niche segments within a larger network, and build atomic networks that are highly defensible with key product features, and, when applicable, better economics and engagement. The incumbent, on the other hand, uses its larger size to drive higher monetization and value for its top users, and fast-following any niches that seem to be growing quickly. (Location 624)

When you start a new product with network effects, the first step is to build a single, tiny network that’s self-sustaining on its own. You just need one to get started. However, building even a single network is very hard. So I’m going to start by telling you the story of a product—and its network—that failed. (Location 653)

First, I start with the principal dilemma, which I call “Anti-Network Effects.” It’s a myth that network effects are all powerful and positive forces—quite the opposite. Small, sub-scale networks naturally want to self-destruct, because when people show up to a product and none of their friends or coworkers are using it, they will naturally leave. What solves this? “The Atomic Network”—the smallest network where there are enough people that everyone will stick around. (Location 762)

However, the most important part of any early network is attracting and retaining “The Hard Side” of a network—the small percentage of people that typically end up doing most of the work within the community. For example, most of Wikipedia was written by a tiny percentage of prolific editors. A small group of drivers, about 5 percent of Uber’s users, carry most of the load within the rideshare marketplace—riders are numerous but engage less frequently and deeply. (Location 767)

To attract the hard side, you need to “Solve a Hard Problem”—design a product that is sufficiently compelling to the key subset of your network. Tinder did this for the most attractive users in its network, which I’ll use as an example. (Location 767)

For the first user of Slack within a workplace, the experience won’t be great if there are zero other users. But what if they encounter one other coworker also using Slack—is that enough? Or two? How many do you really need? (Location 806)

Slack works with just 2 people, but it takes 3 to make it really work. There are long-running 3 person groups that are stable—that’s the minimum required to be called a customer. (Location 808)

This idea can be generalized to a wide variety of products beyond Slack. How many users does your network need before the product experience becomes good? The way to answer this is for companies to do an analysis on the size of their networks (on the X-axis) plotted against a set of important engagement metrics (on the Y-axis). For Uber, this chart showed that more drivers generally meant a lower waiting time, and thus more users—at least up to some point. (Location 816)

Conceptually, understanding that a product has a critical threshold is helpful, but practically speaking, what do you do with this metric? For new products, it’s important to have a hypothesis for the size of your network even before you begin. Communication apps can be 1:1, so the network is small, and you can plan accordingly. Contrast that to products that are highly asymmetrical, with content creators and viewers, or marketplaces with buyers and sellers—these are likely to require a much bigger number to hit the threshold, and require a much bigger effort to get started. The size of an initial network helps determine a launch strategy. (Location 846)

The solution to the Cold Start Problem starts by understanding how to add a small group of the right people, at the same time, using the product in the right way. Getting this initial network off the ground is the key, and the key is the “atomic network”—the smallest, stable network from which all other networks can be built. (Location 862)

The networked product should be launched in its simplest possible form—not fully featured—so that it has a dead simple value proposition. The target should be on building a tiny, atomic network—the smallest that could possibly make sense—and focus on building density, ignoring the objection of “market size.” (Location 916)

The first step to launching an atomic network is to have a hypothesis about what it might look like. My advice: Your product’s first atomic network is probably smaller and more specific than you think. Not a massive segment of users, or a particular customer segment, or a city, but instead something tiny, maybe on the order of hundreds of people, at a specific moment in time. (Location 953)

Growing city by city, campus by campus, or team by team is a surprisingly powerful strategy. It leads to dense, organic connections of users that strengthen network effects across multiple dimensions: Engagement goes up, because users are more likely to find other relevant users. Viral growth goes up when prospective users of a product see that their friends and colleagues are all using the service. In the earlier example of Bank of America’s credit card launch, focusing on one city at a time made it more likely that customers would find local merchants that accepted this novel new method of payment.

There’s a big question at the heart of all of this: What does it take to build an atomic network in the first place? And why is it so hard? To answer this, I’ll start with an important sub-segment of every network that has to be made happy in order for it to function. (Location 986)

Even at the start of an atomic network, there is an important and surprising dynamic at play that only increases over time: there is a minority of users that create disproportionate value and as a result, have disproportionate power. This the “hard side” of your network. (Location 991)

For marketplaces, these are usually the sellers and providers who spend their entire day attracting users with their products and services. (Location 994)

A successful new product should be able to answer detailed questions: Who is the hard side of your network, and how will they use the product? What is the unique value proposition to the hard side? (And in turn, the easy side of the network.) How do they first hear about the app, and in what context? For users on the hard side, as the network grows, why will they come back more frequently and become more engaged? What makes them sticky to your network such that when a new network emerges, they will retain on your product? These are difficult answers, and require a deep understanding of the motivations of your users. (Location 1045)

In a widely read essay called “Creators, Synthesizers, and Consumers,” Bradley Horowitz, now a vice president of product at Google, described the 1 percent of users who create versus everyone else: 1% of the user population might start a group (or a thread within a group) 10% of the user population might participate actively, and actually author content whether starting a thread or responding to a thread-in-progress 100% of the user population benefits from the activities of the above groups (lurkers) (Location 1055)

You can imagine a pyramid, if you will, of internet technology or communications technology, where the base of the pyramid—the very broad base—is self-expression and communication. And that’s what Snapchat is really about. Talking to your friends, which is something everyone is comfortable doing. They just express how they feel. As the pyramid gets narrower, you have the next layer, which is status. Social media in its original construct is really about status, representing who you are, showing people that you’re cool, getting likes and comments. Those sorts of things. And that’s less accessible to the broad base of humanity, and has a narrower base of appeal. [There’s a] more limited frequency of engagement, because people only do some things that are cool once a week or once a month, and not every day. At the top of the pyramid, which I think is represented by TikTok, is really talent. People who have spent a couple hours learning a new dance, or think about a funny new creative way to tell a story. They’re really making media to entertain other people. I think that’s even narrower. . . . (Location 1066)

Thus the order of operations, at least for most consumer-facing marketplaces, is “supply, demand, supply, supply, supply.” While supply might be easy to get onto the network early on through subsidies, eventually it will become the bottleneck.

But there’s a mid-tier of successful people who are still building and hustling, who get fewer requests for intros but will actually take the meetings.

The Welcome Experience Invite-only mechanics provide a better “welcome experience” for new users as well. To explain why, imagine arriving at a large dinner party.

Mathematically, it tends to work even better than that—the most connected people tend to be invited earlier, and in turn they tend to invite other highly connected people.

If there aren’t enough new users showing up and interacting with others, the network might be too small—you might hit the Cold Start Problem. However, invite-only launches have been a key feature of many products precisely because for networked products, there are huge advantages. It allows the early network to gel as a community, develop a high density of connections, and grow organically via virality. Curating a High-Quality Network “Rate us 5 stars!” says the app. By now, we’ve all seen a screen like this in our favorite apps. Product categories like marketplaces, dating, app stores, and food delivery ask us to review and rate (with a five-star scale!) because they are categories where trust, safety, and high quality are key to the experience. Part of this is picking the people on the network, but the other is teaching users how to interact with each other and enforcing these “rules” within the product. Quality begets quality. Networked products in these categories can be magnetic to consumers on the quality vector, which is why companies often handpick them—another form of invite-only tactics—to curate the initial network. Ubercab—as it was initially called—started out as a black car service, with an app where you could hit a button and a limo would show up. The cofounders and senior executives would personally meet and onboard every driver in person before adding them onto the network. At the time, the young startup was dealing with licensed, professional limo drivers, but nevertheless the team decided it was important to explain the expectations for how the service worked, how to communicate with riders, how to deal with problems, and so on. As a bonus, it increased the rate of sign-up to activation—getting drivers on the road and taking trips. Although high-touch onboarding isn’t always scalable, it establishes cultural norms and a high-quality network that sets the tone for new users, and so sometimes the trade-off makes sense.

For networked products, the curation of the network—who’s on it, why they’re there, and how they interact with each other—is as important as its product design.

Come for the tool, stay for the network” is one of the most famous strategies for launching and scaling networks. Start with a great “tool”—a product experience that is useful even for one user as a utility. Then, over time, pivot the users into a series of use cases that tap into a “network”—the part where you collaborate, share, communicate, or otherwise interact with other users. (Location 1746)

At the intersection of the tool and network, eventually, a pivot has to happen. Mechanically, this happens in multiple ways: This could be as simple as Instagram’s decision to open the app to a home screen feed of photos from other users. As a tool, it might be more efficient to show its photo-editing interface first, but Instagram emphasizes the network to show the feed, popular photos, and people recommendations. (Location 1831)

So I devised a plan for making Van Camp’s Milk familiar. In a page ad, I inserted a coupon, good at any store for a ten-cent can. We paid the grocer his retail price. For three weeks we announced that this ad would appear. At the same time we told the story of Van Camp’s Evaporated Milk. We sent copies of these ads to all grocers, and told them that every customer of theirs would receive one of these coupons. It was evident that they must have Van Camp’s Milk. Every coupon meant a ten-cent sale which, if they missed it, would go to a competitor. . . . The result was almost universal distribution, and at once. (Location 1908)

Using money as a growth lever can feel like a dangerous move, and it should only be executed at the right time. While establishing an initial network, it usually doesn’t make sense for an underresourced startup to throw a lot of money around to get started. Instead, teams are often better to focus on basics, like figuring out the right target market, and creating the initial product features. You need to nail the killer product, and prove that you can gain an atomic network, before reaching for the financial lever. (Location 1951)

Why Unprofitability Is Sometimes Smart All of the examples in this chapter—coupons, Uber, crypto, Microsoft, etc.—involve the use of up-front efforts to bootstrap the network. One critique of subsidizing networks in this way is that it’s like “selling a dollar for ninety cents.” Yes, it would be ideal to be able to grow a network with positive unit economics from day one, but sometimes it’s just not possible. Or it might be too slow. A new networked product is better off taking on the risk of subsidizing the network up front, and then improving the economics over time. (Location 2020)

guaranteeing payments in a marketplace. At scale, it’s almost always the goal to reduce incentives once the market has been won. If the entire addressable market is active on your platform, you’ll no longer need to spend on acquisition costs. If you are the dominant player in the market, you may not have to spend on discounts aimed at competitors, or you may be so efficient at your spending that your competitors have to leave the market. What looks like unprofitability in the short term might lead to dominance in the long term, if the market reaches a Tipping Point in your favor. (Location 2029)

Only three sourcing strategies account for every B2B company’s very early growth. [These are: Personal network, Seek out customers where they are, Get press.] Thus, your choices are easy, yet limited. Almost every B2B business both hits up their personal network and heads to the places their potential customers were spending time. The question isn’t which of these two routes to pursue, but instead how far your own network will take you before you move on. It’s a huge advantage to have a strong personal network in B2B, which you can also build by bringing a connector investor or joining an incubator such as YC.

“The Acquisition Effect,” on the other hand, is the network effect that powers the acquisition of new customers into your product—in other words, viral growth. Products are inherently viral when people bring their friends and colleagues into a network simply by using it—as Dropbox, messaging apps, and social networks do. I’ll talk about how the Acquisition Effect works, and how to best amplify its impact. And finally, I’ll introduce the third of the trio of network effects, (Location 2403)

“The Economic Effect.” Network effects can help improve business models over time, in the form of improved feed algorithms, increased conversion rates, premium pricing, and more. (Location 2406)

Three Systems Underlying the Network Effect Let’s start with a surprising idea that goes against the grain of industry jargon: the network effect is not one effect. Instead, the network effect is a broader umbrella term that can be broken down into a trio of underlying forces: the Acquisition network effect, the Engagement network effect, and the Economic network effect.

The types of projects that amplify the Acquisition Effect are oriented around viral growth: referral features that reward users when they invite others, tapping into contacts to create suggestions for who to add to an app, and improving conversion along the key moments in the invitation experience.

The “Engagement Effect” describes how a denser network creates higher stickiness and usage from its users—it is a more specific form of the classic description of network effects that I covered at the beginning of the book, “the more users that join the network, the more useful it gets.” (Location 2441)

The “Economic Effect” is the ability for a networked product to accelerate its monetization, reduce its costs, and otherwise improve its business model, as its network grows. Workplace products, for example, often convert to higher tiers of pricing as the number of knowledge workers using them grows within a company. The more workers that adopt a product, the more advanced features they might want to upgrade into, particularly when the features are collaborative in nature—like Slack charging for the ability to search messages from all users across the organizations.

I use Engagement, Acquisition, and Economic network effects as the core taxonomy for the reason that they map to the key outputs that product teams care most about: active users and revenue, and the leading indicators to these metrics. (Location 2457)

The relationship between these inputs and outputs is just arithmetic. Here is what’s often called the “Growth Accounting Equation,” which shows how these key metrics relate for active users: Gain or loss in active users = New + Reactivated − Churned (Location 2462)

Then based on the delta of each time period, you can figure out if you’ll gain or lose active users: This month’s actives = Last month’s actives + gain or loss (Location 2464)

The key is to target relevant users with messaging or incentives, or otherwise to try out new use cases over time. This moves them from low engagement into high engagement. (Location 2532)

The levers you use to increase the engagement of an infrequent user are different than deepening engagement for a power user. Early users might just need a few more connections to colleagues at their company. Power users might need to discover advanced features on search, recruiting, and creating groups, so that they have new and more powerful ways to connect with people. Segmenting our users gives us the granularity to connect the right features and user education to impact their usage. (Location 2545)

For a social or communication product, the loop often starts with a content creator posting or sending content. The content is then sent to everyone they are connected to, and depending on the size of the network, they get a nice stream of likes and comments back. That’s the payoff that keeps them going.

The Escape Velocity phase is about accelerating these loops, by making each stage of the loop perform better. For a marketplace listing, how might you make creating a listing easier? How might you make sure more potential buyers see the listing? Can the purchase process be one click, so that the conversion rates are higher, and the seller sees more purchases? For a workplace chat product, how do you make sure the right people are in the channel where you post your content? How do you create easy, positive feedback to encourage people to continue participating—whether that’s emojis, likes, or something else? (Location 2584)
