The idea for salesforce.com had been simmering since 1996 when I was a senior vice president at Oracle.

“He who is quick tempered can be insulted,” Sun Tzu explained in the Art of War. These four checkpoints can help you stay cool—and retain your power—even in the most heated situations: • Stay in the present moment. • Observe your feelings. Do not become your feelings. Be aware of your reactions. • Do not take on others’ feelings, but listen to others—and yourself. • Ask yourself, “How should I handle this? Should I react at all?” (Location 459)

What I learned from Larry: • Always have a vision. • Be passionate. • Act confident, even when you’re not. • Think of it as you want it, not as it is! • Don’t let others sway you from your point of view. • See things in the present, even if they are in the future. (We joked that Larry got his tenses confused because he would talk about things that hadn’t happened yet as if they had. This taught me that a successful leader is one who is always thinking about the future, not just the present. Wayne Gretzky famously put it another way: “Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.”) (Location 540)

At a cost of about $600,000 (the B-52s were $250,000 alone), the event wasn’t inexpensive, but it drew more than fifteen hundred attendees and earned us a firestorm of invaluable press. Most important, the audience and the press remembered the story of change we were disseminating. (Location 650)

Given these concerns, even the people on the salesforce.com team believed that moving forward with this slogan and logo was a disastrous idea. In fact, the staff tried to ignore it, hoping that it would disappear. Although research and logic were behind some of their concerns, I felt that their arguments were overruled by the most important rule in marketing—the necessity to differentiate your brand. Our differentiators were ease of use, a business model of shared risk, and low-risk commitment—everything that software was not. (Location 689)

To ensure that everyone was on the same page (literally), our PR firm, OutCast Communications, produced a two-sided laminated card. It was a marketing cheat sheet that stated in one sentence what we did. It also provided information about the benefits of our service, our newest customers and partners, and our most recent awards. With this card, we leveraged everyone—from developers to engineers to quality assurance people—as integral parts of our marketing organization. (Location 741)

Salesforce.com only acknowledged one competitor—the market leader. After all, that was the only position for which we were vying. Furthermore, it cast us in the right role as the underdog and the visionary. It’s always wise to play the visionary card. Everyone roots for you. If there is no Goliath in your industry, go after the status quo. (Location 755)

One idea alone is a tactic, but if it can be executed a number of different ways, it becomes a great strategy. Because the guerilla tactic of directly leveraging the activities of our competition worked so well, we repeated it and made it one of our marketing strategies. I learned this idea from the marketing classic Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, by Al Ries and Jack Trout. (Location 795)

Siebel executives did not see what was obvious (that we were trying to rattle them), and as the company began defending itself and acknowledging salesforce.com, we chipped into its airtime. The press began to see this fight as an increasingly interesting story, and that further legitimized us. The tail started to wag the dog. At this point, we had already won. (Location 839)

A large part of our marketing and PR strategy is making sure that we always remain relevant. One of the ways we do this is by making ourselves available to discuss the direction of the industry. We don’t just sit around and wait for someone to call. If something happens that I can leverage, I immediately send a journalist an e-mail with my comments or “leak” an internal memo. (Location 876)

I’m a believer in the power of public relations.

A friend introduced me to MC Hammer, who visited our San Francisco office (wearing a business suit, not the trademark Hammer pants) and shared his “Street Team” concept: that of building local networks of people to back you. At the time, I didn’t know how salesforce.com Street Teams would work in action, but I thought that MC Hammer was a creative genius and that this unconventional idea was worth investigating.

Street Teams: Make Customers Part of Your Marketing Force You’ve already enlisted employees in the marketing effort by drilling them with key messaging. Now take it to the next level by turning customers into Street Teams: • Give customers a service or product they love. • Elicit customers’ insight—and use it—so that they’ll love what you’re offering even more. • Provide a platform for customers to share their enthusiasm. • Operate locally to build teams that influence others on a community level and collectively form a global network. broke off into a conversation about how to use our service. However, after seeing this unfold at event after event, we began to recognize what was happening: people weren’t attending these events to meet us. They were coming to meet other people using the product. (Location 952)

Many companies mistakenly think they just have to hold an event. Wrong. If you’re going to do it, do it right. • If you want a successful event, you have to act like it’s a success; your attitude becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. • The number of people is far less crucial than the mix of people: seat prospects, journalists, and customers together. • Harness your customers’ positive energy and make them part of your marketing force. People will talk about you whether you like it or not—why not provide the forum? • The event is the message. Ensure that every decision you make—from venue to food to speakers—reflects well on your business and conveys your message. • A top-tier venue can attract attendees and make your business look established. • Make sure your quality service is reflected in every aspect of the event, from the invitations you design to the confirmation e-mail you send—even to such details as having name badges ready with names spelled correctly. • Have enough people manning the doors to prevent a long wait to get in. Your guests should feel your warm welcome from the moment they arrive. • Every employee at the event must be on message and look the part. Prep team members to handle different scenarios and recognize your attendees. Remember: one individual can ruin the whole event by brushing someone off or giving an answer that is not accurate. • Networking is a vital part of every event. Help attendees meet each other, exchange contact information, join your community, and learn from one another. We host a networking reception to wrap up every event; it’s a great way to get attendees to talk to each other, meet our partners, and quiz our product experts. These networking events usually happen inside the exhibition area to leverage the energy of the live demos. • Make your event fun as well as informative. We’ve had great results inviting visionaries, such as Colin Powell, Neil Young, and Malcolm Gladwell, to speak at our events. • Your event must look effortless. Spend the necessary time to plan and make sure that all your technology and demonstrations work flawlessly—do a practice run. • Capture customer testimonials onsite at the event. We have photographers and videographers to photograph and record our most successful customers sharing their stories about how our service has changed their business. (We follow up after the event to get their approval to use these great new customer testimonials across all of our marketing properties.) • Provide every attendee with the most relevant next steps to become even more successful. For example, the next step might be a free trial of a new product, or it could be a special offer on training. Ask yourself, “What do I want the attendee to do next?” and then craft the post-event experience that will allow him or her to take action. • Put content from your event on your Web site, your company’s Facebook page, and YouTube to allow your message to continue to circulate long after the event is over.

Get Your Game Plan Ready There’s a lot of prep work necessary to execute a flawless event. • Develop your plan to acquire contacts. Define success metrics. Set your lead goal and determine your target conversion and close rates. • Establish a follow-up process before the event. Develop all communication materials, e-mails, and call scripts. Execute the plan within a few days of the event. • Create an exciting giveaway to draw traffic to your event (or booth at your trade show). Consider hot products—for example, we’ve seen success with iPhones, MacBooks, and Nintendo Wiis. • Have a compelling offer, such as an exclusive discount on your product or service, for target attendees. • Provide content that validates your ideas. White papers or best practices documentation by third parties is effective. • Leverage complementary partnerships. Invite business partners to collaborate with you in planning and hosting an event, or team up with complementary partners at trade shows to drive traffic to one another’s area. • Create a takeaway piece for attendees that includes your offer, contact information, and quotes from successful customers and other third-party validation.
