For one thing, showing the how and why of human life is a monumental job. You have to have a deep and precise understanding of the biggest, most complex subject there is. And then you have to be able to translate your understanding into a story. For most writers, that may be the biggest challenge of all. (Location 13)

But telling a story is not simply making up or remembering past events. Events are just descriptive. The storyteller is really selecting, connecting, and building a series of intense moments. These moments are so charged that the listener feels he is living them himself. Good storytelling doesn't just tell audiences what happened in a life. It gives them the experience of that life. It is the essential life, just the crucial thoughts and events, but it is conveyed with such freshness and newness that it feels part of the audience's essential life too. (Location 66)

Good storytelling lets the audience relive events in the present so they can understand the forces, choices, and emotions that led the character to do what he did. (Location 71)

Withholding, or hiding, information is crucial to the storyteller's make-believe. It forces the audience to figure out who the character is and what he is doing and so draws the audience into the story. (Location 75)

The dramatic code, embedded deep in the human psyche, is an artistic description of how a person can grow or evolve. (Location 83)

Any character who goes after a desire and is impeded is forced to struggle (otherwise the story is over). And that struggle makes him change. So the ultimate goal of the dramatic code, and of the storyteller, is to present a change in a character or to illustrate why that change did not occur. (Location 94)

The different forms of storytelling frame human change in differing ways: ■ Myth tends to show the widest character arc, from birth to death and from animal to divine. ■ Plays typically focus on the main character's moment of decision. ■ Film (especially American film) shows the small change a character might undergo by seeking a limited goal with great intensity. ■ Classic short stories usually track a few events that lead the character to gain a single important insight. ■ Serious novels typically depict how a person interacts and changes within an entire society or show the precise mental and emotional processes leading up to his change. ■ Television drama shows a number of characters in a minisociety struggling to change simultaneously.

KEY POINT: Stories don't show the audience the "real world"; they show the story world. The story world isn't a copy of life as it is. It's life as human beings imagine it could be. It is human life condensed and heightened so that the audience can gain a better understanding of how life itself works. (Location 106)

We might say that theme, or what I call moral argument, is the brain of the story. Character is the heart and circulation system. Revelations are the nervous system. Story structure is the skeleton. Scenes are the skin. (Location 113)

Nature uses a few basic patterns (and a number of variations) to connect elements in a sequence, including linear, meandering, spiral, branching, and explosive.1 Storytellers use these same patterns, individually and in combination, to connect story events over time. (Location 119)
