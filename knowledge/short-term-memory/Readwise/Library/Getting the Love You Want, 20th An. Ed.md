Our experience has taught us that the primary reason couples fail at creating an I-Thou relationship is that they did not experience it in childhood. Unfortunately, most people experience their first “relationship difficulty” in the first eighteen months of life. Experts in child development call this critical period the “Attachment Stage.” (Location 153)

Children raised by attuned parents are more likely to create satisfying love relationships in adulthood. Because they had safe, nurturing bonds with their caregivers, they do not have an exaggerated fear of abandonment or engulfment. (Location 165)

They are not likely to choose a partner out of sheer neediness because most of their primary needs were satisfied in childhood. They are not attracted to people who neglect, criticize, or abuse them. Being mistreated feels totally foreign, out of place, and intrinsically wrong. (Location 167)

After several years of using this exercise, we discovered that the listening partner can magnify the healing effect of mirroring by asking this question: “Do you have more to say about that?” Or, simply, “Is there more about that?” It’s a wonderful feeling to have your partner’s full attention and to be asked to reveal even more about what you are thinking and feeling.

A recent discovery in astronomy gives us another example of the dyadic nature of the universe, one that is especially appropriate for our view of love relationships. We now know that most stars in the sky are not solitary stars like our sun. Most of them have a “companion star.” The two stars are attracted to each other by a strong gravitational force but are kept from collapsing into each other by an opposing centrifugal force. Helen and I like to think of two people in a conscious love relationship as companion stars. Each person is a unique individual ablaze with potential. One is just as important as the other, and each has a unique and equally valid view of the universe. Yet, together, they form a greater whole, kept connected by the pull of mutual love and respect. They mirror the interconnected universe. (Location 300)

THE MYSTERY OF ATTRACTION The type of human being we prefer reveals the contours of our heart. —ORTEGA Y GASSET (Location 497)

The brain stem, which is the inner and most primitive layer, is that part of the brain that oversees reproduction, self-preservation, and vital functions such as the circulation of blood, breathing, sleeping, and the contraction of muscles in response to external stimulation. Located at the base of the skull, this portion of the brain is sometimes referred to as the “reptilian brain,” because all vertebrates from reptiles to mammals share this portion of the anatomy. For the purpose of this discussion, let’s think of the brain stem as the source of physical action. (Location 592)

Flaring like a wishbone around the top of the brain stem is the portion of the brain called the limbic system, whose function seems to be the generation of vivid emotions. Scientists can surgically stimulate the limbic system of laboratory animals and create spontaneous outbursts of fear and aggression. In this book I use the term “old brain” to refer to the portion of the brain that includes both the brain stem and the limbic system. Think of the old brain as being hard-wired and determining most of your automatic reactions. (Location 596)

The final area of the brain is the cerebral cortex, a large, convoluted mass of brain tissue that surrounds the two inner sections and is itself divided into four regions or lobes. This portion of the brain, which is most highly developed in Homo sapiens, is the site of most of our cognitive functions. I refer to the cerebral cortex as the “new brain” because it appeared most recently in evolutionary history. Your new brain is the part of you that is conscious, alert, and in contact with your daily surroundings. It’s the part of you that makes decisions, thinks, observes, plans, anticipates, responds, organizes information, and creates ideas. The new brain is inherently logical and tries to find a cause for every effect and an effect for every cause. To a degree, it can moderate some of the instinctual reactions of your old brain.

Let’s stop for a moment and sort out this proliferation of self parts. We have now succeeded in fracturing your original wholeness, the loving and unified nature that you were born with, into three separate entities: 1. Your “lost self,” those parts of your being that you had to repress because of the demands of society. 2. Your “false self,” the facade that you erected in order to fill the void created by this repression and by a lack of adequate nurturing. 3. Your “disowned self,” the negative parts of your false self that met with disapproval and were therefore denied. (Location 918)

By listening to popular songs, reading love poems, plays, and novels, and listening to hundreds of couples describe their relationships, I have come to the conclusion that all the words exchanged between lovers since time began can be reduced to four basic sentences—the rest is elaboration. And these four sentences offer a rare glimpse into the unconscious realm of romantic love. (Location 1157)

The first of these sentences occurs early in a relationship, maybe during the first or second encounter, and it goes something like this: “I know we’ve just met, but somehow I feel as though I already know you.” (Location 1160)

Finally, at some point, lovers utter a fourth and final declaration of love. They tell each other: “I love you so much, I can’t live without you.” They have become so involved with each other that they can’t imagine a separate existence. I call this the “phenomenon of necessity.” (Location 1171)

To a therapist, Kathryn’s use of global words like “always” and “never” would have been a clear indication that she was in a regressive state. Young children have a hard time distinguishing between past and present; whatever is happening at this moment has always happened in the past and will always happen in the future. (Location 1473)

Now we have defined the three major sources of conflict that make up the power struggle. As the illusion of romantic love slowly erodes, the two partners begin to: 1. Stir up each other’s repressed behaviors and feelings. 2. Reinjure each other’s childhood wounds. 3. Project their own negative traits onto each other. (Location 1549)

When partners don’t tell each other what they want and constantly criticize each other for missing the boat, it’s no wonder that the spirit of love and cooperation disappears. In its place comes the grim determination of the power struggle, in which each partner tries to force the other to meet his or her needs. (Location 1586)

First of all, we choose our partners for two basic reasons: (1) they have both the positive and the negative qualities of the people who raised us, and (2) they compensate for positive parts of our being that were cut off in childhood. We enter the relationship with the unconscious assumption that our partner will become a surrogate parent and make up for all the deprivation of our childhood. All we have to do to be healed is to form a close, lasting relationship. (Location 1614)

Once you become skilled in this nondefensive approach to criticism, you will make an important discovery: in most interactions with your partner, you are actually safer when you lower your defenses than when you keep them engaged, because your partner becomes an ally, not an enemy. (Location 1675)

Ten Characteristics of a Conscious Partnership 1. You realize that your love relationship has a hidden purpose—the healing of childhood wounds. Instead of focusing entirely on surface needs and desires, you learn to recognize the unresolved childhood issues that underlie them. When you look at relationships with this X-ray vision, your daily interactions take on more meaning. Puzzling aspects of your relationship begin to make sense to you, and you have a greater sense of control. (Location 1687)

You create a more accurate image of your partner. At the very moment of attraction, you began fusing your lover with your primary caretakers. Later you projected your negative traits onto your partner, further obscuring your partner’s essential reality. As you move toward a conscious relationship, you gradually let go of these illusions and begin to see more of your partner’s truth. You see your partner not as your savior but as another wounded human being, struggling to be healed. (Location 1691)

The final truth in the story of Moses is that we expect life’s rewards to come to us easily and without sacrifice. Just as the Israelites wanted the Promised Land to be the Garden of Eden, God’s ready-made gift to Adam and Eve, we want the simple act of falling in love to cure all our ills. We want to live in a fairy tale where the beautiful princess meets the handsome prince and they live happily ever after. But it was only when the Israelites saw the Promised Land as an opportunity, as a chance to create a new reality, that they were allowed to enter. And it is only when we see love relationships as a vehicle for change and self-growth that we can begin to satisfy our unconscious yearnings. (Location 1839)

In his famous book, I-Thou, written in the same decade as Stack’s Theory, Buber made it clear that his interest was not so much on the “I” and the “Thou” as on the hyphen between the two words, which he called the “sacred between.” According to Buber, “All life is meeting.” (Location 1895)

FUSER-ISOLATER DYNAMICS THE TWO MEMBERS of a love relationship often react to the commitment to stay together in opposite ways. Typically, one partner feels relieved; the other feels threatened. The one who feels relieved is usually the “fuser” in the relationship, the one who grew up with an unsatisfied need for attachment. The one who feels threatened is the “isolater,” the one who has an unsatisfied need for autonomy. (Location 1937)

A tacit agreement has been broken. In retaliation they erect an emotional barricade. In effect, they are saying, “I am angry at you for not meeting my needs.” Then they begin systematically to seek pleasure and satisfaction outside the relationship. Like a cow in a pen stretching its neck over a fence to graze on green grass, they look elsewhere for gratification. The husband who stays late at the office even when he has finished the day’s work, the wife who spends the entire evening reading to the children while her husband watches TV—both of these individuals are trying to find pleasure that is missing from their relationships.

The other reason couples avoid intimacy is fear, specifically the fear of emotional pain that might replicate what they experienced in childhood. On an unconscious level, many people react to their partners as if they were enemies. (Location 2004)

WHEN I LEAD couples through these series of commitments—an agreement to: (1) come to a minimum of twelve therapy sessions, (2) define their relationship vision, (3) stay together for a specified period of time, and (4) gradually commit to closing their exits—I let them know that all of these separate agreements ideally lead to a larger commitment: a decision to join together in a journey that will last the rest of their lives. Although this decision cannot be made at the beginning of therapy, I want couples to know that, in order to obtain maximum psychological and spiritual growth, they need to stay together not for three months or three years or even three decades, but for all of their remaining years. Childhood issues do not present themselves to be resolved in one tidy package. They come to the surface slowly, usually the more superficial ones first. Sometimes a problem has to present itself a number of times before it is even identified as a significant issue. And sometimes a psychological need is so deeply buried that it is only triggered by a crisis or the demands of a particular stage of life. Ultimately it takes a lifetime together for a couple to identify and heal the majority of their childhood wounds. In a culture where serial monogamy is a way of life, the idea of a permanent commitment to one partner has a quaint, old-fashioned ring to it. The prevalent question of the 1950s—“Can this relationship be saved?”—has now become “Should this relationship be saved?” And millions of people decide that the answer is no. In fact, ironically, many people now view divorce as an opportunity for personal growth. It’s not within relationship that people grow and change, according to this increasingly popular view, it’s when the relationship falls apart. (Location 2063)

THE SURPRISE LIST AFTER INTRODUCING THE Reromanticizing exercise to scores of couples, I began to notice a curious phenomenon: the positive value of doing this exercise seemed to flatten out after a few months. The couples were faithfully following the instructions, but they were no longer experiencing the deep pleasure they had when they began doing the exercise. It occurred to me that I needed to build the concept of “random reinforcement” into the exercise. (Location 2213)

A deeper source of resistance to the exercise, however, is a paradoxical one—the fear of pleasure. On a conscious level, we go to great lengths to seek happiness. Why, then, should we be afraid of it? To make sense of this reaction, we need to remember that the sensation of being fully alive is deeply pleasurable. When we were young children, our life energy was boundless and we experienced intense joy. But some of our pleasure was curtailed by our caregivers so that we could be safe and conform to social norms: “Girls don’t yell and run.” “Don’t jump on the couch.” “Be careful! Come down from that tree.” “You’re making too much noise.” But our fun was also cut short because it threatened the repressed state of our caregivers. They had long given up diving into the lake, rolling down the hill, skipping down the sidewalk, and jumping up and down for joy. (Location 2251)

Isolaters often have a difficult time with this exercise. They want to cooperate, but they just can’t think of anything their partners can do for them; they don’t seem to have any needs or desires. What they are really doing is hiding behind the psychic shield they erected as children to protect themselves from overbearing parents. They discovered early in life that one way to maintain a feeling of autonomy around their intrusive parents was to keep their thoughts and feelings to themselves. When they deprived their parents of this valuable information, their parents were less able to invade their space. After a while, many isolaters do the ultimate disappearing act and hide their feelings from themselves. In the end, it is safest not to know. (Location 2280)

It is not enough for partners to understand the unconscious motivations that they bring to their relationship; insight alone does not heal childhood wounds. Nor is it sufficient to introduce behavioral changes into a relationship without the couples understanding the reasons behind them. In either case, the couples experience only limited growth. Experience has taught me that the most effective form of therapy is one that combines both schools of thought. As you learn more about your unconscious motivations and transform these insights into supportive behaviors, you can create a more conscious and ultimately more rewarding relationship.

Instead of seeing your partner’s differing views as a source of conflict, you realize that they are a source of knowledge: “What are you seeing that I am not seeing?” “What have you learned that I have yet to learn?” Relationships give you the opportunity to be continually schooled in your own reality and in the reality of another person.

When our partners behave in ways that deviate from our idealized view of them, we have an arsenal of weapons to help us maintain our illusions. We can condemn them: “You are a bad (ungrateful, insensitive, boorish, stupid, spiteful, uninformed, crass, unenlightened, etc.) person for feeling that way.” We can “educate” them: “You don’t really feel that way. What you really feel is …” We can threaten them: “Unless you change your mind, I’m going to …” We can ignore them: “Uh-huh. Very interesting. As I was saying …” And we can analyze them: “The reason you have such unacceptable thoughts and feelings is that years ago your mother …” In all of these responses, we are trying to diminish our partners’ sense of self and replace it with our own, self-serving illusion.

If you are like most people, you do not pay full attention when your partner is talking. When you should be listening, you are instead responding to the impact of what you are hearing: “My partner just said that he wants a separate vacation. What does that mean? Does he want to spend less time around me? Is he going to meet someone else?” In a sense, you are listening to yourself react. When you focus on your inner reaction instead of on the words your partner is saying, your partner senses that disconnect. (Location 2485)

Second, when you listen carefully and then ask your partner what those words mean to him or her, you discover that you do indeed live with another person, someone whose inner experience is quite different from yours. This awareness is called “differentiation,” and it is a necessary precondition for a safe, intimate relationship. While there are many similarities in nature—leaves on the same tree, for example, are very similar to one another—no two leaves are the same. Difference is a fact of nature. When you assume that your partner is identical to you, you are negating your partner’s existence. (Location 2488)

Finally, the regular use of the Imago Dialogue creates a deep emotional connection between you and your partner. This is especially true when you are in conflict. Using this structured way of talking creates emotional safety, which is necessary for a lasting connection. When you feel safe, your defenses relax. You become aware of parts of yourself that have been hidden from view since childhood, and you sense enough trust in the relationship to express them: “I really am musical.” “I am basically a peaceful person.” (Location 2495)

THE THREE STEPS OF THE IMAGO DIALOGUE LET’S TAKE A closer look at the three steps of the Imago Dialogue. The first is called “Mirroring.” When one of you has something important to say, you begin by stating that thought or feeling in a short sentence beginning with “I.” For example, “I don’t enjoy cooking dinner for you when you don’t seem to appreciate all the effort involved.” Your partner restates the sentence in his or her own words and then asks if the message was received correctly: “Let me see if I got it. You find it hard to put the effort into cooking dinner every night when I don’t show my appreciation for all that you’ve done. Did I get you?” You repeat this process until your partner clearly understands what you mean to say. Mirroring, like many of the tools we use in Imago Relationship Therapy, had its origin in my relationship with Helen. One day, before we were married, Helen and I were engaged in an intense discussion. Although we were not angry, we were determined to get our points across. Suddenly, Helen paused the conversation and said: “Stop. We’re not listening to each other. I have an idea. Why don’t we take turns talking and listening. You can talk while I listen. Then I’ll say back to you what I heard. Then we can switch. I’ll talk and you listen.” I agreed, and we ended up having a very good conversation. In fact, we felt unusually close to each other. I was not a stranger to the value of listening. As a therapist, I made it a practice to listen carefully to all of my clients. I also encouraged couples to listen closely to one another. But I had always viewed mirroring as a way to help them understand each other’s words and solve specific problems. Until that experience with Helen, I hadn’t realized that mirroring has a deeper healing effect: it can strengthen the feelings of connection between couples, giving it a value in and of itself.

After a few years, I added another step to the mirroring portion of the exercise. Once the receiving partner had understood what the sending partner had said, I coached the receiver to add these words: “Is there more?” This gave the sender a chance to expand on the topic. “It takes me at least an hour to cook dinner, and I do my best to make it attractive and delicious. I feel sad when you eat without comment.” The sender continues adding more information until he or she has no more to say. (Location 2502)

Once people have completed the guided-imagery exercise, they have the information they need to construct their imagos, the inner images of the opposite sex that guided them in mate selection.

This appears to be the only way to erase the pains of childhood. (Location 2811)

An answer began to take shape in my mind. It was the only logical conclusion. If people were going to be healed, I conjectured, their partners would have to change. The workaholic husband would have to willingly redirect some of his energy back to his wife. The depressed, frigid wife would have to recover her energy and sensuality. The reluctant lover would have to lower his barriers to intimacy. Then and only then would they be able to give their partners the consistent nurturing they had been looking for all their lives.

I began to develop an exercise called “The Behavior Change Request Dialogue” that would help make this happen. It had some of the same features as the Reromanticizing exercise. One partner would be asked to come up with a list of requests, which the other partner would be free to honor or not. In this exercise, however, the requests would be for changes in behavior, not for simple, pleasurable interactions; in fact, virtually every one of the requests would zero in on a point of contention. For instance, people would be asking their partners to become more assertive or more accepting or less manipulative. In essence, they would be asking them to overcome their most prominent negative traits. (Location 2838)

People would have to learn how to overcome their limitations and develop their capacity to love, not because they expected love in return but simply because their partners deserved to be loved. The unconscious mind accepts only unconditional gifts. It is not interested in “deals.” (Location 2850)

There was an easier solution, I realized, and that was for them to examine their criticisms of their partners. As I explained in the previous chapter, couples can get an accurate picture of what they did not get in childhood by analyzing their chronic complaints about their partners. The details aren’t there—who did what when—but the raw material is sitting right on the surface, ready to be mined. The months or years that the couple have spent together have worn away their softer, more superficial annoyances and exposed the stony outcrop of their fundamental needs. “You never … !” “You always … !” “When are you ever going to … !” At the heart of these accusations is a disguised plea for the very things they didn’t get in childhood—affection, affirmation, protection, independence, attachment. To come up with the list of requests for this exercise, therefore, the couples would simply need to isolate the desires hidden in their chronic frustrations. (Location 2855)

then sent the workshop participants back to their rooms, having asked them to identify a chronic complaint, isolate the desire that was at the heart of the complaint, connect it with a childhood experience, and come up with a list of concrete, doable behaviors that would help satisfy the unmet desire. They should then look at each other’s lists and rank the behaviors according to how hard they would be to act upon. I told them that sharing this information did not obligate them to meet each other’s needs, but that the purpose of the exercise was to educate each other and to develop their capacity for empathy. If their partners then made the decision to stretch into new behaviors, they would now possess some specific guidelines. Any suggestion of obligation or expectation on my part would reduce the exercise to a bargain, bringing with it the likelihood that the whole experience would end in resentment and failure.

A love relationship can fulfill your hidden drive to be healed and whole and to be deeply connected with another human being. But it can’t happen the way you want it to happen—easily, automatically, without defining what it is that you want, without asking, and without reciprocating. (Location 3048)

You have to stop expecting the outside world to take care of you and begin to accept responsibility for your own healing. And the way you do this, paradoxically, is by focusing your energy on healing your partner. It is when you direct your energy away from yourself and toward your partner that deep-level psychological and spiritual healing begins to take place. (Location 3050)

Agape is a self-transcending love that redirects eros, the life force, away from yourself and toward your partner. As one transaction follows another, the pain of the past is slowly erased, and both of you will experience the reality of your essential wholeness. (Location 3056)

Couples need to feel physically safe, to be sure, but they also need to feel emotionally safe. Without safety, they cannot say what’s on their minds, express their full range of feelings, or be who they really are. They cannot lay down their armor and connect, even if they truly want to.

To refresh your memory, the exercises are: 1) closing down the exits that prevent intimacy, 2) returning to the caring behaviors of romantic love, 3) using the Imago Dialogue to deepen understanding and compassion, and 4) defusing anger and frustration by transforming criticisms into respectful requests. These exercises help couples develop trust and goodwill and experience more joy in their daily lives. (Location 3070)

To enforce our decision, we instituted a rule: whoever initiated a negative comment or behavior would have to counter it with three positive statements about the other person: “I appreciate the fact that you were an attentive listener to me last night, even though you were very tired.” “You gave me such great feedback on the letter I was writing to the board members.” “I loved it when you took the time to go for a walk with me, even though you were busy.” (Location 3276)

Our statements of appreciation increased the flow of love between us. Every time Helen told me something she genuinely admired about me, I was deeply moved—each and every time. She had the same response when I praised her. Our admiration gradually evolved into a state of “chronic adoration.” (Location 3276)

In the second part of the exercise, each person gets out a piece of paper and makes a list of all the qualities her or she would like to have praised. “Tell me that you appreciate how hard I work to support us.” “Tell me that you like how intently I listen to you.” “Tell me that you like my long, shapely legs.” Then the partners exchange lists and take turns flooding each other with their specific requests. It’s like making a list of all the things you want for Christmas, only in this case, you get to receive them all. Helen and I practice the flooding exercise regularly. Even though we designed the exercise and have watched it performed over and over again, we still feel moved by the intensity of the love and affirmation we receive from each other. It makes us feel deeply, thoroughly loved. In the workshop version, all of the couples perform the exercise simultaneously. One person in each couple sits in a chair while the other partner circles around the chair. For the first minute, I ask the speakers to describe what they like about their partners’ physical features—a graceful curve to the lips, silky skin, a handsome nose, and so on. For the next minute, I ask them to speak a little louder and talk about their partners’ admirable character traits—trustworthiness, honesty, kindness, bravery, intelligence, etc. The third time around, I ask them to speak louder still and proclaim their gratitude for favors their partners have done for them—nursing them through a cold, putting chains on the tires in the middle of a snowstorm, going willingly to a family reunion, being a source of comfort when a family member had died. At the culmination of the exercise, the admiring partners proclaim their overall feelings of love and appreciation—“I can’t believe I am married to such a marvelous person.” “I love you, I love you, I love you.” “You are the woman of my dreams!” “You are my best friend and lover!” The energy is contagious. There are shouts of laughter, bear hugs, and tears of (Location 3417)

PORTRAIT OF TWO RELATIONSHIPS What makes a happy marriage? It is a question which all men and women ask one another … .

I asked Anne if she had any advice for people who would be reading this book and perhaps confronting some of these ideas for the first time. “My advice would be to focus on yourself,” she said. “And when I say that, I mean you should realize that what you are doing for your partner is what you’re doing for yourself. It’s about your own personal growth. I finally learned that, when I was stretching to meet one of Greg’s needs, I was reclaiming a part of myself. So, any time your partner asks you to do something, say to yourself, ‘Does this make sense? Does it behoove me as an individual to do this?’ And if it makes good sense and if it behooves you to do it, then do it, regardless of how you feel about it, because in meeting the needs of your partner you will be recapturing a part of yourself.” (Location 3787)

Now, in the final stage of a conscious partnership, reality love, love takes on the quality of “spontaneous oscillation,” words that come from quantum physics and describe the way energy moves back and forth between particles. When partners learn to see each other without distortion, to value each other as highly as they value themselves, to give without expecting anything in return, to commit themselves fully to each other’s welfare, love moves freely between them without apparent effort. The word that best describes this mature kind of love is not “eros,” not “agape,” but yet another Greek word, “philia,”2 which means “love between friends.” The partner is no longer perceived as a surrogate parent, or as an enemy, but as a passionate friend.

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects. It always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. (Location 4047)
