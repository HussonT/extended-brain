Thus the Sage rules by stilling minds and opening hearts by filling bellies and strengthening bones He shows people how to be simple and live without desires To be content and not look for other ways With the people so pure Who could trick them? What clever ideas could lead them astray? When action is pure and selfless everything settles into its own perfect place (Location 106)

Wu is nothingness, emptiness, non-existence Thirty spokes of a wheel all join at a common hub yet only the hole at the center allows the wheel to spin Clay is molded to form a cup yet only the space within allows the cup to hold water Walls are joined to make a room yet only by cutting out a door and a window can one enter the room and live there Thus, when a thing has existence alone it is mere dead-weight Only when it has wu, does it have life (Location 168)

The five colors blind the eye The five tones deafen the ear The five flavors dull the palate Racing, hunting, and galloping about only disturb the mind Wasting energy to obtain rare objects only impedes one’s growth So the Sage is led by his inner truth and not his outer eye He holds to what is deep and not what lies on the surface (Location 175)

When the greatness of Tao is present action arises from one’s own heart When the greatness of Tao is absent action comes from the rules of “kindness” and “justice” If you need rules to be kind and just, if you act virtuous, this is a sure sign that virtue is absent Thus we see the great hypocrisy Only when the family loses its harmony do we hear of “dutiful sons” Only when the state is in chaos do we hear of “loyal ministers” (Location 229)

The difference between a formal “yes” and a casual “yeah”—how slight! The difference between knowing the Truth and not knowing it—how great! Must I fear what others fear? Should I fear desolation when there is abundance? Should I fear darkness when that light is shining everywhere? Nonsense! The people of this world are steeped in their merrymaking as if gorging at a great feast or watching the sights of springtime Yet here I sit, without a sign, staring blank-eyed like a child I am but a guest in this world While others rush about to get things done I accept what is offered Oh, my mind is like that of a fool aloof to the clamor of life around me Everyone seems so bright and alive with the sharp distinctions of day I appear dark and dull with the blending of differences by night I am drifting like an ocean, floating like the high winds Everyone is so rooted in this world yet I have no place to rest my head Indeed I am different…. I have no treasure but the Eternal Mother I have no food but what comes from her breast (Location 243)
