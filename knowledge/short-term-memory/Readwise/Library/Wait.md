The essence of my case is this: given the fast pace of modern life, most of us tend to react too quickly. We don’t, or can’t, take enough time to think about the increasingly complex timing challenges we face. Technology surrounds us, speeding us up. We feel its crush every day, both at work and at home.

Throughout this book we will return to two questions that are central to decisions in our personal and professional lives. First, how long should we take to react or decide in a particular situation? Then, once we have a sense of the correct time period, how should we spend our time leading up to the moment of decision? We will begin by exploring these questions at superfast speeds, when reactions take just a split second. (Location 94)

Research on the vagal nerve has revealed a high-speed world inside our bodies, one so fast that we cannot consciously access it. Yet when we are asked to make a decision, such as whether to eat a marshmallow right away, it is these rapid-fire responses that help determine what kind of a decision we will make. A speedy response in our hearts can help us delay a speedy response in our brains and bodies. It is a strange idea, but being fast at first really can help us go slow later on. (Location 336)
