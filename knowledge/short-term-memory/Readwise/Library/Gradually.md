Debt creates the ultimate incentive to demand dollars. So long as dollars are scarce relative to the amount of outstanding debt, the dollar remains relatively stable and in very high demand.

Complex systems that have artificially suppressed volatility tend to become extremely fragile, while at the same time exhibiting no visible risks.

But those who clamor for “conscious direction”—and who cannot believe that anything which has evolved without design (and even without our understanding it) should solve problems which we should not be able to solve consciously—should remember this: The problem is precisely how to extend the span of our utilization of resources beyond the span of the control of any one mind; and therefore, how to dispense with the need of conscious control, and how to provide inducements which will make the individuals do the desirable things without anyone having to tell them what to do. —Friedrich A.

Forcing risk-taking on practically all individuals within an economic system is not natural, nor is it fundamental to the functioning of an economy. It is precisely the opposite, and it is detrimental to the stability of the system as a whole. As an economic function, risk-taking itself is productive, necessary, and inevitable. Te unhealthy part is specifcally when individuals are forced (consciously or not) into taking risk as a byproduct of central banks manufacturing money to lose value

While individuals can have a lower time preference (weighting the future over the present) or a higher time preference (weighting the present over the future), everyone has a positive time preference.

who plan and save for the future (i.e., possessing a low time preference) are predisposed to value the present over the future on the margin. Taken to an extreme for illustrative purposes, if you earned money and literally never spent a dime (or a sat), the money would not have done you any good. Even if the value of money is increasing over time, consumption or investment in the present has an inherent bias over the future, on average, because of positive time preference and daily consumption needs that must be satisfed for survival (if not for want).
