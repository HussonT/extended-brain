It isn't easy for me to be confident that my opinions are right. In the markets, you can do a huge amount of work and still be wrong. (Location 142)

2) Bad opinions can be very costly. Most people come up with opinions and there’s no cost to them. Not so in the market. This is why I have learned to be cautious. No matter how hard I work, I really can’t be sure. (Location 143)

3) The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make any money, you have to be right when they’re wrong. (Location 145)

I came up with the best independent opinions I could muster to get what I wanted. For example, when I wanted to make money in the markets, I knew that I had to learn about companies to assess the attractiveness of their stocks. At the time, Fortune magazine had a little tear-out coupon that you could mail in to get the annual reports of any companies on the Fortune 500, for free. (Location 150)

I learned that there is nothing to fear from truth. While some truths can be scary—for example, finding out that you have a deadly disease—knowing them allows us to deal with them better. Being truthful, and letting others be completely truthful, allows me and others to fully explore our thoughts and exposes us to the feedback that is essential for our learning. (Location 205)

People who worry about looking good typically hide what they don’t know and hide their weaknesses, so they never learn how to properly deal with them and these weaknesses remain impediments in the future. (Location 460)

This explains why people who are interested in making the best possible decisions rarely are confident that they have the best possible answers. So they seek to learn more (often by exploring the thinking of other believable people, especially those who disagree with them) and they are eager to identify their weaknesses so that they don’t let these weaknesses stand in the way of them achieving their goals.

So they seek to learn more (often by exploring the thinking of other believable people, especially those who disagree with them) and they are eager to identify their weaknesses so that they don’t let these weaknesses stand in the way of them achieving their goals. So, what are your biggest weaknesses? Think honestly about them because if you can identify them, you are on the first step toward accelerating your movement forward. So think about them, write them down, and look at them frequently. (Location 470)

In summary, I believe that you can probably get what you want out of life if you can suspend your ego and take a no-excuses approach to achieving your goals with open-mindedness, determination, and courage, especially if you rely on the help of people who are strong in areas that you are weak.

In other words, “The Process” consists of five distinct steps: Have clear goals. Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving your goals. Accurately diagnose these problems. Design plans that explicitly lay out tasks that will get you around your problems and on to your goals. Implement these plans—i.e., do these tasks. (Location 570)

By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it doesn’t give a damn what you “like.” So it is up to you to take full responsibility to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it, and then to do those things—which often are difficult but produce good results—so that you’ll then deserve to get what you want.

It is important not to confuse “goals” and “desires.” Goals are the things that you really want to achieve, while desires are things you want that can prevent you from reaching your goals—as I previously explained, desires are typically first-order consequences. (Location 633)

The more painful the problem, the louder it is screaming.[44] In order to be successful, you have to 1) perceive problems and 2) not tolerate them.

You will be much more effective if you focus on diagnosis and design rather than jumping to solutions. It is a very common mistake for people to move directly from identifying a tough problem to a proposed solution in a nanosecond without spending the hours required to properly diagnose and design a solution. This typically yields bad decisions that don’t alleviate the problem. Diagnosing and designing are what spark strategic thinking. You must be calm and logical. When diagnosing problems, as when identifying problems, reacting emotionally, though sometimes difficult to avoid, can undermine your effectiveness as a decision-maker. By contrast, staying rational will serve you well. So if you are finding yourself shaken by your problems, do what you can to get yourself centered before moving forward. You must get at the root causes. (Location 746)

TO GET THE PEOPLE RIGHT... 37) Recognize the Most Important Decisions You Make Are Who You Choose to Be Your Responsible Party 38)      Remember that almost everything good comes from having great people operating in a great culture. 39)      First, match the person to the design. a) Most importantly, find people who share your values. b) Look for people who are willing to look at themselves objectively and have character. c) Conceptual thinking and common sense are required in order to assign someone the responsibility for achieving goals (as distinct from tasks). 40)      Recognize that the inevitable responsible party is the person who bears the consequences of what is done. 41)       By and large, you will get what you deserve over time. 42)       The most important responsible parties are those who are most responsible for the goals, outcomes, and machines (they are those higher in the pyramid). 43)       Choose those who understand the difference between goals and tasks to run things. 44) Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently 45)      Think about their very different values, abilities, and skills 46)      Understand what each person who works for you is like so that you know what to expect from them. 47)      Recognize that the type of person you fit in the job must match the requirements for that job. 48)      Use personality assessment tests and quality reflections on experiences to help you identify these differences. 49)      Understand that different ways of seeing and thinking make people suitable for different jobs. a)  People are best at the jobs that require what they do well. b) If you’re not naturally good at one type of thinking, it doesn’t mean you’re precluded from paths that require that type of thinking  50)      Don’t hide these differences. Explore them openly with the goal of figuring out how you and your people are built so you can put the right people in the right jobs and clearly assign responsibilities. 51)       Remember that people who see things and think one way often have difficulty communicating and relating to people who see things and think another way. 52) (Location 1111)

Hire Right, Because the Penalties of Hiring Wrong Are Huge 53)      Think through what values, abilities, and skills you are looking for. 54)       Weigh values and abilities more heavily than skills in deciding whom to hire. 55)      Write the profile of the person you are looking for into the job description. 56)      Select the appropriate people and tests for assessing each of these qualities and compare the results of those assessments to what you’ve decided is needed for the job. a) Remember that people tend to pick people like themselves, so pick interviewers who can identify what you are looking for. b) Understand how to use and interpret personality assessments. c) Pay attention to people’s track records. d) Dig deeply to discover why people did what they did. e) Recognize that performance in school, while of some value in making assessments, doesn’t tell you much about whether the person has the values and abilities you are looking for. f)  Ask for past reviews. g)  Check references. 57)      Look for people who have lots of great questions. 58)      Make sure candidates interview you and Bridgewater.  59)      Don’t hire people just to fit the first job they will do at Bridgewater; hire people you want to share your life with.  60)      Look for people who sparkle, not just “another one of those.”  61)      Hear the click: Find the right fit between the role and the person.  62)      Pay for the person, not for the job.  63)       Recognize that no matter how good you are at hiring, there is a high probability that the person you hire will not be the great person you need for the job. 64) Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal 65)      Understand the differences between managing, micromanaging, and not managing. a)  Managing the people who report to you should feel like “skiing together.” b) An excellent skier is probably going to be more critical and a better critic of another skier than a novice skier.  66)      Constantly compare your outcomes to your goals.  67)      Look down on your machine and yourself within it from the higher level.  68)      Connect the case at hand to your principles for handling cases of that type.  69)      Conduct the discussion at two levels when a problem occurs: 1) the “machine” level discussion of why the machine produced that outcome and 2) the “case at hand” discussion of what to do now about the problem.  70)      Don’t try to be followed; try to be understood and to understand others.

166)      Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals 167)   Remember: You are designing a “machine” or system that will produce outcomes. a) A short-term goal probably won’t require you to build a machine b) Beware of paying too much attention to what is coming at you and not enough attention to what your responsibilities are or how your machine should work to achieve your goals. 168)    Don’t act before thinking. Take the time to come up with a game plan 169)   The organizational design you draw up should minimize problems and maximize capitalization on opportunities. 170)   Put yourself in the “position of pain” for a while so that you gain a richer understanding of what you’re designing for 171)   Recognize that design is an iterative process; between a bad “now” and a good “then” is a “working through it” period. 172)   Visualize alternative machines and their outcomes, and then choose 173)   Think about second- and third-order consequences as well as first-order consequences. 174)   Most importantly, build the organization around goals rather than tasks. a) First come up with the best workflow design, sketch it out in an organizational chart, visualize how the parts interact, specify what qualities are required for each job, and, only after that is done, choose the right people to fill the jobs b) Organize departments and sub-departments around the most logical groupings. c) Make departments as self-sufficient as possible so that they have control over the resources they need to achieve the goals. d) The efficiency of an organization decreases and the bureaucracy of an organization increases in direct relation to the increase in the number of people and/or the complexity of the organization. 175)   Build your organization from the top down. a) Everyone must be overseen by a believable person who has high standards. b) The people at the top of each pyramid should have the skills and focus to manage their direct reports and a deep understanding of their jobs. c) The ratio of senior managers to junior managers and to the number of people who work two levels below should be limited, to preserve quality communication and mutual understanding. d) The number of layers from top to bottom and the ratio of managers to their direct reports will limit the size of an effective organization. e) The larger the organization, the more important are 1) information technology expertise in management and 2) cross-department communication (more on these later). f)  Do not build the organization to fit the people. 176)   Have the clearest possible delineation of responsibilities and reporting lines. a) Create an organizational chart to look like a pyramid, with straight lines down that don’t cross. 177)   Constantly think about how to produce leverage. a) You should be able to delegate the details away. b) It is far better to find a few smart people and give them the best technology than to have a greater number of ordinary and less (Location 1370)

The left hemisphere reasons sequentially, analyzes details, and excels at linear analysis. Left-brained thinkers do these things well. They are also called linear thinkers. When they excel at this type of thinking they are called “bright.”[59] o The right hemisphere reasons holistically, recognizes themes, and synthesizes the big picture. Right-brained thinkers do these things well. People who think this way are also called lateral thinkers. Those who excel at this kind of thinking are called “smart.”[60] Long before I knew that there was a Professor Sperry I saw these differences. I bet you’ve seen them too. On a scale of -5 to +5 – left-brained to right-brained – where do you think you fall? How confident are you that your self-assessment is right? • Some people see details (trees), and others see big pictures (forests). Those who “see trees” see the parts most vividly and don’t readily relate the parts to each other in order to see the big picture—e.g., they might prefer more literal, precise paintings. They are typically left-brained. Others connect the dots to pictures. In fact, they typically don’t even see the dots; they just see the pictures. They are typically right-brained. You can detect which type people are by observing what they focus on. Detailed thinkers can lose sight of the big picture and are more likely to focus in on a part than to go to the higher level and see the relationship between parts.
