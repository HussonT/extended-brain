By contrast, something truly earned makes three simple requirements of us: We make our best choice supported by the facts and the clarity of our goals. In other words, we know what we want and how far we need to go. We accept the risk involved. We put out maximum effort. (Location 411)

Live your own life, not someone else’s version of it. Commit yourself to “earning” every day. Make it a habit. Attach your earning moments to something greater than mere personal ambition. (Location 451)

Motivation I defined as the force that drives us to get up each morning and pursue a specific objective and also maintain that drive in the face of setbacks and reversals. Ability was having the aptitude and skills required to achieve a goal. Understanding was knowing what to do and how to do it—and also what not to do. Confidence was the belief that you can actually accomplish what you set out to do, whether you’ve done it before or are attempting it for the first time. Those (Location 955)

Motivation is a strategy, not a tactic. Motive is the reason we act in a certain way. Motivation is the reason we continue acting that way. It’s the difference between impulsively going running on a sunny afternoon to release some restless energy and running six days a week month after month because you want to get fit, or lose weight, (Location 1008)

You can have more than one motivation. Joyce Carol Oates, America’s prodigious woman of letters, in her essay “This I Believe,” identified not one but five reasons she writes: (1) commemoration (“memorializing a region of the world in which I have lived”); (2) bearing witness, because most people cannot do so for themselves; (3) self-expression as a “stay” against the compromises of adulthood; (4) propaganda (or “moralizing”) to “evoke sympathy” for her characters; and (5) a love for the aesthetic object that is a physical book.

That’s delusional thinking. We all need help. Accepting that fact is an act of wisdom, not a sign of weakness. Acting on it is an essential skill. This is particularly true if you work as a sole practitioner or freelancer. In organizations—corporate, governmental, or nonprofit—your support groups are built into the infrastructure.

Here’s a not-so-dirty secret of super-successful people: The smartest, most accomplished people I know are the most avid builders of their own support group and the most reliant on their group for help (and they’re not shy about admitting it).
