The Seven Ingredients of Hypergrowth You're not ready to grow … until you Nail a Niche. Overnight success is a fairy tale. You're not going to be magically discovered, so you need sustainable systems that Create Predictable Pipeline. Speeding up growth creates more problems than it solves. Growth exposes your weaknesses. Things will actually get worse until you Make Sales Scalable. It's hard to build a big business out of small deals … so figure out how to Double Your Deal Size. It'll take years longer than you want … don't quit too soon or let a Year of Hell discourage you. Be prepared to Do the Time. Your employees are renting, not owning, their jobs. Embrace Employee Ownership to develop a culture of taking initiative beyond a job description. If you're an employee, you're letting frustrations stop, rather than motivate, you. Stop waiting for someone else to fix it; flip your frustrations to your advantage and Define Your Destiny. Follow the Impossible recipe to kick off your biggest growth spurt yet and make success Inevitable.

**Location 350:**
Because when it feels like you're swimming upstream every day to generate leads, or to sign new customers from the ones you do get, you usually have a bigger problem. All that time, energy, and money invested in growing new leads and closing sales can be poured into a black hole—if you haven't Nailed a Niche.

**Location 359:**
Clues You Aren't Ready to Grow (Regardless of What the CEO or Board Expects) You've grown mostly through referrals, word of mouth, and up-/cross-selling. Inbound or outbound lead generation has been disappointing … or abysmal. You realize, looking back, that you're dependent on preexisting relationships or a recognized brand to get in the door, even if your product or service is amazing. You're good at too many things, and struggle focusing on the one best opportunity to sell and deliver over and over again. Even when you get quality appointments, too few people buy. If you can't predictably generate leads and opportunities where you're needed, win them, and do it profitably, you're gonna struggle.

Everyone Hates to Admit They're Not Ready to Grow Swallowing the “we're not ready to grow yet” pill is bitter. Especially when you have a board or CEO breathing down your neck, a payroll to meet, or big family bills.

No one likes admitting they're a nice-to-have rather than a need-to-have. Or that the elevator pitch the CEO came up with is totally off-base and confuses prospects. Or that you can't yet measure or document other customers’ results.

One of the indicators that you've Nailed a Niche is that you're consistently able to find and sign up unaffiliated customers.

Since you have 10, you can definitely get 20… and then 100. If you can get 10 unaffiliated customers to pay you (no small feat), I guarantee you can get 20. And if you keep going at it, you will get at least to 100. And then 200, at least. At a minimum, you can keep doubling and doubling. I'm not saying it's easy, but it's possible.

More importantly, it's amazing you got those 10. Ten is not a small number! Because why the heck should they trust you, and pay for your product? It stands on its own without you needing a prior relationship. It's a huge vote of confidence. Maybe you were on TechCrunch, Reddit, Bob's Insurance Newsletter, or some blog—great. But in the real world, with Mainstream Buyers, no one has ever heard of you. You're not “the thing” all their friends are buying, making them feel that without it they're being left behind.

Assume You Are Marketing to Fourth Graders With those tiny slices of attention that “cold” people are willing to give you, it's similar to the mental investment of a third- or fourth grader. So your message has to be simple for them to both understand and easily act on, or else they'll move on before ever giving it a chance.

**Location 514:**
There are different reasons something appeals to us at the dinosaur brain level, before our conscious minds have time to process it, such as: Newness Contrast (“There's a bucket of blue pens with one orange pen on the top”) Movement/speed Surprises Details Visuals This is why you'll see banner ads with a color that's different from the page background and with moving pictures, to combine the attention-getting elements of visuals, contrast, and movement. Or why video-sharing sites have so many videos titled like He Hated His Boss for Two Years until This Happened with a picture, combining visuals and anticipated surprise and detail. And it works, at least until you learn from watching several that the videos are rarely as interesting as the titles, and you start ignoring them.

It takes a lot of energy to buy and use something new, so if you're a nice-to-have, it won't stick. Nice-to-haves fall to the bottom of the “must do” list. If the buyer doesn't need your solution, they won't be motivated to go through all the work to convince their people, justify the purchase, roll it out, and get people to use it.

What problem is painful enough that a team of people will spend both their money and time to fix it? If you are solving a need, how can you describe what you do differently, so prospects also see it that way? What differentiates the customers who need you from the ones who don't? Where can you create the most financial value? Where can you get permission to create case studies or get references? (With some types of markets or customers these are almost impossible to get.) How can you “sell money”? How can you sell “things”?

Let go of knowing what the answer is ahead of time—just get to the next step. And reevaluate. And repeat. Guaranteed, though—if you're spreading yourself across multiple things, you're just diluting yourself.

It's easier to make the pond smaller than make the fish bigger: It's easier to retarget, refocus, and reframe yourself than to change your products and offerings. To grow past word-of-mouth marketing, you have to stand out. It's easier to stand out and win deals in a smaller pond. When you share too many things that you excel at (too many ponds), it's more likely to confuse prospects than impress them.

Interesting/weird/compelling/exciting outlier customers that you'd want more of. Other new exciting opportunities. What market or type of project has been the most successful? What are you the best at? What's been the easiest way you have been able to make the most money so far? If people hired you for just one thing, what is it or would it be? Review other customer patterns: What should you win at but haven't because you haven't invested in it? Categorize your biggest projects, types of project, problems solved, benefits/results. What's your best proof case from the past? Which projects created the biggest financial benefits for customers? Where is there detailed proof that you're allowed to publish? Best competitive position? Where are your best chances for winning? Where is the best future opportunity: What's in demand? Is there a rising tide? Where/with what kind of project can you get measurable results? Where do you have passion? (Or will success be your passion?)

So what? “Manual payroll creates errors every month, meaning employees get frustrated, reducing selling time (pain #1), and finance teams spend 10 hours a month fixing silly errors (pain #2).” Usually the “Solutions” box fills up fast. That's the easy one. Do your people keep wanting to fill the “Specific Pains” box with solutions? Is your “Results” box frustratingly blank? Spend the time to nail these down—pains/solutions/results—even if it takes 10 times longer than you think it should.

Step 4: Validate If you're ready to jump in: By this point, you may be ready to jump into going after that first choice, such as with a lead generation campaign. Even so, get started by finding a couple of prospects in that niche(s) to interview, to fill out and update your niche with details—especially the Pains and Results. Find people who either don't know you too well, or a customer who's not afraid to give you brutally honest answers. And then move on to Step 5. If you're not ready to go after it: Sometimes you realize that although your top niche seems like a great possibility, something important is missing. It may require a different product, research into regulations, licensing, research, or another kind of validation. Before going on here, skip ahead to “The 20-Interview Rule” on page 38. Step 5: Campaign to Learn Now and Grow Later If you feel like you are ready to start targeting that niche, you should be clear enough by this point to start a lead generation program around it. Spending effort on a lead generation campaign of some kind (any kind) forces you to jump in and keep iterating who you're going after, why they should care, and what they're interested in. It's not the leads here that are important—yet. It's the learning. The faster you learn how to generate leads, the faster you can get ready to grow. Give yourself 90 days as the learning or beta-test period before counting your growth chickens. Essentially, what you're doing here is four things: Define a target list, usually of prospects, partners, or marketing outlets. Decide on how you want to reach out, that is, cold emailing, calling, referrals, social, mail, blogging, and so on—and what you'll say and ask for. Remember to write from the reader's point of view: What's in it for them? What's the minimum required preparation needed before you can start campaigning? Don't overplan here on creating the ultimate marketing or outbound plan, building a ton of content and then … nothing works. For example, if you're prospecting, ideally you have a case study or short introductory video you can use. But if you don't—don't let that stop you from getting started. It's more efficient to learn and create any other tools or content along the way. Finally: Stop procrastinating and just send the first campaign. Even if it's just one phone call, letter, tweet, or email.

Interviewing Tips Online surveys can be easy, but live interviews allow you to go deeper into details. To do surveys well you need to know what questions to ask. Interviews help you understand which questions to ask. You don't need a lot of interviews: One is better than zero, and rarely do you need more than three to five unless you're creating an entirely brand new product and pitch. Don't be discouraged by unproductive early interviews. It's a skill. You'll get better with practice. People open up to people. You'd like customers to share authentic stories with you, so be honest with them. Your interview shouldn't feel like an interview. It should feel like a conversation. Listen carefully and you can discover surprising ways customers use your product or service, (un)conscious reasons they resist buying, and internal keywords and key phrases useful for sales and marketing copy. You'll get better at interviewing with practice.

The 20-Interview Rule is simple: Before you write a line of code, finalize your niche, or take some other kind of leap, interview 20 real potential customers. Not your friends. Not people you know. They have to be real potential buyers; that is, if you hope to sell to sales managers, you can't interview a rep. You have to interview a VP or a Director of Sales or Sales Operations. And you have to do 20 of them. We know it's hard to get to 20, but it's the right number:

You need to understand your prospective app from the purchaser's perspective, for real. You need the next five interviews to confirm your pattern recognition. You learn from the first five; you confirm in the next five. You need interviews 11–20 to nail your pitch and hone your thesis. Once you truly understand the white space from a buyer's perspective, and you've figured out the nuances and challenges, it's time to nail your pitch. And by doing this, you'll also hone your thesis and strategy. That's what interviews 11–20 are for: To filter out all the “nice-to-haves’“from the “must-haves” in your pitch. To dig in on what is really 10 times better, not just two times or five times better.

Here's one sample format that's worked for us: Start by saying, “You know how some people have [problem]? Well, we [solution and/or benefit]. For example, [one sentence case study].” You know how some retail chains struggle getting mobile users to redeem coupons? We have a way to increase redemption rates by 50%. For example, Bob's Tacos saw redemptions double in 30 days. You know how some retail chains turn over employees as fast as they can hire them? We can tell you the top five fixable reasons your employee attrition is too high. For example, Walsmartz halved their retail store staff attrition, so they're turning over the whole staff only every two years, instead of every year. Notice it's not about the steps you take to help them—it's about the results they want and desire. If it's interesting, they will naturally ask you more questions about how you do it.

A revenue rollercoaster of up-and-down growth results (either as a company, team, or individual). You're beating your lead volume goals, but are missing your revenue goals. More than 30% of your salespeople are missing quota. Unexpectedly low close rates. Unmotivated salespeople.

What's Important: There Are Three Types of Leads “Seeds” are many-to-many leads, created from word-of-mouth, networks, and relationships. Usually grown through creating happy customers who refer others, and who remain as customers for years. Salesforce.com, Google, Facebook, and Slack all ignited initial hypergrowth through Seeds. “Nets” are one-to-many marketing campaigns, including the now-popular approaches of content and inbound marketing as well as outbound marketing. “Spears” are targeted outbound prospecting or business development campaigns. Usually a human is involved, working through a targeted list, calling, emailing, or using any other technique that helps them make contact and get appointments.

HOW TO GROW SEEDS PREDICTABLY The best way to methodically grow your seeds is with a repeatable program or with systems that ensure your customers are successful. This field is now commonly called Customer Success Management or just Customer Success. It means systematically reducing customer churn, increasing upsells, increasing referrals, and helping capture more and better case studies and testimonials. But this is really important: Customer Success is not about increasing customer satisfaction, but creating revenue growth.

And, like sales, it should be a revenue driver, not a cost center. As with sales, you should make money, or avoid losing it, by investing in this role.

Expansion ($20–$100 million): Why should customers expand to more seats, more features? Optimization ($100 million-plus): Automation and improvements driven by data.

Common Campaign “Build it and they'll come” marketing plan: Deciding what content a company want to share (“how great our new release is!”), then How they plan to distribute it (“let's do a webinar!”), and finally Who should we sent it to (“who do we want to invite?”).

First decide who (which companies or people) we want to speak with, then Map out what they want to hear and learn about, based on our account research, and Figure out how to get that value front of them: online marketing, webinars, cold prospecting, events, direct mail …? As Jon describes it, there are four ABM “Styles” (see Figure 6.4):

Style 1 (Strategic): Your biggest opportunities, say more than $1,000,000, targeted with completely custom (aka expensive) content and campaigns. Mistake: having too many in this category (like 100), rather than “a handful.” Example: bespoke books that are custom-made specifically for that person or company. Average investment per account: $60,000 (excludes sales or SDR salaries).* Typically 84% new accounts, 16% current customers.

**Location 1685:**
Style 2 (Scale): Potential deals of $100,000–$1,000,000. Commonly a company has 50 target accounts, further segmented into clusters of 5–15 grouped by similar issues. Highly focused programs, moderate personalization. Example: a research paper focused on specific industry trends, with a personalized introduction for that specific company. Average investment per cluster (of 5–15) accounts: $50,000.* Typically 49% new accounts, 51% current customers.* Style 3 (Programmatic): Opportunities ranging $50,000–$100,000, usually at “hundreds” to 1,000 accounts. Broad outreach such as email and direct mail. Light personalization. Example: a standard printed book, but with their logo on the cover and a handwritten note taped inside. Typically 72% new accounts, 28% current customers.* Style 4 (Targeted Demand Gen): Reserved for deals that are less than $50,000, following traditional sales and marketing approaches.

Pro Tips First, pick a date for the live event. Announce the date to people you know (before you have all the details, or even a title or location). It's okay to change it before it happens. No matter what, don't chicken out! Go through with it, even if no one shows (which can happen). What you learn from this is more important than the results (how many people attended or took your Call to Action). Do it again, and again, and again, and again …

Step 4: To Infinity, and Repeat Stop, reflect, and do it again, sticking to your “main thing” and getting better and better and better at it. For example, after you've held an event—what do you do next? Pick a date for another one. This is going to take months, at least, and maybe years, so stick to it.
