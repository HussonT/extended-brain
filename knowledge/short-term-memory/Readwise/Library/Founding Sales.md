Lastly, by no means was this a solitary enterprise. On our sales team we celebrate what we liked to say was an “engineering mindset”, and that we were “the product managers of our sales apparatus.” ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=176))

In the first epoch, it’s a tight, iterative process where you’re evangelically “selling” (there may not even be money involved) your solution (or, perhaps even “would-be solution”, before you’ve even started building it) to would-be customers, and sorting out if indeed they have the pain that you’re looking to address, how big that pain is, and what they’d be willing to pay to resolve it. This stage involves its own set of approaches, which, largely won’t be very scalable, but will support those early learnings.

The second epoch comes only after you’ve passed the first (importantly, for reasons we’ll discuss more in depth later). This is when you know your solution is viable, solves customer pain, for which they are willing to pay money, and now it’s simply a question of scaling the number of humans who are doing the selling, and, by extension scaling all inputs and outputs associated with that activity. This book will be split accordingly, with the first part coming first. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=207))

Yes, taking what has worked before, and adopting is wholesale will shorten your learning curve, but if you don’t understand the underpinnings, there’s always the risk of engaging in Cargo Cult sales activities, where you don’t quite know why you’re doing the thing you’re doing, but it worked over there, so it must work over here, right?

Lastly, by no means is what follows the end all, be all of early stage direct sales. So if you can adopt an engineering mindset as regards your sales approach, and consider yourself the product manager of your go to market, stealing best practices where they make sense, rejecting that which is no longer applicable or doesn’t fit, and building anew where needed.

At this stage, your “sales” is in large part evangelical product management and product marketing, and this is why you, as a founder, need to be involved in it. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=233))

Second, in addition to doing the actual work, yourself, a lot of that work will be activity that “doesn’t scale.” Like doing on-site sales visits for a product that will end up selling for less than $1,000 a year.

You need someone who can take a partially baked product, formulate a coherent narrative around it, present it, and then listen. And then iterate.

One of the biggest things to adjust to when approaching sales for the first time is the often counterintuitive shift required to your mindset. This is especially true for founders with a background in non-sales disciplines like engineering, product management, finance, or even marketing. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=288))

EMBRACE PLENTY, NOT SCARCITY Generally speaking, we’re taught that we should conserve resources. We’re told not to waste things. We’re all probably guilty of this—saving those extra MP3s in our iPhone’s music app, or leaving that email in our inbox, telling ourselves that we’re eventually going to get around to it. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=299))

Tags: #insight/key-point #insight/principle
Stop that, now. Reject a mindset of scarcity—and, hence, hoarding—and embrace a mindset of plenty. The thinking should be “Even if this one does not work out, there’s a line of thousands standing behind it that I need to get to.” So if a deal is stalling, if the customer doesn’t have the budget, if it turns out an account is not a perfect fit, and so on, great, fine, close it out. On to the next. You’ll get them the next time around. The thing that is scarce in sales is time. To quote one of TalentBin’s key early sales staff, Brad Snider, spending “good time with good opportunities” is paramount.

Spend good time with good opportunities. Let go of the marginal opps, knowing that you can get them later if they become more viable. There’s plenty of opportunity here. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=316))

PUT ACTIVITY ABOVE ALL ELSE Everyone’s a fan of working “smarter, not harder” in the modern knowledge-worker economy. Well, sometimes you just have to grind. Sales, like recruiting, is all about activity and leverage. Generally speaking, activity in equals value out. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=318))

More time on the phone. More demos. More proposals sent. More emails sent. More dials. More keystrokes. All of the above is activity, and activity is the goal. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=323))

No more. Just as you need to shift your mindset from scarcity to plenty, the reality is that in order to move opportunities down the pipeline and close deals, activity is job one. Jump first, prepare midair. Template all communication. Drive activity, and output will follow. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=327))

Don’t read the entire email communication history with that prospect before you call him. Just call. It’s probably going to go to voice mail anyway, and you just saved yourself five minutes of unnecessary preparation. One proofread is all that email needs. Send it, and then move on to the other fifty you have to send to your pipeline today. Don’t overthink. Just act.

BUILD MANY SHALLOW RELATIONSHIPS For the first-time sales pro, the scale of person-to-person interaction is a massive adjustment. Think about how many distinct people you typically interact with in a given week. If you’re like most professionals, it’s likely a constellation of one or two dozen people with whom you have frequent, ongoing interactions that build over time, and with whom you have substantial history. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=348))

(Why do you think the weather and sports teams are the sales pro’s best friends? Instant conversation topics.) It puts the onus on the sales pro to keep readily accessible details of these individuals, their organizations, and their pains, as well as general rapport notes—which, of course, is not possible for a normal human brain. It can be exhausting, and it can be taxing. That’s why record keeping and CRM excellence (more on this later) are paramount.

ASSUME THE SALE IS INEVITABLE & IT JUST MIGHT BE Approach your sales conversations with the stance that the prospect will inevitably be a customer. This is more applicable when you are at the scaling stage, when it is now clear that the solution that you are presenting has product/market fit. But it can be helpful even at the earlier stages of your go-to-market period. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=361))

“This is going to happen. It makes sense for you. This solution is the future, and it will make you more successful now and going forward. So we can do it now or we can do it later, but it’s going to happen, either with me or with a competitor of mine.” ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=366))

Here are a few helpful things come out of this mindset. First, it frames the conversation as “when” instead of “if.” This naturally makes the conversation more consultative and focused around business needs—that is, “This solution exists to solve this problem, and we have validated that you have this problem, so clearly this solution makes sense. Let’s figure out when and how it should be implemented.” Second, it provides a confidence boost to the sales professional, related to the “expertness and fearlessness” we’ll talk about next. Third, it sets the groundwork for an ongoing relationship with the prospect; even if they don’t close this time through the funnel (and odds are, they won’t), they will be prepped for the next pass. It will also reinforce your own record-keeping processes, since you’ll know that recording these interactions will enable your future self the next time this prospect passes through the funnel. It may feel odd to take on such a presumptuous mindset, and by no means is this a suggestion to be arrogant or off-putting in your dealings. But approaching each interaction with certainty will drive success in your conversations. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=368))

EXPECT TO WIN, BUT BE UNFAZED BY REJECTION In most of your professional interactions, you probably achieve some semblance of your goal most of the time, largely because you wouldn’t be engaged in the activity in question if you didn’t think you had a reasonable expectation of success.

Depending on your industry, and the point at which sales gets a prospect in the funnel, if yours is a new, innovative solution, a 20%–30% win rate is solid. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=382))

RECORD EVERYTHING—BUT EFFICIENTLY As an outcome of sales strategies we’ve already covered—the sheer magnitude of professional interactions you’ll have and the importance of high activity—the reality is that you are going to “closed lost” most of your opportunities. For that reason, a mindset of constant record keeping is paramount for success. Previously, you could perhaps rely on your own memory to recall what it is that you were working on, or what your last conversation with a given person had covered. No longer.

in my sales teams, every person has a lab notebook to allow them to take notes during a call (especially during the discovery section), including size of opportunity, qualification details, and so on, to later be transferred to the CRM (not wholesale, but the salient points).

BE EXPERT & AUTHORITATIVE. IT BEGETS FEARLESSNESS. Modern sales is not about trying to sell snake oil to a “mark.” Rather, sales professionals are the grease of the market. They seek out inefficiencies in the world, in the form of qualified prospects who have the business pain that the proposed solution resolves. Then they engage and consult with the prospect, and propose the implementation of the solution, to help fix that business pain.

MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME IN A GLASS HOUSE The level of transparency in a well-instrumented sales organization is a massive change for most people. From win and loss notes and closing ratios to leaderboards and error checking, everything is right there, available for everyone to see.

You should get comfortable with teammates jumping into those records and asking questions about why a call went this way or that way. Your creation of this transparent data is of paramount importance for the success of the organization, from both a go-to-market and a product-development standpoint.

Similarly, activity levels, or lack thereof, should be clearly documented and inescapable. If a rep spaced out today for some reason, the lack of calls and emails will be fully observable. And if your CRM is really well done, it will be observable down to the granularity of which hours of the day that rep was lagging.

The only question that will remain is why you haven’t hopped on top of that! In fact, your CRM reporting should yield valuable insights all the way down to every single closed-won and closed-lost opportunity. For every win, you can see the strategy that sold five seats instead of two. For every lost opportunity, you’ll see what went wrong—budget, competition, a prospect not yet convinced of your solution’s value, and so on. But you lose this insight without transparency.

And while this may sound frightening, it’s actually extremely beneficial, both for the individual and, in aggregate, for the organization. It creates an environment of accountability and shared learning that drives a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop. Your staff focuses because there’s no way not to. There’s no excuse to not work on high-priority items, because the errors are documented and visible. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=438))

Flubs and failures are socialized so other staff won’t crash on the same rocks, but also so they’ll realize that failure is part of the game, and not to be feared.

REMEMBER, SALES IS ABOUT MATH When people think about what is needed for sales success, they jump to a lot of “right brain” activities. Storytelling, persuasion, rapport building, and such. Socialization, drinking, and dinner. Shooting from the hip and making it up as you go. They don’t consider, or at least not as much, that sales is something that involves lots of metrics, math, and reporting. Guess what? You can’t escape math in sales either—especially if you want to have success at any amount of scale greater than a single rep.

The first step on the road to a repeatable, scalable sales process is to build your narrative. That is, craft the “story” you will be presenting to your would-be customers, which will eventually take the form of slides, email templates, spoken messaging, website copy, videos and so forth. Because before you start creating those artifacts, you have to have the framework. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=479))

That is, identify the problem, who has it, how it is currently solved (or not), and why that’s unsatisfactory, followed by what has changed to make this problem solvable in a new way, what that means for the problem in question, how your new solution works to solve this problem, and what the quantitative and qualitative proof points are that validate this line of argumentation.

What is The Problem? You need to identify the business pain you’re seeking to solve, as crisply as possible, so your audience can quickly evaluate whether what you’re talking about is relevant to them. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=509))

For instance, in the case of TalentBin, “Technical recruiting is hard. It’s hard to find software engineering talent that has the relevant skills, and even if you can find them, getting in contact with them is tough. And once you’ve found and contacted talent, keeping on top of all those conversations can be a huge time suck fraught with dropped balls, all leading to slower hire times and raised cost of hire.” ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=511))

Who Has The Problem? Equally important is identifying the person who has the problem. We’ve already touched on this a little bit, since the person with the problem will often pop up in the problem statement—they’re somewhat hard to separate, and that’s fine. But you should know the players who are navigating, or trying to manage, the business hassles you’re tackling. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=535))

good rule of thumb for targeting the right stakeholders is to look for the person who has control of the budgetary resources allotted to resolve the pain point you solve. Or, alternatively, the person who spends meaningful amounts of time (i.e., labor resources), day to day, resolving that pain point.

What Are The Costs Associated With This Problem? Understanding the costs associated with the problem you’re addressing will help you frame an argument for why would-be customers should expend budget on your solution.

These benefits can sometimes be harder to prove, in that other actions must occur in order to realize the promised benefit. As such, they are sometimes referred to as “soft ROI.” ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=592))

Lastly, there may be more directional costs and opportunity costs and benefits. These are often harder to quantify. For instance, information technology vendors often sell the value of “increased agility”—that is, that users will be able to more quickly execute projects for their internal customers and thus allow the businesses they support to capture opportunities better. That’s great, but that’s a pretty big domino rally of cause and effect and hypothesized impact to take to the bank, and another example of “soft ROI.” ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=594))

How Do People Currently Solve This Problem? Why Do Current Solutions Fail? Knowing the current solution paths for your problem will be important, in that the thrust of your sales conversations will be to persuade your would-be customers that the means by which they currently solve the problem—or their continued non-solution of the problem—is insufficient for their business, and that they should be implementing your solution instead.

In these cases, you need to address the question of why that existing process is an inferior solution path. Often it comes down to the time cost associated with it and, beyond that, with the general frailty of process. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=620))

In the TalentBin case above, for example, the use of normal search engines in a manual process of candidate discovery is very time-consuming; while the outcomes could be valuable (a quality candidate hired), the time cost to get there may be substantial. Or a pertinent candidate may be missed, delaying the speed of hiring. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=622))

Solution via Service Providers A step beyond organizations that have implemented processes to resolve their business pains would be those doing so with service providers. For instance, rather than subscribing to a media database like Cision to help their PR team keep tabs on relevant journalists, an organization might just have a PR firm on retainer.

Lastly, we have the most advanced organizations, those that already are using products to solve the problem in question. These products won’t necessarily be pure “competition”—they might simply be in the same general space as yours—but this introduces a larger concept that includes competition.

QUALITATIVE/QUANTITATIVE PROOF OF A BETTER SOLUTION As you can see, each part of the narrative builds on the part before. This will be true for every piece of marketing collateral you produce—messaging, email and web copy, slide decks, and so on. And once you’ve covered “this is what has changed” and “this is how we take advantage of that change,” you’ll naturally want to get to “and here’s why we know our solution is better.” ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=691))

You’ll need to do this for each part of your offering’s value proposition. For instance, search discovery is only part of the workflow that a recruiter engages in. Outreach is another. When assessing how a product can help with candidate outreach, recruiters might be interested, for example, in email-address availability and the speed with which they can execute their outreach.

Approaches to Pricing In terms of taking early shots at pricing, there are a couple of ways to think about it. It’s more art than science early on, and you’ll typically blend a number of data points together. But these approaches can help you get started.

ROI & Value Pricing Another, more advanced, way to do pricing is known as “ROI pricing.” That is, determining the amount of value you expect to provide for the prospect and setting your price to capture some of that value. That’s not to say that pricing would change on a customer-by-customer basis necessarily (that adds unnecessary complication). But it means that you would be aiming to provide a certain amount of value above and beyond the cost of your solution.

First, you should be focused on your ideal customer profile right now (which we’ll discuss at length in Early Prospecting). You shouldn’t be engaging in sales conversations with accounts that are substantially different from one another.

The TalentBin Narrative What’s the problem? Technical recruiting is really hard! Finding software-engineering talent that has the skills that your organization requires, and then engaging with them to get them to consider your organization, is a tough problem. Who has the problem? What’s the cost of not solving the problem? It’s something that makes the lives of technical sourcers, recruiters, and recruiting managers rough, particularly because if they don’t solve the problem, they may have to pay large sums of money to recruiting agencies—25% of a first-year salary of $125,000 or more. Otherwise they don’t hire on schedule, and that impacts the ability of their organizations to ship software on time, and make revenue! How is this currently solved? Why doesn’t that work? Yes, you can use things like job boards or LinkedIn, but the problem is that unemployment is so low in software engineering that very few engineers are actively looking for jobs. And because most people don’t really pay attention to LinkedIn or update their profiles, software-engineering profiles have a tendency not to exist, or to be missing the skill information that indicates that the engineer in question would be a good fit. Not to mention the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of recruiters on LinkedIn messaging every engineer they can find, and that creates tons of noise to cut through. What has changed? But the good news is, the Internet has undergone some amazing changes of late to help make finding and engaging with these potential hires much easier and more effective. Because people are spending so much more time online, day in and out, on social sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Meetup and professional networks like GitHub and Stack Overflow—and because of the general move toward the digitization of work materials—there are reams and reams of information available. If properly leveraged, that material can help recruiters find talented individuals based on the activity they engage in online—for instance, tweeting about iOS development, being a member of an Android Meetup, participating in email lists about Java, and so on. (How does it work?) TalentBin scoops up all the information that individuals leave as digital fingerprints of their professional selves, analyzes it, and turns it into profiles for these individuals, with skill details and contact information. Then we let recruiters search and review the profiles and reach out to folks. How do you know it’s better? Because TalentBin makes use of these mountains of “implicit” professional activity, it solves the problem of finding individuals who are not searching for jobs, not present in job board resume databases, and undiscoverable on LinkedIn due to their thin profiles. For instance, for a typical search like “Ruby on Rails” in the San Francisco Bay Area, TalentBin returns 5x the number of results compared to LinkedIn Recruiter. Moreover, 60% of these profiles have personal email addresses, which are so, so… ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=865))

Starting with the “problem” section is helpful to your sales deck in the same way it helped start off your larger sales narrative—if the person to whom you’re presenting, when shown the problem your solution addresses, says, “Huh, I actually don’t have that problem,” then delightful! You’ve saved yourself and them the trouble of presenting a solution that doesn’t fit their business pain. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=1085))

This section of your deck is a great place to document not just the problem that you’re seeking to resolve, but also other validators of that problem and its importance.

It’s the one where the client actually had no clue what was being discussed but, because he didn’t want to admit that, just politely nodded along, committed to “follow up,” and promptly disappeared. Of course he disappeared. He never understood what was going on. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=1159))

find that the best way to prevent this is to include a section in your deck on what has changed in the market, and how it impacts clients and created the opportunity for your solution. As you walk through it, with the help of a visual, you can check in on comprehension and agreement, and confirm that the prospect is actually, indeed, following along and building consensus.

How Your Solution Works We already looked at examples of these slides when we were discussing extensibility, so no need to do it again here. I do want to add one point though, I find it key to include a conceptual visualization of how your solution works—to clearly establish the correct understanding—even before you get into specific pain points and their associated solutions. For instance, in TalentBin’s case, as so much flows from the aggregation of candidate profile data from across the web into a unified profile, it was very important to ensure that prospects comprehended how that process worked, or else they would have difficulty with the information that was built on this concept.

Quantitative/Qualitative Proof of a Better Solution Once you’ve made the case that existing solutions have problems—and that there are real opportunity costs of not solving them—the next step is presenting proof of your superior solution. If you’ve done a good job, you’ll make adoption of your solution look like a complete no-brainer by comparison.

This is also where you build your case for “why now?” The biggest challenge founders selling young products have is motivating any change at all. This is why you have to demonstrate a large cost or opportunity cost that the prospect is encountering every day that he doesn’t adopt your solution. These slides are the ones that really bring this point home. You’ll see below the crystallization of different types of opportunity cost related to TalentBin’s features, but you can also imagine a rollup of these that succinctly states, “This is why this solution is so much better than what you’re doing. It’s a no-brainer to act on this now.” ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=1193))

Quantitative Proof Again, extensibility is key here. You can share the most basic proof of superiority for a set of key metrics in a single slide, or you can go deeper on each section. The goal is for customers to look at this information and agree that your solution, as measured along a particular value vector, is far superior to their status quo.

Higher-level proof would be “rolled-up,” bottom-line, return-on-investment data, like reduced time to hire, reduced cost per hire, and so on. It’s important that this information is presented clearly, as prospects are faced with a variety of potential solutions they could be implementing to various different problems in their business.

Qualitative Proof While quantitative proof is usually the most impactful for B2B sales cycles, qualitative proof points can be helpful as well—and together, they make for an excellent one-two punch that hits both the left and right brain of your prospect. Traditionally these qualitative points come in the form of “customer success” materials. Like with quantitative proof points, they should correlate to ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PMK17Z1&location=1223))

Why This Will Be So Easy While the monetary cost of your solution will of course be a topic of great interest to your prospect, so too will be the potential time cost required to implement it. Most of your prospects, especially the more sophisticated ones, will have experience being promised the moon, stars, and the sky by sales reps. But then when reality ensued, they were eventually faced with all kinds of delays and implementation headaches and so on, all of which blocked their ability to capture the promised return on investment. So they’re going to want to know how do you make this easy? How do you make it such that they say “yes” and then magically everything proceeds from there?

Pricing As you go through your presentation, if you have qualified well and are drawing customers along, gaining their agreement throughout, they’re eventually going to want to talk financials. Having a slide that presents your solution’s pricing, and any potential variations, helps here, and also helps for when you send your slides along later for reference by the client.
