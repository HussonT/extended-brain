These companies don’t only invent something to sell us. They are not making products or services that just incrementally improve on whatever came before. They don’t sell us better. The most exciting companies sell us different. (Location 494)

“Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.” As you’ll see, he’s describing category kings—the companies that take all the economics out of a category. (Location 563)

“A category king tends to have broken open a new space, and that often means a big risk element early on—something most people think you can’t surmount, or that if you do surmount, no one will care,” he told us. A company like Snapchat might fall into that latter (Location 583)

Here’s the category king gap in a nutshell: Uber was valued at 51 billion in late 2015, while at about the same time the number two in that space, Lyft, was valued about 25 times lower, at 2 billion. The rest of that category was barely noticeable. (Location 634)

Most people, he explained, think of luck and skill in any particular endeavor as a zero-sum continuum—a straight line that puts luck at one end and skill at the other. That would mean that if you’d say that an outcome is determined by 40 percent luck, it must be 60 percent skill; or if it’s 90 percent luck, then the outcome must rely on only 10 percent skill. But luck and skill, Raymer insisted, “are not on the same axis.” And that makes all the difference. (Location 656)

Category design is not just engineering. Too many people in Silicon Valley believe that building a great product is enough, and that the market will find it and flock to it. That’s a disease that has infected even the best and brightest minds. In fact, the best product doesn’t always win the category. Different wins. Great category thinking wins. Best product gets you an award at a TechCrunch conference. Category design is also not just marketing. Category design is a company-wide strategy. It involves the CEO and top management, product designers, engineers, sales, marketing, PR, partners—and often customers and users, too. (Location 726)

Ten Reasons You Shouldn’t Read the Rest of This Book   1.   You think the company with the best product wins.   2.   You believe there is room for a lot of winners in a market, that a rising tide lifts all boats, and other feel-good hippy garbage.   3.   You’re okay with being good enough.   4.   You’re afraid to lean forward on your skis while you’re already going 80 miles per hour downhill.   5.   You’re an engineer who thinks marketing is what you do when you have a bush-league product.   6.   You’re a classically trained marketer who thinks reach and frequency win the game.   7.   You believe heady competition is the ideal.   8.   You think an IPO is just a financial event.   9.   You think you’re not in the technology business and never will be, so you don’t think tech industry dynamics apply—you know, the way the taxi industry used to think. 10.   You work at SAP.17 (Location 750)

Today the powerful transforming force is the category—creating a new market for a new product, often (but not always) from a new company. A great message, a great product, a great innovation—these things are no longer enough on their own. Now it’s critical to develop a great new market category in concert with building a great company and product. (Location 786)

A company that best frames a problem is the company that often comes to define and take the category. Put another way: winning companies today market the problem, not just the solution.

What does all this mean for a CEO, founder, or category creator of any kind? Your number one job is to change the way people think. Your product, your company culture, your marketing—everything has to be aligned with transforming the way potential customers think. If you change the way they think, they will change their buying behavior. More important, if you are the company that changes the way people think, people will see your company as the category king, and you will win the majority of the customers. (Location 911)

Once the category’s problem gets defined, the market demands the solution, and potential customers will turn to the consensus solution with ferocity. In a well-honed category-driven strategy, the company designs the category, evangelizes the problem, offers its solution to the problem, and then the category makes the company its king.

Few companies start on day one with all three points of the triangle firmly planned out. Some companies begin with a team that just wants to work together, essentially beginning with company design. Some companies get their start because an entrepreneur thinks up a new product, starting at product design. And some companies begin with a vision for a category—like Bhargava of 5-hour Energy, who then had to design a product and company to tackle the category. (Location 1011)

Category design is the discipline of creating and developing a new market category, and conditioning the market so it will demand your solution and crown your company as its king. (Location 1224)

Key traits of category design, which we’ll unpack in coming chapters: •      Category design drives the company’s strategy to become a category king. The strategy has to start with the CEO and her leadership team identifying the right category to create, making sure the product and company fit the category. •      Category design involves product and ecosystem design. That includes creating a blueprint that generates a belief that you have the solution to an urgent and giant problem. It means developing an environment around your product that wins loyalty and gratitude for the product and company. When you have tens of thousands of people attending an event like Salesforce.com’s Dreamforce, Facebook’s F8, or VMware’s VMworld, you know you sit atop a powerful category ecosystem. •      Category design is part of company culture. It is directly connected to the kind of company you build, the type of people you hire, and the type of community around the company including investors, partners, analysts, and journalists. It is the company’s point of view on the world. •      Category design is about creating a powerful and provocative story that causes customers or users to make a choice. The story evokes something different from what came before, not just better. •      Category design is marketing, public relations, and advertising when it is all focused on conditioning the market to desire and need whatever you’re giving it. The goal is to condition the market to have an aha that changes people’s consumption, usage, and buying decisions. This is much more than messaging and branding. •      Above all, category design is making all of these components work together, in lockstep, feeding off each other, so each action builds momentum for the category and its king. In that sense, category design is like a musical score for a symphony. Just as every part of the orchestra needs to play the score together, every part of the company needs to execute category design together. (Location 1228)

In 1999, he started doing that while Salesforce was still only a few coders working in a San Francisco apartment. Benioff invited Don Clark, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, to visit, but Benioff didn’t spend time selling his solution. He evangelized the problem. On July 21, 1999, the Journal ran Clark’s story on the front page. Headlined “Canceled Programs: Software Is Becoming an Online Service, Shaking Up an Industry,” the story marked a first step in conditioning the market to desire what Salesforce would eventually give (Location 1305)

about how to make a louder guitar.”5 Some of the best thinking about insights that we’ve encountered come from another early-stage investment firm, Floodgate, and its principals Ann Miura-Ko and Mike Maples.6 They look for one of two types of insights: market insights and technology insights. Here’s how that works: MARKET INSIGHTS: A market insight involves seeing a “missing” in the world at large and believing that technology can be built to solve it. (Location 1483)

Here’s how that works: MARKET INSIGHTS: A market insight involves seeing a “missing” in the world at large and believing that technology can be built to solve it. Les Paul had a market insight. He realized there was a need for an amplified guitar, believed that technology could be applied to fix that situation, and was overwhelmed by the feeling that he had to be the one to do it. He saw the need first, then built the technology to meet the need. Similarly, the Uber guys had a market insight, seeing the “missing” in taxicab hailing and believing technology could fix it.

TECHNOLOGY INSIGHTS: A technology insight usually comes from a scientist or engineer. The “missing” is entirely about the technology itself. An inventor sees a way to create something that’s never before existed, often hoping that a worthwhile problem can be found that the invention will solve. “Technology doesn’t always translate into product power,” Miura-Ko tells us. “Technology can be in search of a problem.” (Location 1529)

Can you explain what problem you’re trying to solve? To create a category, that problem needs to be one that people didn’t realize they had or didn’t realize they could solve. If your company solves this problem perfectly, what category are you in? It needs to be a category that doesn’t exist and that you have the ability to create. It must be nonconsensus or you are by default a follower. If you win 85 percent of that category, what’s the size of your category potential? The answer tells the world how big your company can become and how much your company will matter. Are you Pixar in its first phase, with a category potential of three hundred machines?

We’d ask them a series of targeted questions to get them to talk about eleven different facets of the company. Those facets: Vision mission: What was the original market or technology insight that led you to create this company? Customers: Who do you envision buying this product or service? Who will use it? Problem statement: What’s the problem you think you can solve for your potential customers? Use cases: What are the specific ways people will use this product or service to solve their problem? Product/solution: Give a detailed explanation of the technology behind the solution—what does it do now, and what else is it capable of doing? Ecosystem: In many cases there are other companies involved in solving the problem or adding additional value. These companies form an ecosystem around the problem and solution. What are all the companies and where in the ecosystem are the control points where one company has leverage? Competition: Who else is trying to solve this problem—or, if no one else sees the problem yet, who might jump in to compete with you to solve the problem once you identify it? Business model: How will your product or service change business for your customers? Will it increase their return on investment or reduce costs in a significant way? Or does it allow them to do something that couldn’t have been done with prior technology, creating huge value? Sales and go-to-market: Enterprise companies should articulate how the product or solution will make its way to the market. Through a sales force? Through distribution partners? Both? For a consumer company, how will users find out about your solution? From app stores? Search? Viral adoption? Growth hacking techniques? Advertising? PR? Organization: How is the company organized? Who are the major influencers on the company? How are decisions made? What kind of culture will work? Funding strategy: What’s the next funding event? A private financing? An IPO? How much runway does the company have before it needs more money and what kind of funding is in place to execute against the category strategy? (Location 1612)

The Play Bigger Guide to Category Discovery and Expression Step One: Start with “Who” The first question: Who is going to lead the work to discover and name the category? Certainly the founders or CEO must be completely committed to the work, but in most cases they aren’t the right choices for actually doing the work. Just as it’s tough to psychoanalyze yourself, it’s tough for a founding team to back away and look at the company with fresh eyes, avoiding tangles of politics, product features, and emotions.

We package the discussions and information gained during the workshop into a category design document. The document addresses the following topics: Category Landscape—what the category you create would look like and where it fits. Category Ecosystem—the customers, competitors, developers, suppliers, analysts, media, and everyone else who would plug into the category. Frotos—the from/to journey you want customers to take. Category Name and Description—the final version. The Case for the New Category—write out why the category should exist and what the world will look like if the company creates and dominates the category. Early Draft Game Plan—a sketch of how the company can create and dominate the category. (Location 1804)
