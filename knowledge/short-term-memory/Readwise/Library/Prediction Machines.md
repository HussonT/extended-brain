Just as in biodiversity, the diversity of prediction machines involves a trade-off between individual and system-level outcomes. ([Location 2830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075GXJPFS&location=2830))

We have already discussed the benefits of implementing prediction on the ground rather than in the cloud for the purpose of faster context-dependent learning (at the cost of more accurate predictions overall) and to protect consumer privacy.

Microsoft was using the Google toolbar for learning-by-using to develop better algorithms for its Bing search engine. Much of what users did was search Google and then click on those results. So when a search term was rare and only found on Google (like “hiybbprqag”) and if it was used enough (precisely what the Google engineers were doing), Microsoft’s machine ended up learning it. Interestingly, what Microsoft had not been doing—which it clearly could have—was learn how Google search terms translated into clicks to imitate completely Google’s search engine.

The strategic issue is that when you have an AI (like Google’s search engine), then if a competitor can observe data being entered (such as a search query) and output being reported (such as a list of websites), then it has the raw materials to employ its own AI to engage in supervised learning and reconstruct the algorithm.

On the positive side, such attacks leave a trail. It is necessary to query the prediction machine many times to understand it. Unusual quantities of queries or an unusual diversity of queries should raise red flags. ([Location 2862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075GXJPFS&location=2862))

Prediction machines carry risks. Any company that invests in AI will face these risks, and eliminating all of them is impossible. There is no easy solution. You now have the knowledge to anticipate these risks. Be aware of how your predictions differ across groups of people.

AI carries many types of risk. We summarize six of the most salient types here. Predictions from AIs can lead to discrimination. Even if such discrimination is inadvertent, it creates liability. AIs are ineffective when data is sparse. This creates quality risk, particularly of the “unknown known” type, in which a prediction is provided with confidence, but is false. Incorrect input data can fool prediction machines, leaving their users vulnerable to attack by hackers. Just as in biodiversity, the diversity of prediction machines involves a trade-off between individual- and system-level outcomes. Less diversity may benefit individual-level performance, but increase the risk of massive failure. Prediction machines can be interrogated, exposing you to intellectual property theft and to attackers who can identify weaknesses. Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behavior. ([Location 2886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075GXJPFS&location=2886))

Other judgment-related jobs will be more widespread, but perhaps less skilled than the jobs the AIs replace. Many of today’s highest-paid careers have prediction as a core skill, including those of doctors, financial analysts, and lawyers.

If AI is a new, efficient form of capital, then the capital share of the economy will likely continue to rise at the expense of labor. No easy solutions exist for this problem. For example, Bill Gates’s suggestion to tax robots will reduce inequality but will make buying robots less profitable.

A second trend leading to increased inequality is that technology is often skill-biased. It disproportionately increases the wages of highly educated people and might even decrease the wages of the less educated.

The policy challenges are not simple: increased education is costly. Such costs need to be paid, either by higher taxes or by businesses and individuals directly. Even if the costs could be easily covered, many middle-aged people might not be eager to return to school. ([Location 2987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075GXJPFS&location=2987))

If AI has scale economies, that will not affect all industries equally. If your firm is successful and established, chances are prediction accuracy is not the only thing that made it successful. The abilities or assets that make it valuable today will likely still be valuable when paired with AI. AI should enhance an airline’s ability to provide personalized customer service as well as to optimize flight times and prices. However, it’s not at all obvious that the airline with the best AI will have such an advantage that it will dominate all its competitors.

If AI has scale advantages, reducing the negative effects of monopoly involves trade-offs. Breaking up monopolies reduces the scale, but scale makes AI better. Again, policy is not simple.10 ([Location 3030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075GXJPFS&location=3030))

So long as interests compete, competition will flourish, meaning that the paper-clip AI will likely find it more profitable to trade for resources than fight for them and, as if guided by an invisible hand, will end up promoting benefits distinct from its original intention.

The rise of AI presents society with many choices. Each represents a tradeoff. At this stage, while the technology is still in its infancy, there are three particularly salient trade-offs at the society level. The first trade-off is productivity versus distribution. Many have suggested that AI will make us poorer or worse off. That’s not true. Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity. AI will unambiguously enhance productivity. The problem isn’t wealth creation; it’s distribution. AI might exacerbate the income inequality problem for two reasons. First, by taking over certain tasks, AIs might increase competition among humans for the remaining tasks, lowering wages and further reducing the fraction of income earned by labor versus the fraction earned by the owners of capital. Second, prediction machines, like other computer-related technologies, may be skill-biased such that AI tools disproportionately enhance the productivity of highly skilled workers. The second trade-off is innovation versus competition. Like most software-related technologies, AI has scale economies. Furthermore, AI tools are often characterized by some degree of increasing returns: better prediction accuracy leads to more users, more users generate more data, and more data leads to better prediction accuracy. Businesses have greater incentives to build prediction machines if they have more control, but, along with scale economies, this may lead to monopolization. Faster innovation may benefit society from a short-term perspective but may not be optimal from a social or longer-term perspective. The third trade-off is performance versus privacy. AIs perform better with more data. In particular, they are better able to personalize their predictions if they have access to more personal data. The provision of personal data will often come at the expense of reduced privacy. Some jurisdictions, like Europe, have chosen to create an environment that provides their citizens with more privacy. That may benefit their citizens and may even create conditions for a more dynamic market for private information where individuals can more easily decide whether they wish to trade, sell, or donate their private data. On the other hand, that may create frictions in settings where opting in is costly and disadvantages European firms and citizens in markets where AIs with better access to data are more competitive. For all three trade-offs, jurisdictions will have to weigh both sides of the trade and design policies that are most aligned with their overall strategy and the preferences of their citizenry.
