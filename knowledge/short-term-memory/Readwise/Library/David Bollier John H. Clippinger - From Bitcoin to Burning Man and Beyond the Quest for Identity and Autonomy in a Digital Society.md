OMS enables groups to form and govern their own micro-economies—self-regulating, self-healing networks that can create their own forms of cooperation, including digital currencies, user-driven markets and social affinity groups. OMS is thus a new vehicle for us to build and scale our own interoperable communities of interest and markets – intimately, securely and at a global scale. (Location 39)

conStant theme throughout human hiStory is a deep-seated yearn-ing for a just, perfectible, and virtuous society. The recurrent challenge to this dream is how to achieve such a goal in a secular, imper-fect world. For every optimistic vision (Plato’s Republic, Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Social Contract, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s very American ideal of “self reliance,” Karl Marx classless society in Communist Manifesto, and B.F. Skinner’s Walden II) and there is the countervailing pragmatist, even cynic’s skepticism (Niccolo Machiavelli’s The Prince, Samuel Butler’s Erewhon). Inevitably, such grand visions become dashed against the hard realities of the inherent weaknesses, indeed archaic drives, of human nature. (Location 84)

What once required the authority of a central bank or a sovereign authority can now be achieved through open, distributed crypto-algorithms. National borders, traditional legal regimes and human intervention are increasingly moot. Bitcoin’s challenge to the banking world and Burning Man’s challenge to social convention are not isolated phenomena. They are harbingers of an inexorable change in how all aspects human affairs are going to be conducted and governed. They point to new types of governance institutions, new, more participatory roles for individuals and communities, and a new ethic and worldview. (Location 110)

What is clear is that we are seeing a new kind of highly distributed, self-governing infrastructure that profoundly alters one of the most fundamental precepts of human social and economic organization – the formal recognition and management of identities, access rights to resources and the management of risk. In this new data ecology, virtually anything can become a “digital asset” – identities, currencies, securities, contracts, mortgages, derivatives, goods, services, rewards, genome, licenses, titles, certificates, and much more.

When traditional governance institutions and mechanisms are embedded in a data ecology, many forms of corruption, collusion, fraud, free riders, deception and coercion issues can be addressed through the “mechanism design” of institutions, policies and practices. These autonomous mechanisms can provably resolve, or at least, reduce the incidence of these failures. What until the present has had to be framed as an intractable “political matter” around oversight, fair representation, rule making and adjudication, can now be replaced or at least supplemented by algorithms and software agents with highly focused, independent and accountable human oversight.

Part I, “Charting the New Ecology of Data,” provides an introductory framework for understanding the power of distributed computing, the growth of mass participation and the rise of Big Data as a standard element – all of which are converging to create new sorts of institutions, governance and even human identity. Introduction xv One of the most important innovations to arise from these trends is explored in Part II, “Digital Currencies as Instruments for Social Change.” This part of the book describes the importance of complementary currencies, the significance of Bitcoin, and the other potentially transformative currencies that are now emerging, including the Ven, the proposed Impala for Africa and Green Coins to foster environmental improvements. Finally, Part III, “Open Architectures for an Open Society,” explores some of the conceptual and technical design issues that must be addressed in building an open, stable, civically robust and innovation-friendly future. The essays of this section build on the logic of the first two sections by explaining the importance of holistic system design (“holonics”), the lessons of self-governance for common-pool resources, and the ways in which Open Mustard Seed – the new software platform developed by ID3 – seeks to empower users to control their own data and build their own trusted governance systems.

ODESS modes of software and services are im-mensely popular because they do not require external institutional authorities – i.e., corruptible human third parties – to function effectively. Rather they are “self-reflexive” in that they contain within themselves the necessary mechanisms to host, verify and clear transactions, and to audit themselves and self-correct errors and breaches.

Media Lab, that on open networks such as the Internet, greater value is generated through groups that are progressively more coherent and collaborative – or what Reed calls “Group Forming Networks,” or GFNs. While the lowest level of value-creation occurs through a broadcasting model based on “best content,” and a higher level of value can be generated through a network of peer-to-peer transactions based on collectives with the “most members,” the most valuable networks, says Reed, are those that facilitate group affiliations.

it is clear that the best way to unlock enormous stores of value on networks is to develop tools that can facilitate GFNs. As Bollier and Clippinger write: “This will be the next great Internet disruption. But to achieve this, we must develop a network architecture and software systems that can build trust and social capital in user-centric, scalable ways.” A good way to help the Internet achieve its true growth and value potential is to adopt new mechanisms for authentication and governance. As a starting point, Bollier and Clippinger point to the eight design principles for managing commons-pool resources that the late Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom identified after decades of studying such forms of governance.

Any successful commons, according to Ostrom’s design principles, must be able to define the boundaries of its community and governance; align the governance rules with local needs and conditions; and ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules. People must also be able to monitor compliance with rules, sanction free riders and vandals, and provide low-cost systems for resolving disputes – among other principles. (Location 222)

In Chapter 10, the idea of a green currency – Green Coins – is proposed by former FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt who is now CEO of the Coalition for Green Capital, and his associates at the Coalition, Jeffrey Schub and Joseph R. Schottenfeld. Working through the nonprofit Coalition for Green Capital, the authors are exploring how a solar cryptocurrency based on some of the design principles of Bitcoin, especially a distributed ledger, might be used to incentivize the adoption of solar power, especially among homeowners.

of holistic, living systems, natural and constructed, whose constitutive elements are mutually defining, expressive and constantly evolving. In actual circumstances, the individual cannot be cast as against, below or above the group; the individual is in fact nested within dynamic forms of social organization. Living organisms have subjectivities, inter-subjectivities and behaviors that are nested within larger living systems.” (Location 295)

Ulieru’s mission as a holonics scholar is to jolt us out of our conventional understandings of physical and human dynamics, and point us to the complex, dynamic rules and laws of self-organizing systems. She helps us to understand the limitations of organizational hierarchies and to appreciate institutions as living systems embedded in larger social and ecological contexts. (Location 300)

By adopting this perspective, we can begin to blend multiple scientific and humanistic disciplines and focus on the role of the holarchy to understand how emergent, self-organized agents can collaborate in advancing a common purpose.

The general technical framework of OMS is outlined in Chapter 13 by Thomas Hardjono, Technical Lead and Executive Director of the M.I.T. Consortium for Kerberos and Internet Trust; Patrick Deegan, Chief Technology Officer of ID3 and Lead Architect of OMS; and John H. Clippinger, Executive Director and CEO of ID3 and Research Scientist at the M.I.T. Media Lab Human Dynamics Group. Hardjono et al. describe how the various elements of the trust framework – open authentication, storage, discovery, payment, auditing, market making and monetized “app store” services – all work together in an integrated fashion. What makes OMS so distinctive is its “privacy by design” principles – that is, absolute privacy, security and trusted exchange are built into the very design of the system. (Location 323)

identity infrastructure or the means by which individuals could assert control over their personal data. He argues that because the current infrastructure cannot be simply uprooted and replaced, any envisioned “authentication, privacy and sharing layer” has to grow organically on top of the existing layer. Fortunately, this is now possible by combining technologies for the self-deployment and administration of services with new encryption, identity authentication and access controls technologies and protocols. The Open Mustard Seed (OMS) platform represents an open source effort to enable such an architecture on a global scale. (Location 332)

To assure that these new types of self-organized governance can take root and blossom on the Web, Harry Halpin argues that the logic of digitization and open networks requires a “new grammar” of open standards to assure that freedom and innovation can flourish. Halpin is Research Scientist at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C/M.I.T.), where he leads efforts in cryptography and social standards. Halpin writes that an open social Web is critical to the future of self-organized behaviors and secure digital identity: “To prevent the centralization of our data in the hands of a neo-feudal digital regime and all the dangers that this entails, we urgently need to construct a new ecosystem of open standards to allow secure forms of digital identity that everyone from individuals to institutions can deploy without being ‘locked-in’ to existing players.” (Location 337)

Instead, we should think of the economy as an exchange network: a complex web of specific exchange relationships. In fact the idea of a market, in which it is imagined that all the participants can see and compete evenly with everyone else, is almost always an oversimplification. (Location 381)

In exchange networks, buyers and sellers can more easily build up the trust that makes society resilient in times of great stress. In markets, one must usually rely on having access to an accurate reputation mechanism that rates all the participants, or to an outside referee to enforce the rules. (Location 396)

This insight comes from what I call social physics: using game theory to mathematically examine the properties of human societies, such as comparing a society based on exchange networks with one based on markets. For instance, the equations from the thesis of my PhD student Ankur Mani show that the dynamics of exchange networks structurally favor fair outcomes, with the surplus generated by the relationship equally divided between the individuals involved.

[3] As a consequence of fairness, there is more stability and greater levels of trust. Exchange networks are also more cooperative, robust and resilient to outside shocks. Social physics provides a good recipe for building a society that will survive. (Location 402)

Social physics strongly suggests that the invisible hand is more due to the trust, cooperation and robustness properties of the person-to-person network of exchanges than it is due to any magic in the workings of the market. If we want to have a fair, stable society, we need to look to the network of exchanges between people, and not to market competition. (Location 406)

How can we move from a market-centric to a human-centric society? So how does this idea of an exchange society apply to modern life? Today we have mass media to spread information, and our much higher levels of mobility allow us to interact with many more people. Information is so universally available and our social networks are 6 FROM BITCOIN TO BURNING MAN AND BEYOND extremely broad. Do these facts mean that we have transitioned from an exchange society to a market society? I think the answer is no. (Location 409)

Even though we now have much greater breadth and rate of interaction, our habits still depend mostly on interactions with a few trusted sources—those people whom we interact with frequently— and for each person the number of such trusted individuals remains quite small. In fact, the evidence is that the number of trusted peers that we have today is pretty much the same as it was tens of thousands of years ago.[4] (Location 414)

How can we use these insights about human nature to design a society better suited to human nature? Economic theory still provides a useful template for shaping our society, but we have to begin with a more accurate notion of human nature. Because we are not just economic creatures, our vision of a human-centric society must include a broader range of human motivations – such as curiosity, trust, and social pressure. (Location 421)

Social physics suggests that the first step is to focus on the flow of ideas rather than on the flow of wealth, since the flow of ideas is the source of both cultural norms and innovation. A focus on improving idea flow, rather than financial flows, will allow individuals to make better decisions and our society to develop more useful behavioral norms. A key insight from social physics is that it is critical that the flow and exchange of ideas be inclusive, because insufficiently diverse idea flow leads to rigid and insular societies, and insular communities (including the society of Adam Smith’s time) often inflict terrible damage on weaker communities with whom they share resources.

Idea Flow Idea flow is the spreading of ideas, whether by example or story, through a social network—be it a company, a family, or a city. Being part of this flow of ideas allows people to learn new behaviors without the dangers or risks of individual experimentation. People can also acquire large integrated patterns of behavior without having to form them gradually through laborious experimentation. (Location 435)

In fact, humans rely so much on our ability to learn from the ideas that surround us that some psychologists refer to us as Homo imitans. The collective intelligence of a community comes from idea flow; we learn from the ideas that surround us, and others learn from us. Over time, a community with members who actively engage with each other creates a group with shared, integrated habits and beliefs. (Location 438)

Because “idea flow” takes into account the variables of a social network structure, the strength of social influence between people, and individual susceptibilities to new ideas, it also serves another vital role: It gives a reliable, mathematical prediction of how changing any of these variables will change the performance of all the people in the network. Thus, the mathematical framework of idea flow allows us to tune social networks in order to make better decisions and achieve better results. (Location 443)

For example, what can be done when the flow of ideas becomes either too sparse and slow or too dense and fast? How does the “exploration” process—using social networks to search for ideas and then winnow them down to just a few good ones—result in a harvest of ideas that produces good decisions?

How Can We Harvest the Best Ideas? The exploration process is fundamentally a search for new ideas within one’s social network, so to understand how to find the best 8 FROM BITCOIN TO BURNING MAN AND BEYOND ideas I launched two big data studies that contain almost two million hours of interaction data covering everyone within two communities for a total of over two years. These studies allowed me to build quantitative, predictive models of how we humans find and incorporate new ideas into our decisions. (Location 451)

The studies paint a picture of humans as sailors. We all sail in a stream of ideas, ideas that are the examples and stories of the peers who surround us; exposure to this stream shapes our habits and beliefs. We can resist the flow if we try, and even choose to row to another stream, but most of our behavior is shaped by the ideas we are exposed to. The idea flow within these streams binds us together into a sort of collective intelligence, one comprised of the shared learning of our peers. (Location 456)

The continual exploratory behavior of humans is a quick learning process that is guided by apparent popularity among peers. In contrast, adoption of habits and preferences is a slow process that requires repeated exposure and perceptual validation within a community of peers. Our social world consists of the rush and excitement of new ideas harvested through exploration, and then the quieter and slower process of engaging with peers in order to winnow through those ideas, to determine which should be converted into personal habits and social norms.

Sometimes they are sailing in swift, clear streams where the ideas are abundant, but sometimes they are in stagnant pools or ter-rifying whirlpools. At other times, one person’s idea stream forks off, splitting it apart from other people and taking them in a new direction.

When the flow of ideas incorporates a constant stream of outside ideas as well, then the individuals in the community make better decisions than they could on their own.

Social learning is critical. Copying other people’s successes, when combined with individual learning, is dramatically better than individual learning alone. When your individual information is unclear, rely more on social learning; when your individual information is strong, rely less on social learning. (Location 471)

One disturbing implication of these findings is that our hyper-connected world may be moving toward a state in which there is too much idea flow. In a world of echo chambers, fads and panics are the norm, and it is much harder to make good decisions. (Location 473)

We need to pay much more attention to where our ideas are coming from, and we should actively discount common opinions and keep track of the contrarian ideas. (We can build software tools to help us do this automatically, but to do so we have to keep track of the provenance of ideas.) (Location 475)

Contrarians are important. When people are behaving independently of their social learning, it is likely that they have independent information and that they believe in that information enough to fight the effects of social influence. Find as many of these “wise guys” as possible and learn from them. (Location 477)

Diversity is important. When everyone is going in the same direction, then it is a good bet that there isn’t enough diversity in your information and idea sources, and you should explore further. A big danger of social learning is groupthink. To avoid groupthink and echo chambers, you have to compare what the social learning suggests with what isolated individuals (who have only external information sources) are doing. If the so-called common sense from social learning is just an overconfi-dent version of what isolated people think, then you are likely (Location 482)

But it is also important to diversify by considering more than one strategy at a time because, as our environment changes, the old strategies stop working and new strategies take the lead. Therefore, it is not the strategies that have been most successful that you want to follow; it is really the strategies that will be most successful that you have to find. And since predicting the future is hard, diversification of social learning is important. (Location 488)

In summary, people act like idea-processing machines combining individual thinking and social learning from the experiences of others. Success depends greatly on the quality of your exploration and that, in turn, relies on the diversity and independence of your information and idea sources. By harvesting from the parts of our social network that touch other streams, that is, by crossing what sociologist Ron Burt called the “structural holes” within the fabric of society, we can create innovation. When we choose to dip into a different stream, we bring up new habits and beliefs, and it is these innovations that help us make better decisions, and help our community to thrive. (Location 492)
