All fundraising efforts and meetings have an element of good news and bad news. How you deal with them and learn from them is what really matters. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=97))

The earlier the stage your company is in, the more fundraising is about your ability to develop personal relationships and articulate your ambitions as a coherent story (aka. storytelling). ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=112))

In effect, there are two main drivers behind why an investor will be drawn to you in the early days: FOMO (fear of missing out) and/or your growth metrics. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=113))

Developing a fundraising mindset centers around four core ideas: Plan ahead. Fundraising is a process that can take time and is rarely quick or painless (with the exception of a select few). The earlier you start planning your process and developing relationships, the better off you will be, and the more likely you are to avoid fundraising in “desperation mode.” Expect rejection. You have to embrace rejection as part of the process and not take it personally. Rejection will happen, for good reasons, dumb reasons and, many times, for reasons that will remain forever a mystery. Practice makes perfect. Every meeting is a form of practice that makes you better for the next meeting; the success or failure of one meeting is never the end of your story, just a step along the way. Learn from the past. Analyzing what was said during your meetings and learning how to improve on your mistakes is the most crucial step in finding the right investor more quickly. Just like you analyze your company’s metrics, keep track of how people connected with your pitch; write down all the questions you were asked (a very good way of ascertaining which areas of your pitch are still ambiguous), and make sure you follow up on any information requests. Also, if you do get asked several types of questions often, it’s a chance to consider incorporating them into your presentation earlier or adding them to your appendix.

Your idea is of no use to you or your team if you run out of money before making it a reality. As you’ll read in the later chapters on milestones, there is a way to address the fear of not having your product at the level you want it to be when speaking to investors.

Setting the Right Milestones While your company’s journey will be a series of expected and unexpected events (hopefully more good than bad) over a period of time, investors will typically want to hear your “projections” as a coherent linear strategy (the old expression goes “investors invest in lines, not dots”, dots being data points, and lines being the trend between them). Better investors know that early-stage startups are fraught with uncertainty and thus will only use your stated strategy as a starting and discussion point. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=179))

Determining projected milestones for your company will serve both to determine your financing needs, and to start a conversation between founders. You will figure out what should happen when, and how you should use your resources. To be precise, I am defining a milestone as a future “marker” or quantifiable achievement within your company’s stated growth trajectory, not just a major accomplishment at some vague future time.

Investors are constantly trying to find the least risky point at which to invest. As such, some of the best times for a company to fundraise are either right before or right after the completion of a key milestone, but before so much time passes that the recently achieved milestone is no longer impressive.

While this makes obvious sense, only companies that instill a strong confidence and “fear of missing out” (FOMO) in potential investors regarding the company’s growth or value post-milestone completion can get investors rushing to get this kind of deal done.

If you can make this happen for your company, you’re in a great position, because generally, a product-launch milestone is easier for you to control than, say, a specific user growth rate after your product’s launch.

The art of selecting the right moment for fundraising is a matter of determining which key milestones to focus on and how to communicate them during your meetings with potential investors. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=226))

The Four Types of Milestones 1. Human resources A first milestone could be hiring key people who will make a strong impact on your organization (a super-hot marketing person, for example) or, if your team is a power-team already, who will provide sufficient reason for new investors to want to invest. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=229))

Every startup will eventually need a functioning management team consisting of CEO, CTO, COO, VP Sales, VP Marketing, and possibly some others, depending on what you’re building. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=234))

Product: Product launches vs. incremental version releases Examples include: proof that you can build something, i.e. working prototype; launch of a major enabler for a step-change in customer acquisition. Note that there is a difference between milestones that you might articulate to an investor (say, a major release with key functionality), and those that are on your product roadmap (say, a “point” release that does an important, but less visibly impactful thing).

Market: Market validation (first customers, first paying customers, etc.) Examples include: proof you have access to your target audience (100,000, 1 million or 10 million users); proof that the product or service is useful to someone (first users and clients); proof that there is market ($1 million revenue annually); proof that you can scale ($10 million revenue annually); proof that the market is big ($25 million revenue annually and beyond)!

4. Funding: Money being committed to a round that the investor in question can lead or participate in Examples include: proof that you can talk to investors (every financing round, even small ones); proof that the ecosystem agrees with your ideas (bringing respected industry advisors or partnerships on board); proof that you can manage your finances (cash flow positive operation).

Fundraising Challenge: Geography An old parable tells of a man who was traveling. He came upon a farmer working in his field and asked him what the people in the next village were like. The farmer asked, “What were the people like in the last village you visited?” The man responded, “They were kind, friendly, generous, great people.” “You’ll find the people in the next village are the same,” said the farmer. Another man who was traveling to the same village came up to the same farmer later on and asked him what the people in the next village were like. Again the farmer asked, “What were the people like in the last village you visited?” The second man responded, “They were rude, unfriendly, dishonest people.” “You’ll find the people in the next village are the same,” said the farmer.

Identifying milestones for your company’s development has a myriad of benefits aside from those associated with fundraising. First, planning milestones allows you to focus on what you will be working on and drive hard to achieve it. Second, the process of identifying and planning milestones forces you to question when and in what order you and your team should try to execute something. Lastly, having your milestones laid out is useful for tying together what you need to accomplish with how much money it will take to get there, and thus fundraise accordingly.

Keeping Milestone Optionality During your milestone definition exercise with your founders, consider doing what I call “keeping milestone optionality”. The principle is very simple: even as you plan your company’s future growth and associated cash needs, you can’t lose sight of the fact that you’re a nimble startup—not a large corporation that has to report to analysts and public market shareholders. Your nimbleness is your strength. As mentioned earlier, a startup’s growth plan isn’t linear (even if sometimes you need to communicate it that way); it’s more like a series of zig-zags towards a goal. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=270))

In a later chapter, we will cover in more detail the reasons why you should try to avoid tranched investments (investments broken out into parts and released based on pre-determined conditions), but let’s briefly cover why here. If you consider a tranche as a glorified milestone, adhering dogmatically to it early on could have a negative impact. Why? Well, because endeavoring to meet the scheduled conditions may constrain your company’s growth options, even if midway through executing your stated strategy it turns out that it was a bad idea for the company to have the goal agreed upon for the release of the tranche.

More investment terms and more due diligence. It is probably a fair statement to say that the more money involved, the more investment provisions an investor will want, as well as more “process” to make sure their money isn’t going to be misused.

“high” implied post-money valuation2or alternatively, higher dilution up front. In order to accommodate a large round, investors need to adjust your valuation accordingly if they don’t want to wash you and your founders out.

A propensity to misuse “easy money”. You could argue this point from a psychological perspective if you wanted to, but suffice to say, I know many VCs who believe over-funding a company leads to financial laxity, lack of focus, and overspending by the management team.

The media’s reaction (positive or negative) to how much money you’ve raised relative to what you have achieved. This one is hard to really quantify and happens only to very few startups. For example, in 2012, a serial entrepreneur raised $41 million out of the starting blocks for a company called Color. Even by 2020 standards, this is a large number! Unfortunately, the app went nowhere and didn’t satisfy the promise expected of it for that kind of money, making it, at the time, the source of many jokes about the perils of raising too much money early on (Color eventually shut down a year after its re-launch).

Let’s look at this question from a different point of view. As we will cover later on during the section on how an investor evaluates your financial plan, an investor may not necessarily know the exact figures your business will need to grow to its next major milestone. Instead, to some extent, an investor will rely on your ability to communicate your financial plan and review your cash needs relative to your stated goals.

I’ve used a $10,000 cash burn on this example up to the end of Year 1, then starting in Year 2, I’ve used a $20,000 monthly cash burn. Thinking this part through is critical; if you raise less money than necessary for a major milestone, you’ll likely fall short of cash at a time when your company doesn’t have anything outstanding to show for an investor to be impressed.

Monthly cash burn, or the amount of money you “burn” through each month in aggregate, is a key figure to know before meeting any investor. If you don’t know what your monthly cash burn is, you’re in trouble, as you will likely struggle to have a good dialogue about cash needs and representative accomplishments.

If I ask for the amount I truly need, but that is above what investors are willing to give, doesn’t it automatically set me up for a “no” and then having to backtrack? If I ask for a smaller amount, won’t investors know that I need more money than what I’m asking for? If I ask for too little, will I sound like I don’t know what I’m doing? What’s the best way to kick off the conversation with an investor in a non-hub market about my desire to raise more capital if available, but my willingness to take less cash and make the best of it? How do I avoid getting pigeon-holed into either being not a big enough thinker or having priced myself out of the local market?

So the longer answer is: you need to really invest time in pre-qualifying whom you talk to, understand whether they can “afford” to invest (or not) in your round, and make sure you know how to address the key concerns they may have for the stage of risk they perceive you are in. One thing you should never do is compromise on your “vision” for the company. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=369))

Within these geographies (e.g. the Valley and London, to name a couple), you need to be able to tell a story that gets your company to Billion Dollar ambitions to really excite key funds.

want my company to accomplish ‘x’ over the next few years, but in the near term, I believe we can get to ‘y’ and in order to do so, we are raising ‘z’.” By phrasing the cash request conversation this way, you’ve avoided sounding like you’re asking for too much, too early vis-a-vis this fictitious investor’s risk profile, and have demonstrated you understand that you need to achieve things before you can likely go fundraising again.

Valuation is closely linked to the amount of money you raise through a simple equation: money raised / post-money valuation of the round = percentage dilution of the round.

Keeping Materials Lean In order to go fundraising, you will need communication materials: materials others will use to introduce you to potential investors, materials for you to send investors that show more details about your strategy, financially and execution-wise, and lastly, materials that show the current equity structure between founders.

While there are many different opinions as to what constitutes the ideal set of materials for fundraising, I’m proposing the list below as the absolute minimum (you’ll see why shortly): A “one-pager”, in a mobile-device-friendly format (most investors will likely see your plan for the first time on a phone) that contains the absolutely critical facts about your company. This one-pager doesn’t have to be in any format—it literally could simply be text that encapsulates what you are working on. Increasingly I’m seeing the use of Notion or other notetaking-to-publish type decks, and while they can “work”, make sure they are readable easily on a small screen. The pitch deck you will use when presenting verbally. Naturally, you’ll have to develop the verbal pitch that accompanies this deck. The pitch deck that will have more detail and is based on #2 above, but that will still make sense to an investor even without your verbal presentation. This could be simply the one above but with an appendix. Your financial assumptions model, to showcase how you are thinking through cash use. Your cap table, to show the equity distribution between your team members. Your online profile on AngelList, Twitter, etc. and other meaningful platforms that are typically used to learn more about your company.

Your One-Pager When you go to the movies and see an epic trailer, you’re naturally drawn to want to see the movie when it launches. Similarly, the purpose of your “one-pager” (I use quotes because it may not literally be a PDF or “page” as such, but you get the idea) is to entice the recipient to want to learn more about what you’re doing with the least amount of effort and information possible, as an investor’s attention is at a premium early on with the many deal options available to them.

Any plan/deck should, at the bare minimum, include: A clear representation of the problem you are solving and for whom. Knowing your customer and why they need what you offer and why you will rise to the top of their mind is critical to convey quickly. An overview of who you are and what you’ve done (basically, why you and your team can make this happen). A succinct explanation of what your product/service does. Use screenshots if possible; run it past a non-techie friend and see if they can explain it back to you. A market overview section. The market size of your opportunity, key players, competitors, partnerships, target market7, etc. A snapshot of your financials. Effectively, how you will use your cash, which in an early-stage startup will be your expectations of cash usage. This section will likely require you to also highlight how you think you will likely make money. If your business is about growth first, clearly show your potential investors how much money you will need to grow the company to where it hits the tipping point. Competitive differentiation. How you bring value to your customers (the pain points) as well as how you differentiate from competitors in your market.

The company’s communication style and ability to articulate what they (their product or service) do, clearly and succinctly. Does the company rely too much on buzzwords and/or comparisons to get the point across, or are objectives and vision clearly discernible? Is the plan well written and free of grammatical errors? When I walk away from reading it, can I describe the opportunity in simple terms to others? How do they use visuals? What kind of style does the company have? The company’s ability to research their market size, competitors, key industry players, distribution channels, etc. If a company has not adequately researched the size of their market, this can be a real deal-killer. I remember meeting with founders for a new company; while I was originally really excited about the potential for their product, pointed questions during our meeting revealed that the market size was only a few million dollars worldwide. As you can imagine, deducing the size of your market during an investor meeting is probably not the best way to make an impression. Make sure you truly understand your target market, and the key players within it. The identification of key competitors is an important detail to include and can actually play in your favor if you can clearly articulate how you differentiate yourself. In the case of some companies, where distribution channels and key partnerships are important, identifying these and discussing them is important to provide potential investors with confidence that your team understands the challenges inherent to its industry. The company’s ability to analyze its cash needs and expectations for growth. Nothing is scarier than a company whose ambitions are huge, but whose idea of cash management is not in line. As we covered during the milestones section, you don’t need a CFO, but you do need to have thought out what key costs grow with your ambitious growth and when the crucial cash-points are for your company. Generally speaking, investors don’t have financial discussions on the very first meeting, but if you have an understanding of your cash uses, this will make you seem far more competent. The completeness and experience of the company’s team. Suffice it to say that if you have a great team, highlight their accomplishments. If you know you need to hire someone to round out the team, it’s okay to put that down as a future hire—at least the investor will know that you know there is a weak point in the team, and that you plan on solving it as soon as the investment comes in.

What’s worse is when founders just point to the team slide during a pitch, and say something like “Here is our team, we have lots of rockstars”—or something generic like that. Let’s look at what the major selling points of a team slide should be: A team’s capability to deliver. Basically, does your team know anything about what you are doing? If you are a healthcare company, do you have a healthcare background? If you are making something for the financial industry, have any of your team members worked there? Does the team have the right connections across the value chain they operate in to deliver on what they say they will deliver? What companies have your team members worked in that can validate you? If you’ve worked at Google before, for example, it would be worthwhile to put that company logo up on your team slide because the image of the brand would speak faster to your audience than any number of words you could say in the same timeframe. A team’s capacity to deliver. Are you effectively complete or incomplete as a team? Is your team mostly business people but lacking the technical capabilities to deliver, or is your team well rounded and able to execute? If your company industry requires an amazing specialist, do you have that specialist? By the way, do not assume that it is a bad thing to admit you are looking to hire for specific functions you don’t currently have… ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=541))

Now, a couple of tips before moving on to the next section: Avoid putting a valuation on your deck/plan (unless you are finalizing a round). Investors may ask for this figure in person, but you are likely to prevent a future dialogue if you put the valuation on paper and it is either too big or too small for the investor. By omitting it, the investor focuses on what matters: what you are trying to build. The second tip is that a cap table, which we will cover shortly, is a handy thing to include in your plan/deck (but perhaps you won’t have space to include it in a verbal presentation). This is useful mostly for subsequent discussions, but can greatly help the investor to understand everyone’s motivations. I always recommend you build your own cap table, although these days there are plenty of online resources to help you.

The Option Pool As part of creating a cap table, you’ll likely have to create an employee option pool (I’m avoiding the technicalities between the different variants of these, such as Restricted Stock Units, for simplicity’s sake). Unfortunately, the option pool is one of the most complicated parts of your company’s cap table and, from the founder’s point of view, can be very confusing because of how investors expect it to be treated.

This means that investors are expecting a 10 percent option pool after their money has come in. In order to do this, the option pool needs to be calculated before their money—effectively on a pre-money basis. If you want to go deeper into how this is calculated and why, search for the “Option Pool Shuffle”. In summary, the norm is for investors to expect your option pool to come out of the pre-money valuation of your company.

The Cycle of Fundraising The fundraising process is highly iterative. It’s almost impossible to understand what to say and how to say it for maximum positive effect without going through several fail cycles first.

Before going further, let’s take a look at how to stop the cycle of fundraising in its tracks. In other words, what NOT to do when fundraising. Below is the top ten list of fundraising fails. 10. Presenting with a style that doesn’t capture the right attention. Yes, being over the top and dropping f-bombs might get you attention, but is it the right attention? Are you focusing attention on your message, or just yourself? On the other hand, what about a boring slide deck? Or a deck that is missing product shots? Do these represent you well? What if you say your product is simple, but then your deck is really over-complicated. Does that sound right? ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=678))

Not having a proper fundraising plan. Fundraising requires research. Find out if your potential investors are even interested in your sector. Have they invested in your competitor? What amount do they typically invest? Going to someone who is typically a late-stage investor when you are raising a little bit of money is like putting in a minimum order of 10 pizzas when you can only eat one.

Not demonstrating a real pain for your customer (and how your solution fixes it). It is always tempting to create something that is useful to you. Though, is the solution you’ve created really a necessity or just a nice-to-have? Demonstrating a real pain, usually through some form of real customer validation, is crucial to making a convincing argument for your startup. Note that you should avoid asking someone an obvious question where the answer is “yes” but doesn’t validate anything. If you aren’t sure about how to ask the “right” questions to ascertain whether there… ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=688))

Not knowing your cash needs and cash burn. If you’re fundraising and you don’t know how much money you need, how long it will take you to achieve what, and how you will spend the money you receive… well, don’t fault investors if they aren’t impressed with your request for investment. 3. Not explaining why your team is the team that will make this happen. Your team is 99 percent of the reason why your company succeeds, and the idea is probably 1 percent. If you skim through the “why” of why your team is the right one for this investment, you’ll likely miss an opportunity to impress an investor. Later in this book, we’ll cover how an investor reviews your team, which will shed light on what VCs and angels are looking for. 2.

Research the investor and his or her firm. It’s a huge waste of time for you (and them) to reach out to someone who invests in the wrong sector, geography, or stage of your business. Review their website. Read about what they are interested in, professionally and personally. This will make your interaction with the investor far more relevant. Rely on a third party for an introduction. If you can find someone who knows the person you’re trying to reach, a personal introduction will serve you far better than trying to reach the investor in question directly. LinkedIn is a useful tool to find out who within your network knows the person you’d like to get in touch with. This makes the introduction process far more relevant. Keep your initial email short and to the point. Don’t overdo it content-wise and length-wise; you don’t want to have the investor gloss over the sheer mass of your email and relegate it to the “to read” bucket. I’ve seen some well-intended emails that are so comprehensive that they are more off-putting than anything because it poses as a massive cognitive wall to overcome before an investor is even sure they are interested in pursuing further. Think of your initial email as merely a “preview” or elevator pitch with a call to action, such as emailing or calling for more information if they are interested in the idea. Don’t forget to thank the person who introduced you. If you want to, feel free to keep them updated on the conversation, but remove them from the cc of the initial intro email (move them to bcc). You don’t want to overburden their inbox either! ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=735))

Twitter/LinkedIn/Reddit/Clubhouse, etc. are increasingly becoming efficient tools for contacting people for quick things, if used sparingly and in a very specific, non-generic way. You can @reply someone you are interested in to engage in a conversation or comment on what they said as a starter. Avoid sweet-talking though. Get out of the office. Go to events (online or, in the case of a pandemic-free world, in person!) and make new friends! When there, find people to introduce you to others; avoid interrupting ongoing conversations but don’t be afraid to work your way into the conversation if they are open to it and you feel that you can make a valuable contribution.

Invest in Yourself Because building relationships is so crucial to the fundraising process, I have consistently seen good relational skills make a big difference for founders. This is not only the case when fundraising; it is also relevant when finding employees, clients, and partners for their company. The old adage, “It’s not what you know, but who you know”, is very much consistent with what I’ve observed over the years. Keeping in mind that you are the biggest factor in your ability to build relationships, a substantial investment in yourself is needed to fine-tune this essential aspect of fundraising.

The easiest place to start is the self-learning route, with two books I rank very highly in this space: Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi and The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane. These books will help you understand many of the social cues necessary for you to effectively network. They also do a good job explaining the “why” of all things social, which is necessary for you to understand and internalize before going out and practicing your skills. These are must-reads.

Next, if you want to step it up a bit, engaging with a professional coach can help you understand how to overcome some of the challenges you may have that prevent you from networking effectively. These days, having a coach shows strength in that you’re actively investing in developing yourself. A coach doesn’t necessarily set goals for you, but instead helps you understand what steps to take to achieve what you set out to achieve, considering all the variables you may have in play. Coaching works. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=774))

Lastly, the most extreme step is to push the boundaries of your personality with something that takes you out of your comfort zone so that you can see how others see you. One example is to enroll in an improvisational comedy course. I did it and tried out imprology.com here in London.

A key concept that arose during the improvisation course was how to amplify other people’s emotional offers and not reject them at the start. Many times we are too closed in the way we converse. We don’t pay attention to how others are reacting or suggesting, perhaps because we are too busy thinking about what to say next!

First and foremost, do your research. You can do a lot of it online, but there are other things you can do as well: Ask. Yes… it’s that simple. When your first meeting is over and the investor asks if you have any questions, simply ask. “What’s your usual process?” “What are the next steps?” Historical Research—on CrunchBase, AngelList, etc. Find out what they’ve done, who they’ve done it with, and how they’ve done it. Portfolio. Research their portfolio of companies and see if you know any of the CEOs of those companies; if you do, or know someone who does, have a chat with them to understand how the fund works and how their investment decision process works. People. Research the partner and associate you will be talking to. The more you know about them, the better you can tailor your message to their area of investment interest. You also want to get a feel for whether you want to work with them in the first place! Competitor. Find out if they have invested in your competitors. Find out how old their fund is, as older funds will likely be less willing to take very high-risk investments or might be out of cash entirely.

Quick, constructive conflict resolution. Roadblocks are inevitable along the startup journey, and knowing how to cope improves the forecast of your team’s longevity. Knowing when to crack a joke, divide a problem into parts, or take a break can mean the difference between staying together or falling apart. Although I have heard of some investors doing an artificial “stress test” during investment reviews, it isn’t standard practice.

Three ingredients seem to present in the teams we backed. It is not a precise recipe with exact weights and measure every time, but nevertheless three elements were always present: passion for the problem to solve, as measured by the depth of domain knowledge of the team; ambition to take on a large opportunity, even if complex, to build a big business; and a good mix of leadership/management skills, as teams need both to set the direction and execute it with precision and focus. When a startup possesses these three ingredients, raising capital shouldn’t be too hard. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=949))

When an investor is discussing numbers with an entrepreneur, demonstrating a solid understanding of why the numbers are there, a clear view of the market dynamics in which their company operates, realistic customer acquisition assumptions and hiring plans, effective use of marketing budgets, and an understanding of the appropriate expenses for a growing company can have a HUGE impact on establishing the necessary credibility of competence an entrepreneur needs to inspire confidence.

Let me share with you a little secret: with a few exceptions, you will always know your industry and its numbers better than any investor will. However, an experienced investor will ask you the right questions to ascertain whether or not you know your industry well enough to increase the probability of your own company’s success. As such, really do your homework. And by that I mean, don’t just go out and build a product and hope there will be customers. As soon as you have customer validation, make an effort to understand the market dynamics of that customer. How many of them are there? What is their concentration? How do you reach them? Are they locked in with a competitor with some sort of monthly or annual contract? Do they buy in a cyclical pattern? Do they prefer to buy online or only from salespeople? Do they need help setting up your product or can they use it as-is? What are they generally willing to pay for other similar services? How is the market growing? Mind you that in some circumstances, the ability to “charge” customers may not be deemed the real potential for revenues at first (think about Twitter when they were starting). But again, it’s how you articulate the future value that matters. ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=1041))

let’s cover a few basics you should prioritize: Focus on the commercial terms of your round first, and not the structure. Focus on what amount of money you need to build your company and the dilutive impact of taking money this would imply. Focus on anything that will affect your growth and your opportunity for future growth first. Look at your terms comprehensively and what they are trying to achieve. What are the key things that are necessary as part of this round of both you and the investor? This includes items like information rights, board rights, etc. Once you have thought through the above two points, then engage in the conversation about deal structure. Though be careful not to fall into the temptation of going for what is popular. Founders frequently hear that it is en vogue to close deals with a SAFE, convertible, or equity, or whatever; they may have read a blog post with a list of reasons why one is better than the other. For example, in some cases investors may be more incentivized to give you more cash if the deal is done in a specific country or in a specific structure because of tax benefits they may receive (e.g. SEIS in the UK). While in some cases this may make things a little trickier for you, it may be worth it for the additional money. In summary, there are many ways for you and an investor to come to an agreement about structuring to close a round. Don’t be hung up on one type of deal structure. Before entering into discussions about deal details with an investor, decide what you are willing to compromise on in order to receive funds, rather than dogmatically dismissing some options you might be presented with if other deals don’t materialize. With that in mind, don’t get over-complicated or deviate too far from the market norm. Anything that is new or vastly different in terms of deal… ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=1208))

Deal Structures When you do eventually get to talking about deal structures, you’ll be entering into a topic that investors deal with daily, and for most founders only a handful of times in their company’s journey. Deal structures are also always evolving. They can come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from straight-up equity (including ordinary and preferred shares) to convertible notes, warrants, and newer structures such as SAFE/ASAs and “convertible equity”, to name a few.

Deciphering an Equity Term Sheet This may seem obvious to some, but to be on the safe side, I want to clarify that when you’ve received a term sheet for an equity investment, the term sheet is not where the deal ends. Rather, the term sheet merely summarizes the key terms of the deal; more documents will follow before the final deal closes. A typical equity deal can be likened to an iceberg, documentation-wise: the tip is merely the term sheet; the heavy stuff is under the water.

While I won’t go into the legal nitty-gritty of a term sheet, I will quickly summarize the sections so that you familiarize yourself with the basic structure. There are several sections that comprise an average term sheet, but they generally fall into the following buckets: Economics of your deal (valuation, round size, etc.), including your option pool size. Structure of deal, which specifies type of share (preferred or common/ordinary) as well as any kind of tax relief mechanisms for investors (e.g. SEIS/EIS in the UK). Control provisions, which investors will want in order to make sure that they feel involved (which control provisions should be included is a topic of much debate). If you want to see some examples, visit: https://venturebeat.com/2011/03/28/demystifying-the-vc-term-sheet-protective-provisions Treatment of founder’s shares when a founder leaves. This is usually done in the form of “reverse vesting”. In short, it is a mechanism that allows you to fairly preserve your equity when another founder leaves prior to a pre-allotted time. Board and governance structure. There are many variants on the “ideal board”, so I won’t cover the subject here, but typically there is a desire by investors to be involved at the board level in some capacity (again, another topic of debate, particularly on whether early-stage investors should have director seats but, alas, a topic for another day). Generally speaking though, the earlier the stage of the company, the less formality should be expected in the formation of the board, as a board should not burden already time-starved founders with too many meetings and required documentation. Deal fees. Effectively who will pay for what, in terms of the legals for completion. Typically, the smaller the round, the more that each party pays their own legal fees, but as the rounds get bigger and more costly, it’s increasingly more common to have the fees come out of the new fundraising round’s capital. Option pool. Typically, you’ll have a clause that shows how much will be allocated for new employees who will be hired after the round closes. One of the best option pool calculators out there right now was created by Index Ventures. It helps you visualize amounts and allocations and I highly recommend it: https://www.indexventures.com/optionplan/# Exclusivity and legal binding. This is another one of those misunderstood sections. While it is very clear on most term sheets that the document is non-binding (generally the only legally binding part is the exclusivity), it is seen as very bad form to sign a term sheet without the intention of taking the deal once the necessary paperwork (bottom of the iceberg) and due diligence are complete. Naturally, there are always extenuating circumstances, but generally, it is ill-advised to play games with what you sign.

Deciphering Convertible Notes Convertible notes, and their cousins (the SAFE/ASA/convertible equity) are different from an equity round in that they are commercial agreements for a form of future equity transaction.

Total amount raised by the note. This amount does have a natural limit. Think about it this way: you have an amount “outstanding on your cap table” that will be part of an upcoming round. If a new round in the future isn’t particularly big, having too much money outstanding can create a problem with your convertible note holders taking up too large a portion of that round.

Price per share is calculated by taking the company’s pre-money valuation (negotiated at the time of the equity financing between the company and the investors) and dividing that number by the total number of outstanding shares/issued shares in the company (the company’s fully diluted capital) in addition to anything that can turn into a share (e.g. employee options).

The valuation cap is intended to ease investor concerns by placing a maximum pre-money valuation on the company at the time of conversion. With the use of a cap, an investor can effectively set the minimum amount of equity he is willing to own as part of having participated in your convertible note round. For example, if you have a $200,000 note on a valuation that has a $5 million cap, the worst-case scenario for that convertible note holder would be 4 percent equity (0.2 / 5 = 4 percent) after the new round is over. In effect, the further north the valuation cap is from what you expect your pre-money valuation will be for your next round, the less you should care about the cap, as it is less likely to affect you negatively.

One thing to note is a rising prevalence of uncapped notes. Clearly, this is a founder-friendly outcome and, if possible, always nice to get. The flip-side is that an investor may feel a bit “unprotected” should the company do exceedingly well, and their amount thus converts to a much smaller percentage than originally hoped. So if you as the founder suggest it, you may not receive it. ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=1349))

The interest rate on a note. A convertible note is a form of debt, or loan. As such, it usually accumulates interest, typically 4-8 percent between the point when you sign it and when it converts. These days, this amount is usually converted as part of the overall amount at the next round. For example, if you have an annual interest rate of 8 percent and you have a loan note of $100, then you’d convert $108 after a year. This term is still seen on some convertible notes but is increasingly less common. Note: in the US, it’s highly advisable to include an interest rate, even if it’s simply a nominal amount equal to the applicable federal rate (most recently at less than 1 percent). If you don’t include an interest rate, any amount that could have been earned… ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=1352))

Conversion triggers. The point of a convertible note is for it to convert at some point in the future, not for it to stay outstanding indefinitely. As such, the note will likely specify a series of triggers for conversion. One I mentioned earlier is the next “qualified round”. Basically, this means that the round is both big enough to accommodate the amount in the note (without preventing the new investors from reaching their ownership target), and that it will give the note holders the types of rights they’d expect for their shares once converted from loan to equity. Tom McGinn adds: “Another reason why investors may want a Qualified Round concept is just to ensure that the note converts as part of… ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=1359))

Another conversion trigger is an expiration maturity date, whereby the note holder typically can either ask for their money back (although this rarely happens) or basically seek to convert the outstanding amount at that point. Upon a change-of-control event in the future, and before the convertible is converted, investors can sometimes ask for a multiple of their loan back as payment in lieu of converting to ordinary shares prior to the completion of the… ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012CZT24U&location=1365))
