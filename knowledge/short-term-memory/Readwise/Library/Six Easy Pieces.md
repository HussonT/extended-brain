Chemists have studied these arrangements of the atoms, and found that every substance is some type of arrangement of atoms. (Location 690)

How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work.

A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened, of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square).

The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. (Location 809)

The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to amalgamate everything, and merely discover that this world represents different aspects of one thing? (Location 829)

We then have two rules: (a) charges make a field, and (b) charges in fields have forces on them and move. The reason for this will become clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we were to charge a body, (Location 903)
