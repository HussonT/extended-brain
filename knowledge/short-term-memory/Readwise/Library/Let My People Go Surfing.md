Looking back now, I see that we made all the classic mistakes of a growing company. We failed to provide the proper training for the new company leaders, and the strain of managing a company with eight autonomous product divisions and three channels of distribution exceeded management’s skills. We never developed the mechanisms to encourage them to work together in ways that kept the overall business objectives in sight. (Location 820)

Never exceed your limits. You push the envelope, and you live for those moments when you’re right on the edge, but you don’t go over. You have to be true to yourself; you have to know your strengths and limitations and live within your means. The same is true for a business. The sooner a company tries to be what it is not, the sooner it tries to “have it all,” the sooner it will die. (Location 920)

This is good for the owner, the user. But this is good as well as part of a greater whole: increased durability means that we take less (decreased consumption of material and energy), that we need to produce less (gives us more time to do other things we think are important or enjoyable), destroy less (less waste).

Is It Durable? This question also derives from our origins in climbing gear, which has to stand up to hard, prolonged use, and has become a factor in our environmental philosophy as well. Because the overall durability of a product is only as good as its weakest element, the ultimate goal should be a product whose parts wear out at roughly the same time and only after a long life.

To get all the components of a Patagonia product to be roughly equal in durability, we test continually in both the lab and the field. We test until something fails, strengthen that part, then see what fails next, strengthen that, etc., until we’re confident that the product is durable as a whole. (Location 1120)

Is the Product Line Simple? Some choices are simple: Do you want your goat cheese plain or with chives? But most choices for consumers aren’t that simple.

You can minimize risk by doing your research and, most of all, by testing. Testing is an integral part of the Patagonia industrial design process, and it needs to be included in every part of this process. It involves testing competitors’ products, “quick and dirty” testing of new ideas to see if they are worth pursuing, fabric testing, “living” with a new product to judge how “hot” the sales may be, testing production samples for function and durability, etc., and test (Location 1349)
