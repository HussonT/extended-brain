Is There a Better Way? Running Lean provides a better, faster way to vet new product ideas and build successful products: Running Lean is about speed, learning, and focus. Running Lean is about testing a vision by measuring how customers behave. Running Lean is about engaging customers throughout the product development cycle. Running Lean tackles both product and market validation in parallel using short iterations. Running Lean is a disciplined and rigorous process. (Location 210)

Running Lean references an array of methodologies and thinkers. Three of the most important follow. Customer Development Customer Development is a term coined by Steve Blank and is used to describe the parallel process of building a continuous feedback loop with customers throughout the product development cycle. It is defined in his book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany. The key takeaway from Customer Development can best be summed up as: Get out of the building. (Location 218)

Lean Startup Lean Startup is a term trademarked by Eric Ries and represents a synthesis of Customer Development, Agile Software Development methodologies, and Lean (as in the Toyota Production System) practices. The term Lean is often misunderstood as “being cheap.” While “being Lean” is fundamentally about eliminating waste or being efficient with resources, that interpretation is not completely misguided because money happens to be one of those resources.

The key takeaway from Lean Startup can best be summed up around the concept of using smaller, faster iterations for testing a vision. Startups that succeed are those that manage to iterate enough times before running out of resources. (Location 230)

Bootstrapping Bootstrapping is more commonly understood as a collection of techniques used to minimize the amount of external debt or funding needed from banks or investors. To often, people confuse bootstrapping with self-funding. A stricter definition is funding with customer revenues. However, I subscribe to a much more philosophical definition of bootstrapping put forward by Bijoy Goswami: (Location 233)

All men dream: but not equally. Those that dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible. —T.E.

Capture Your Business Model Hypotheses Too many founders carry their hypotheses in their heads alone, which, though the fastest way to iterate, only helps to further support their own “reality distortion fields.” (Location 345)

Additionally, since most Plan As are likely to be proven wrong anyway, you need something less static and rigid than a business plan. Taking several weeks or months to write a 60-page business plan largely built on untested hypotheses is a form of waste. Waste is any human activity which absorbs resources but creates no value. —James P. Womak and Daniel T. Jones, Lean Thinking (Free Press) (Location 350)

My format of choice is to use the one-page business model diagram (Lean Canvas) shown in Figure 1-1. Figure 1-1. Lean Canvas Lean Canvas is my adaptation of Alex Osterwalder’s Business Model Canvas, which he describes in the book Business Model Generation (Wiley).[4] I particularly like the one-page canvas format because it is: Fast Compared to writing a business plan, which can take several weeks or months, you can outline multiple business models on a canvas in one afternoon. Because creating these one-page business models takes so little time, I recommend spending a little additional time up front, brainstorming possible variations to your model and then prioritizing where to start. Concise The canvas forces you to pick your words carefully and get to the point. This is great practice for distilling the essence of your product. You have 30 seconds to grab the attention of an investor over a hypothetical elevator ride, and eight seconds to grab the attention of a customer on your landing page.[5] Portable A single-page business model is much easier to share with others, which means it will be read by more people and probably will be more frequently updated.

Stage 1: Problem/Solution Fit Key question: Do I have a problem worth solving? The first stage is about determining whether you have a problem worth solving before investing months or years of effort into building a solution. While ideas are cheap, acting on them is quite expensive. A problem worth solving boils down to three questions: Is it something customers want? (must-have) Will they pay for it? If not, who will? (viable) Can it be solved? (feasible) (Location 409)

In Part IV of this book, we’ll cover both qualitative and quantitative metrics for measuring product/market fit. Achieving traction or product/market fit is the first significant milestone for a startup. At this stage, you have a plan that is starting to work—you are signing up customers, retaining them, and getting paid. (Location 420)

Stage 3: Scale Key question: How do I accelerate growth? After product/market fit, some level of success is almost always guaranteed. Your focus at this stage shifts toward growth, or scaling your business model. Pivot Before Product/Market Fit, Optimize After Achieving product/market fit is the first significant milestone of a startup and greatly influences both strategy and tactics. For this reason, it is helpful to further delineate the stages of a startup as “before product/market fit” and “after product/market fit.” (Location 426)

Step 3: Systematically Test Your Plan With your Plan A documented and your starting risks prioritized, you are now ready to systematically test your plan. In a Lean Startup, this is done by running a series of experiments. The Lean Startup methodology is strongly rooted in the scientific method, and running experiments is a key activity. We’ll cover steps for running effective experiments in Part III of the book, but for now, let’s start by defining an experiment. What Is an Experiment? A cycle around the validated learning loop shown in Figure 1-6 is called an experiment. (Location 468)

We know that startups are highly uncertain, but uncertainty and risk aren’t the same thing. We can be uncertain about a lot of things that aren’t risky. Douglas Hubbard makes a clear distinction between the two in his book, How to Measure Anything (Wiley): Uncertainty: The lack of compete certainty, that is, the existence of more than one possibility. Risk: A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve a loss, catastrophe, or other undesirable outcome. (Location 945)

You need people on your team that can deliver on the right experience that matches your customers’ worldview. (Location 1078)

Be Wary of Outsourcing Your Problem/Solution Team I constantly run across teams that try to outsource one or more of these three areas, which is usually a bad idea. While you might be able to outsource an early prototype or demo, be wary of putting yourself at the mercy of someone else’s schedule, as that can limit your ability to both iterate quickly and learn. The one thing you should never outsource is learning about customers. (Location 1084)

Maximize for Speed, Learning, and Focus Because the goal of a startup is to find a plan that works before running out of resources, we know that speed, as measured by cycle time around the Build-Measure-Learn loop shown in Figure 5-1, is important. We also know that learning—specifically, learning about customers—is important. But something that doesn’t get nearly enough attention is focus. You need all three—speed, learning, and focus—to run an optimal experiment. Let’s see what happens when you don’t have all three (see Figure 5-2). (Location 1090)

Speed and focus When you are going fast and are focused but not learning, the image of a dog chasing its tail comes to mind. You are expending a lot of energy but simply going around in circles. Learning and focus When you are focused on the right thing and learning but you are not moving quickly enough, you stand the danger of running out of resources or getting outpaced by a competitor. Speed and learning Finally, when you are going fast and learning but you are not focused, you can fall into the premature optimization trap. Some examples of premature optimization are scaling servers when you have no customers, and optimizing landing pages when you don’t yet have a product that works. (Location 1100)

Create Accessible Dashboards Testing hypotheses can be scary for founders. This is understandable, as startup founders pour their blood, sweat, and tears into their work. They have a lot riding on the outcome of their efforts and don’t like to be proven wrong. But without a level of transparency and objectivity, there is a danger of running your startup primarily on faith. It is imperative to openly share your experiments company-wide. (Location 1168)

Communicate Learning Early and Often Company-wide dashboards are great for on-the-ground tactical analysis, but it is equally important to report on your learning milestones at a strategic level. A good way to do this is to periodically communicate the lessons learned from your last batch of experiments—weekly with your internal team and at least monthly with your external advisors and investors. This lets you pause, reflect on your findings as a team, and better plan the next set of activities (i.e., hypotheses to test). (Location 1175)

You can’t afford to blindly follow a process (even this one) or aimlessly run experiments just for the sake of learning. Instead, you need to start with the end in mind and carefully align your experiments into “staged iterations” so that your learning is additive. Maximize learning (about what’s riskiest) per unit time. (Location 1199)

While the top three starting risks serve as a quick diagnostic for prioritizing your canvases, here is how you systematically tackle them in stages (see Figure 5-4): Stage 1: Understand the problem Conduct formal customer interviews or use other customer observational techniques to understand whether you have a problem worth solving. Who has the problem, what is the top problem, and how is it solved today? Stage 2: Define the solution Armed with knowledge from Stage 1, take a stab at defining the solution, build a demo that helps the customer visualize the solution, and then test it with customers. Will the solution work? Who is the early adopter? Does the pricing model work? Stage 3: Validate qualitatively Build your MVP and then soft-launch it to your early adopters. Do they realize the unique value proposition (UVP)? How will you find enough early adopters to support learning? Are you getting paid? Stage 4: Verify quantitatively Launch your refined product to a larger audience. Have you built something people want? How will you reach customers at scale? Do you have a viable business?

Here is how you view them based on risks: Product risk: Getting the product right First make sure you have a problem worth solving. Then define the smallest possible solution (MVP). Build and validate your MVP at small scale (demonstrate UVP). Then verify it at large scale. Customer risk: Building a path to customers First identify who has the pain. Then narrow this down to early adopters who really want your product now. It’s OK to start with outbound channels. But gradually build/develop scalable inbound channels—the earlier the better. Market risk: Building a viable business Identify competition through existing alternatives and pick a price for your solution. Test pricing first by measuring what customers say (verbal commitments). Then test pricing by what customers do. Optimize your cost structure to make the business model work. (Location 1218)

Build a frame around learning, not pitching. In a pitch, since you’re doing most of the talking, it’s very easy for customers to pretend to go along with what you’re saying, or to outright lie to you. The problem with starting with a pitch is that it is predicated on having knowledge about the “right” product for the customer (Problem/Solution Fit). (Location 1278)

Welcome (Set the Stage) (2 minutes) As before, you need to briefly set the stage for how the interview works: Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us today. We are currently working on a photo and video sharing service designed for parents. I got the idea after becoming a parent and experiencing some frustrations firsthand with existing solutions. The interview will work like this. I’ll start by describing the main problems we are tackling and then I’ll ask whether any of those resonate with you. I also would like to show you an early demo of the application. I’d like to stress that we don’t have a finished product yet, and our objective is to learn from you, not to sell or pitch anything to you. Does that sound good? Collect Demographics (Test Customer Segment) (2 minutes) Ask some introductory questions to collect basic demographics that you believe will drive how you segment and qualify your early adopters. If you’ve already interviewed this prospect, you can skip this section unless there are additional questions you’ve uncovered since you last interviewed him. Before we go on to the problems, I’d like to learn a little about you: How many kids do you have? How old are they? Do you share photos online? Do you share videos online? How often? With whom? Tell a Story (Set Problem Context) (2 minutes) As before, illustrate the top three problems with a story: Great, thanks. So, let me tell you about the problems we are tackling. Once we had kids, we found ourselves taking a lot more photos than before, and especially more videos. We also started getting regular requests (as in, weekly) for updates from grandparents and other family members. But we found it difficult to share all this content on a regular basis because the process was too time-consuming and sometimes painful. We had to organize the files, resize them, and babysit the upload process. Video was even more painful because we often had to convert the video first (transcode) into a web-friendly format. Like most other parents, we are sleep-deprived and don’t have as much free time as before. Having kids has given us a whole new appreciation for free time, and we’d much rather spend our time doing other things. Does any of this resonate with you? If you don’t sense a strong problem resonance, don’t continue with the Solution interview, but rather use the Problem interview script to learn more about how the prospects solve these problems today. Demo (Test Solution) (15 minutes) This is the heart of the interview. Go through each problem in turn and illustrate how you solve it using the supporting demo. <For each problem> Illustrate how you solve the problem using the supporting demo. Pause after each one and ask if they have any questions. <Repeat for other problems> So, that’s what the application looks like right now. We are trying to prioritize what to finish and release first and would like to ask you a few more questions: What part of the demo resonated with you the most? Which could you live without? Are there any additional features you think are missing? Test Pricing (Revenue Streams) (3 minutes) Finding the right price is more art than science. Usually the right price is one the customer accepts, but with a little resistance. Test pricing using the “starting price” you determined earlier for this customer segment. Don’t ask the customer for ballpark pricing. Instead, tell him your pricing model (with or without anchoring) and gauge his response immediately afterward. If he accepts the pricing, make a note of whether he hesitated or readily accepted. So, let’s talk about pricing next. We will launch the service using a subscription model. Would you pay $49 a year for unlimited photo and video sharing? Wrapping Up (the Ask) (2 minutes) We are done with all the hypothesis questions, but you still have two more questions to ask. The first is permission to follow up with them to test the service when it’s ready. If possible, try to secure a more concrete commitment than just a verbal one. The second is to ask for referrals to other people you could potentially interview. Thanks a lot for your time today. You have been very helpful. As I mentioned at the start, this isn’t a finished product, but we are close to launching something soon. Would you be interested in trying out the product when we have something ready? Also, we are looking to interview more people like yourself. Do you know any other parents of young kids who we could interview? Document Results (5 minutes) Take the five minutes immediately following an interview to document your results while they’re still fresh in your mind. It helps to create a template like the one that follows so that you can quickly jot down the responses to the hypotheses you set out to test. As before, have each interviewer independently fill out the form first. Then have a debriefing session later where you compare notes and make a final entry into whatever system you use to record your interview results. (Location 1830)

The Need for Actionable Metrics Even though the terrain before product/market fit is riddled with qualitative learning, you still need actionable metrics to be able to visualize and measure your customer lifecycle.

It’s not what you measure, but how. Understanding the difference between a vanity metric and a macro metric is the first step. In order to make your metrics actionable, you have to additionally make them accessible (through simple reports) and auditable (by being able to go behind the numbers). The three A’s of metrics are: Actionable, Accessible, and Auditable. (Location 2145)

The ideal conversion dashboard is part analytics and part customer relationship management. Here’s why: Metrics can’t explain themselves. When you first launch a product or new feature, lots of things can and do go wrong. Metrics can help you identify where things are going wrong, but they can’t tell you why. You need to talk to people for that. (Location 2154)

Not all metrics are equal. You’ve been very selective about who you’ve interviewed up until now. Once you launch, you won’t be able to control who uses your product. In addition to your target early adopters, you might be visited by bots, curious onlookers, and maybe even other undiscovered target customers. (Location 2162)

Simple Funnel Reports Aren’t Enough The funnel report is a powerful analysis tool. It’s simple to understand and lends itself well to visually depicting a conversion dashboard. But most third-party implementations of funnel reports are better suited at tracking micro-level funnels, like landing page conversions, than macro-level funnels, like your customer lifecycle.

Inaccurate conversion rates The numbers reported for the revenue event most likely include purchases made in May and exclude purchases made in July, which skews the overall conversion rates. Dealing with traffic fluctuations This skewing of numbers is further exacerbated by any fluctuations in traffic. If signups go down in July, your conversion rates will appear to be better when they may not be. Measuring progress (or not) Another problem with this sort of reporting is that your product is also constantly changing. It is hard, if not outright impossible, to tie back observed results (good or bad) to actions you took in the past, such as launching a new feature. Segmenting funnels Over time, you will probably run a split test or need to segment your funnel to isolate one group of customers from another. You can’t do this with a simple funnel report.

Say Hello to the Cohort So, while funnels are a great visualization tool, funnels alone are not enough. The answer is to couple funnels with cohorts. (Location 2188)

Chapter 11. The MVP Interview Before selling your minimum viable product (MVP) to strangers through your distribution channel (e.g., marketing website), sell it face to face to friendly early adopters. Learn from them. Then refine your design, positioning, and pricing for launch. (Location 2222)

If you can’t convert a warm prospect in a 20-minute face-to-face interview, it will be much harder to convert a visitor in less than eight seconds on your landing page. (Location 2227)

During the MVP interview, you are specifically looking to answer the following questions: Product risk: What is compelling about the product? (Unique Value Proposition or UVP) Does your landing page get noticed? Do customers make it all the way through your activation flow? What are the usability hot spots? Does your MVP demonstrate and deliver on your UVP? Customer risk: Do you have enough customers? (Channels) Can you bring on more customers using your existing channels? Market risk: Is the price right? (Revenue Streams) Do customers pay for your solution? (Location 2229)

to agree to an interview is to “nail his problem.” One of the best exercises for crafting such a message involves spending an afternoon writing a shorter version of a long-form sales letter—no matter what type of business you’re building. (Location 3233)

How to Write a Sales Letter While there’s more that goes into a complete sales letter, I recommend starting with just your unique value proposition (UVP), problem, and solution. All you need for this exercise is a text editor. You can use different fonts, but avoid graphics at this stage and just focus on the copy. (Location 3237)
