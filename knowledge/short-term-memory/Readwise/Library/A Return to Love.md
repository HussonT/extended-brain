Fear unchecked grows exponentially. Love poured forth has the power to remove it. Thus is the power of God in our lives. If A Return to Love makes one iota of difference in anyone’s ability to experience that power, then I am exceedingly glad I wrote it. I wish you miracles. I wish you love. (Location 81)

These changes in life are always going to happen; they’re part of the human experience. What we can change, however, is how we perceive them. And that shift in our perception is a miracle. (Location 303)

Freud defined neurosis as separation from self, and so it is. Our real self is the love within us. It’s the “child of God.” The fearful self is an impostor. The return to love is the great cosmic drama, the personal journey from pretense to self, from pain to inner peace. (Location 380)

To remember that you are part of God, that you are loved and lovable, is not arrogant. It’s humble. To think you are anything else is arrogant, because it implies you’re something other than a creation of God. (Location 406)

Since every thought creates experience, there’s no worse place it could possibly be. While it’s true there isn’t an actual devil out there grabbing for our souls, there is a tendency in our minds, which can be amazingly strong, to perceive without love. (Location 456)

Thought separated from love is a profound miscreation. It’s our own power turned against ourselves. The moment the mind first deviated from love—when ‘the Son of God forgot to laugh’—an entire illusionary world came into being. A Course in Miracles calls this moment our “detour into fear,” or “separation from God.” (Location 466)

So God isn’t angry at our sins because they’re not really happening. He doesn’t see sins, but only errors in perception. He doesn’t want to punish us, but to heal us. The way He heals us is through a force of conciousness called the Holy Spirit. (Location 488)

correction of our perception is called the Atonement. He reminds us that, in every situation, the love you’ve given is real, and the love you have received is real. Nothing else exists. Anything other than love is an illusion. In order to escape the illusion and find inner peace, remember that only love in a situation is real. Everything else is a mistake and does not exist. It must be forgotten. We must consciously be willing to let it go. (Location 500)

Faith isn’t blind, it’s visionary. Faith is believing that the universe is on our side, and that the universe knows what it’s doing. Faith is a psychological awareness of an unfolding force for good, constantly at work in all dimensions. Our attempts to direct this force only interferes with it. Our willingness to relax into it allows it to work on our behalf. Without faith, we’re frantically trying to control what it is not our business to control, and fix what it is not in our power to fix. What we’re trying to control is much better off without us, and what we’re trying to fix can’t be fixed by us anyway. Without faith, we’re wasting time. (Location 611)

If you have a pile of iron shavings and you want to arrange them in beautiful patterns, you can do one of two things. You can use your fingers and try to arrange the tiny pieces of iron into beautiful, gossamer lines—or you can buy a magnet. The magnet will attract the iron shavings. It symbolizes our feminine consciounessness, which exerts its power through attraction rather than activity. (Location 644)

This attractive, receptive, feminine aspect of our consciousness is the space of mental surrender. In Taoist philosophy, “yin” is the feminine principle, representing the forces of the earth, while “yang” is the masculine principle, representing spirit. When God is referred to as “He,” then all mankind becomes “She.” This isn’t a man-woman issue. Reference to God as masculine principle in no way impinges on feminist conviction. Our feminine self is just as important as our masculine. (Location 647)

In Zen Buddhism, there’s a concept called “zen mind,” or “beginner’s mind.” They say that the mind should be like an empty rice bowl. If it’s already full, then the universe can’t fill it. If it’s empty, it has room to receive. This means that when we think we have things already figured out, we’re not teachable. (Location 689)

‘Miracles themselves are not to be consciously directed.’ They occur as involuntary effects of a loving personality, an invisible force that emanates from someone whose conscious intention is to give and receive love.

Our job as a teacher of God, should we choose to accept it, is to constantly seek a greater capacity for love and forgiveness within ourselves. We do this through a “selective remembering,” a conscious decision to remember only loving thoughts and let go of any fearful ones. This is the meaning of forgiveness. (Location 769)

Forgiveness is a full time job, and sometimes very difficult. Few of us always succeed, yet making the effort is our most noble calling. It is the world’s only real chance to begin again. A radical forgiveness is a complete letting go of the past, in any personal relationship, as well as in any collective drama. (Location 783)

All that is real in our past is the love we gave and the love we received. Everything else is an illusion. The past is merely a thought we have. It is literally all in our minds. The Course teaches, “Give the past to Him Who can change your mind about it for you.” To surrender the past to the Holy Spirit is to ask that only loving, helpful thoughts about it remain in our minds, and all the rest be let go.

Finally, glancing across St. Mark’s Square in Venice, I looked closely at my mother and said to myself, “It’s true—God’s not looking at her and thinking, ‘Sophie Ann is such a bitch.’” As long as I chose to see her that way, as long as I was not willing to give up my focus on her errors, I could not be at peace because I was not sharing God’s perception. As soon as I saw this, I released my tense fixation on what I perceived to be her guilt. From that point forward, the situation began to shift. Miraculously, she was nicer to me, and I was nicer to her. (Location 989)

Pain doesn’t stem from the love we’re denied by others, but rather from the love that we deny them. In a case like that, it feels as though we’re hurt by what someone else did. But what really has occurred is that someone else’s closed heart has tempted us to close our own, and it is our own denial of love that hurts us. That’s why the miracle is a shift in our own thinking: the willingness to keep our own heart open, regardless of what’s going on outside us. (Location 1081)

The Course says that there are ‘three levels of teaching’ in relationship. The first level is what we think of as a casual encounter, such as two strangers meeting in an elevator or students who “happen” to walk home from school together. The second level is a “more sustained relationship, in which, for a time, two people enter into a fairly intense teaching-learning situation and then appear to separate.” The third level of teaching is a relationship which, once formed, lasts all our lives. At this level, “each person is given a chosen learning partner who presents him with unlimited opportunities for learning.” (Location 1123)

THE HOLY RELATIONSHIP “The holy relationship is the old unholy relationship transformed and seen anew.” (Location 1200)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/transformation #domain/psychology #insight/definition
  
Course in Miracles describes the difference between an unholy and a holy alliance: “For an unholy relationship is based on differences, where each one thinks the other has what he has not. They come together, each to complete himself and rob the other. They stay until they think that there is nothing left to steal, and then move on. And so they wander through a world of strangers, unlike themselves, living with their bodies perhaps under a common roof that shelters neither; in the same room and yet a world apart. A holy relationship starts from a different premise. Each one has looked within and seen no lack. Accepting his completion, he would extend it by joining with another, whole as himself.” (Location 1204)

All we want by way of a frame is a light support that does just enough to keep the picture in place. We’re not interested in our brother for what he can do for us. We’re interested in our brother, period. (Location 1221)

“Dear God, you know, and I know, that I have more potential for neurosis in this area than in any other. Please take my attraction, my thoughts and feelings about this person and use them for your purposes. Let this relationship unfold according to your will, Amen.” (Location 1231)

The problem is, we haven’t known how to take the greatest advantage of the opportunities we’ve had. Sometimes we didn’t recognize at the time how wonderful those people were. Love is all around us. The ego is the block to our awareness of love’s presence. The idea that there is a perfect person who just hasn’t arrived yet is a major block. (Location 1301)

The most enlightened prayer isn’t “Dear God, send me someone wonderful,” but, “Dear God, help me realize that I am someone wonderful.” Years ago I would pray for a wonderful man to come and take my desperation away. Ultimately I said to myself, “Why don’t you try to deal with that before he gets here?” (Location 1317)

There are people who manifest the potential for sparkle that we all share, and those who don’t. Those who do are usually people who somewhere along the line, either from parents or lovers, were told verbally or nonverbally, “You’re wonderful and beautiful.” Love is to people what water is to plants.
