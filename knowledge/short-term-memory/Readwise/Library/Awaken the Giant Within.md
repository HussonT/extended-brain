My answer is simple: I learned to harness the principle I now call concentration of power. Most people have no idea of the giant capacity we can immediately command when we focus all of our resources on mastering a single area of our lives. Controlled focus is like a laser beam that can cut through anything that seems to be stopping you. (Location 332)

One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular. In fact, I believe most people fail in life (Location 335)

My entire life has been continually driven by a singular, compelling focus: What makes the difference in the quality of people’s lives? How is it that so often people from such humble beginnings and devastating backgrounds manage in spite of it all to create lives that inspire us? Conversely, why do many of those born into privileged environments, with every resource for success at their fingertips, end up fat, frustrated, and often chemically addicted? (Location 339)

I decided many years ago that the most important way I could spend my life would be to invest it in something that would outlast it. I decided that somehow I must contribute in some way that would live on long after I was gone. (Location 351)

STEP ONE Raise Your Standards Any time you sincerely want to make a change, the first thing you must do is to raise your standards. When people ask me what really changed my life eight years ago, I tell them that absolutely the most important thing was changing what I demanded of myself. (Location 385)

STEP ONE Raise Your Standards Any time you sincerely want to make a change, the first thing you must do is to raise your standards. When people ask me what really changed my life eight years ago, I tell them that absolutely the most important thing was changing what I demanded of myself. I wrote down all the things I would no longer accept in my life, all the things I would no longer tolerate, and all the things that I aspired to becoming. (Location 385)

STEP TWO Change Your Limiting Beliefs If you raise your standards but don’t really believe you can meet them, you’ve already sabotaged yourself. You won’t even try; you’ll be lacking that sense of certainty that allows you to tap the deepest capacity that’s within you even as you read this. (Location 393)

How much do you think Gandhi would have accomplished had he not believed with every fiber of his being in the power of nonviolent opposition?

One of my core beliefs is that if you set a higher standard, and you can get yourself to believe, then you certainly can figure out the strategies. You simply will find a way. Ultimately, that’s what this whole book is about. It shows you strategies for getting the job done, and I’ll tell you now that the best strategy in almost any case is to find a role-model, someone who’s already getting the results you want, and then tap into their knowledge.

Virtually everything we do is to change the way we feel—yet most of us have little or no training in how to do this quickly and effectively. It’s amazing how often we use the intelligence at our command to work ourselves into unresourceful emotional states, forgetting about the multitude of innate talents each of us already possesses.

The purpose of this book is not just to help you make a singular change in your life, but rather to be a pivot point that can assist you in taking your entire life to a new level. The focus of this book is on creating global changes. What do I mean by this? Well, you can learn to make changes in your life—overcome a fear or a phobia, increase the quality of a relationship, or overcome your pattern of procrastinating. All these are incredibly valuable skills, and if you’ve read Unlimited Power, you’ve already learned many of them. However, as you continue through the following pages, you’ll find that there are key leverage points within your life that, if you make one small change, will literally transform every aspect of your life.

In this book you will learn a series of simple and specific strategies for addressing the cause of any challenge and changing it with the least amount of effort. For example, it might be hard for you to believe that merely by changing one word that is part of your habitual vocabulary, you could immediately change your emotional patterns for life. Or that by changing the consistent questions that you consciously or unconsciously ask yourself, you could instantly change what you focus on and therefore what actions you take every day of your life.

The difference in the results that people produce comes down to what they’ve done differently from others in the same situations. Different actions produce different results. Why? Because any action is a cause set in motion, and its effect builds on past effects to move us in a definite direction. Every direction leads to an ultimate destination: our destiny. (Location 548)

I’m here to tell you that it’s not important initially to know how you’re going to create a result. What’s important is to decide you will find a way, no matter what. In Unlimited Power, I outlined what I call “The Ultimate Success Formula,” which is an elementary process for getting you where you want to go: 1) Decide what you want, 2) Take action, 3) Notice what’s working or not, and 4) Change your approach until you achieve what you want.

So how do we strengthen these muscles? Give them a workout! The way to make better decisions is to make more of them. Then make sure you learn from each one, including those that don’t seem to work out in the short term: they will provide valuable distinctions to make better evaluations and therefore decisions in the future. Realize that decision making, like any skill you focus on improving, gets better the more often you do it. (Location 689)

The truth of the matter is that there’s nothing you can’t accomplish if: 1) You clearly decide what it is that you’re absolutely committed to achieving, 2) You are willing to take massive action, 3) You notice what’s working or not, and 4) You continue to change your approach until you achieve what you want, using whatever life gives you along the way.

In order to succeed, you must have a long-term focus. Most of the challenges that we have in our personal lives—like indulging constantly in overeating, drinking, or smoking, to feeling overwhelmed and giving up on our dreams—come from a short-term focus. (Location 844)

Remember the true power of making decisions. It’s a tool you can use in any moment to change your entire life. The minute you make a new decision, you set in motion a new cause, effect, direction, and destination for your life. You literally begin to change your life the moment you make a new decision. Remember that when you start feeling overwhelmed, or when you feel like you don’t have a choice, or when things are happening “to” you, you can change it all if you just stop and decide to do so. Remember, a real decision is measured by the fact that you’ve taken new action. If there’s no action, you haven’t truly decided. (Location 892)

Realize that the hardest step in achieving anything is making a true commitment—a true decision. Carrying out your commitment is often much easier than the decision itself, so make your decisions intelligently, but make them quickly. Don’t labor forever over the question of how or if you can do it. Studies have shown that the most successful people make decisions rapidly because they are clear on their values and what they really want for their lives. The same studies show that they are slow to change their decisions, if at all. On the other hand, people who fail usually make decisions slowly and change their minds quickly, always bouncing back and forth. Just decide! Realize that decision making is a kind of act in itself, so a good definition for a decision might be “information acted upon.” You know you’ve truly made a decision when action flows from it. It becomes a cause set in motion. Often the effect of making a decision helps create the attainment of a larger goal. A critical rule I’ve made for myself is never to leave the scene of a decision without first taking a specific action toward its realization. (Location 897)

Learn from your decisions. There’s no way around it. At times, you’re going to screw up, no matter what you do. And when the inevitable happens, instead of beating yourself into the ground, learn something. Ask yourself, “What’s good about this? What can I learn from this?” This “failure” may be an unbelievable gift in disguise if you use it to make better decisions in the future. Rather than focus on the short-term setback, choose instead to learn lessons that can save you time, money, or pain, and that will give you the ability to succeed in the future. (Location 908)

Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach. Once you’ve decided who you want to be as a person, for example, don’t get stuck on the means to achieving it. It’s the end you’re after. Too often, in deciding what they want for their lives, people pick the best way they know at the time—they make a map—but then don’t stay open to alternate routes. Don’t become rigid in your approach. Cultivate the art of flexibility. (Location 913)

Though we’d like to deny it, the fact remains that what drives our behavior is instinctive reaction to pain and pleasure, not intellectual calculation.

Whenever something happens in your life, your brain asks two questions: 1) Will this mean pain or pleasure? 2) What must I do now to avoid pain and/or gain pleasure?

Simply, your experience of doors has provided enough references to create a sense of certainty that allows you to follow through.

Because I overeat, my whole life is destroyed.” Conversely, those who are pessimistic—those who have learned helplessness—have developed a belief that because they screwed up in one area, they are a screw-up!

The most effective way is to get your brain to associate massive pain to the old belief. You must feel deep in your gut that not only has this belief cost you pain in the past, but it’s costing you in the present and, ultimately, can only bring you pain in the future. Then you must associate tremendous pleasure to the idea of adopting a new, empowering belief. (Location 1636)

So how can you create a conviction? 1) Start with the basic belief. 2) Reinforce your belief by adding new and more powerful references. For example, let’s say you’ve decided never to eat meat again. To strengthen your resolve, talk to people who’ve chosen a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle: what reasons prompted them to change their diet, and what have been the consequences on their health and in other areas of their lives? In addition, begin to study the physiological impact that animal protein has. The more references you develop, and the more emotional the references are, the stronger your conviction will become. 3) Then find a triggering event, or else create one of your own. Associate yourself fully by asking, “What will it cost me if I don’t?” Ask questions that create emotional intensity for you. For example, if you want to develop a conviction never to abuse drugs, make the painful consequences of drug abuse feel real to you by viewing films or, better yet, visiting a shelter to see firsthand the devastation wrought by drug abuse. If you’ve vowed to give up smoking, visit the intensive-care wing of a hospital to observe emphysema patients confined to oxygen tents, or view an X-ray of a smoker’s black lungs. These kinds of experiences have the power to push you over the edge and establish true conviction. 4) Finally, take action. Each action you take strengthens your commitment and raises the level of your emotional intensity and conviction. (Location 1729)

But I passionately argued that all changes are created in a moment. It’s just that most of us wait until certain things happen before we finally decide to make a shift. If we truly understood how the brain worked, I argued, we could stop the endless process of analyzing why things had happened to us, and if we could just simply change what we linked pain and pleasure to, we could just as easily change the way our nervous systems had been conditioned and take charge of our lives immediately.

Because the three criteria for forming neuro-associations are so imprecise, it is very easy to fall prey to misinterpretations and create what I call false neuro-associations.

A SOURCE OF SELF-SABOTAGE Even more insidious are mixed neuro-associations, the classic source of self-sabotage. If you’ve ever found yourself starting to accomplish something, and then destroying it, mixed neuro-associations are usually the culprit. (Location 2330)

When you give your brain mixed messages, you’re going to get mixed results. Think of your brain’s decision-making process as being like a scale: “If I were to do this, would it mean pain or pleasure?” And remember, it’s not just the number of factors on each side but the weight they individually carry.

What happens when you get to a point where you feel that you’re going to have pain no matter what you do? I call this the pain-pain barrier. Often, when this occurs, we become immobilized—we don’t know what to do. Usually we choose what we believe will be the least painful alternative. Some people, however, allow this pain to overwhelm them completely and they experience learned helplessness. (Location 2350)

The greatest leverage you can create for yourself is the pain that comes from inside, not outside. Knowing that you have failed to live up to your own standards for your life is the ultimate pain. If we fail to act in accordance with our own view of ourselves, if our behaviors are inconsistent with our standards—with the identity we hold for ourselves—then the chasm between our actions and who we are drives us to make a change.

A simple way of breaking a pattern is by scrambling the sensations we link to our memories. The only reason we’re upset is that we’re representing things in a certain way in our minds. For example, if your boss yells at you, and you mentally rerun that experience the rest of the day, picturing him or her yelling at you over and over again, then you’ll feel progressively worse. Why let the experience continue to affect you? Why not just take this record in your mind and scratch it so many times that you can’t experience those feelings anymore? Maybe you can even make it funny! (Location 2568)

As simplistic as it seems, effectively scrambling a situation will work in most cases, even where trauma has been involved. Why does it work? Because all of our feelings are based on the images we focus on in our minds and the sounds and sensations we link to those specific images. As we change the images and sounds, we change how we feel. Conditioning this again and again makes it difficult to get back into the old pattern. (Location 2594)

A statistical study was conducted by researcher Nancy Mann to evaluate the level of rehabilitation in reformed drug abusers, and the adoption of a replacement behavior appears to play a major role even in this complex field of change.2 The first group in the study was forced to give up their addiction through some external pressure, often applied by the legal system. As we talked about in the section on leverage, external pressure rarely has a lasting impact. (Location 2640)

key: if the dolphin is always rewarded, he may become habituated and will no longer give 100 percent. So, in the future, the dolphin is rewarded sometimes after the first jump or perhaps after the fifth, or after the second. A dolphin is never sure which jump will be rewarded. This sense of anticipation that a reward may be given, coupled with the uncertainty as to which try will be rewarded, causes the dolphin to consistently give its full effort. The reward is never taken for granted. (Location 2760)

On the next page is a simple checklist that you can use to help yourself be certain that your new success pattern will last and that it’s appropriate. If your attempt at creating this pattern didn’t last, you need to recycle back to Step 1. Are you really clear about what you want and why you want it? Review Step 2; most people who’ve tried unsuccessfully to make a change usually don’t have enough leverage. You may need to make a public commitment in order to get more leverage on yourself. Make it to those people who will not let you off the hook! If you feel that there’s enough leverage, check Step 3: if you know what you want and you’ve got enough leverage, it’s very possible that you’re like the fly beating itself repeatedly against the window pane. You’ve done the same things over and over again, with more and more intensity, but you haven’t changed your approach. You must interrupt your pattern. (Location 2820)

Find a new, empowering alternative for getting yourself out of pain and into pleasure that is as powerful and convenient as your old approach was. All this means is that you now have an opportunity to explore being a little more creative. Find a role model—somebody else who’s been able to eliminate this habit or negative set of emotions that you want to change. (Location 2820)

THE ECOLOGY CHECK 1. Make certain pain is fully associated with the old pattern. When you think of your old behavior or feelings, do you picture and feel things that are painful now instead of pleasurable? 2. Make certain pleasure is fully associated with the new pattern. When you think of your new behavior or feelings, do you picture and feel things that are pleasurable now instead of painful? 3. Align with your values, beliefs, and rules. Is the new behavior or feeling consistent with the values, beliefs, and rules in your life? (We will discuss these in later chapters.) 4. Make sure the benefits of the old pattern have been maintained. Will the new behavior or feeling still allow you to get benefits and feelings of pleasure that you used to get from the old pattern? 5. Future pace—Imagine yourself behaving in this new way in the future. Imagine the thing that would have triggered you to adopt the old pattern. Feel certain that you can use your new pattern instead of the old one. (Location 2833)

Simply being aware of these factors is the foundation for understanding the power of state. Without a doubt, everything you and I do, we do to avoid pain or gain pleasure, but we can instantly change what we believe will lead to pain or pleasure by redirecting our focus and changing our mental-emotional-physiological states.

Emotion is created by motion. Everything that we feel is the result of how we use our bodies.

You can radically raise or lower your intensity of feeling about anything by manipulating submodalities. They affect how you feel about virtually anything, whether you feel joy, frustration, wonder, or despair.

Remember, how you feel about things is instantly changed by a shift in submodalities. For example, think of something that happened yesterday. Just for a moment, picture that experience. Take the image of this memory and put it behind you. Gradually push it back until it’s miles behind you, a tiny, dim dot far off in the darkness. Does it feel like it happened yesterday, or a long time ago? If the memory is great, bring it back. Otherwise, leave it there! Who needs to focus on this memory? By contrast, you’ve had some incredibly wonderful experiences in your life. (Location 3218)

Knowing the large part that submodalities play in your experience of reality is crucial in meeting challenges. For example, whether you feel confused or on track is a matter of submodalities. If you think about a time when you felt confused, remember whether you were representing the experience as a picture or a movie. Then compare it to a time when you felt that you understood something. Often when people feel confused, it’s because they have a series of images in their heads that are piled up too closely together in a chaotic jumble because someone has been talking too rapidly or loudly.

Bam! I broke through one piece of wood, then two pieces, then three pieces, then four. What had I done to accomplish this? 1) I raised my standards and made breaking the wood a must—something I previously would have accepted as a limitation; 2) I changed my limiting belief about my ability to do this by changing my emotional state into one of certainty, and 3) I modeled an effective strategy for producing the result.

THE MORNING POWER QUESTIONS Our life experience is based on what we focus on. The following questions are designed to cause you to experience more happiness, excitement, pride, gratitude, joy, commitment, and love every day of your life. Remember, quality questions create a quality life. Come up with two or three answers to all of these questions and feel fully associated. If you have difficulty discovering an answer simply add the word “could.” Example: “What could I be most happy about in my life now?” (Location 3869)

Often, the first emotional, gut-level response you get to any question is the one you should trust and act upon. This is the final point I want to make with you.

People with an impoverished vocabulary live an impoverished emotional life; people with rich vocabularies have a multi-hued palette of colors with which to paint their experience, not only for others, but for themselves as well. Most people are not challenged, though, by the size of the vocabulary they consciously understand, but rather by the words they choose to use. Many times, we use words as “short cuts,” but often these short cuts shortchange us emotionally. (Location 3990)

A related distinction is that if you don’t have a way of representing something, you can’t experience it.

Early in our relationship, we would often get into what we used to call “pretty intense arguments.” But after discovering the power of the labels we put on our experience to alter that experience, we agreed to refer to these “conversations” as “spirited debates.” That changed our whole perception of it. A “spirited debate” has different rules than an argument, and it definitely has a different emotional intensity to it. In seven years, we’ve never returned to that habitual level of emotional intensity that we had previously associated with our “arguments.” (Location 4230)

What if you believed life is sacred? If that were your primary metaphor, you might have more reverence for it—or you might think that you weren’t allowed to have so much fun. What if you believe life is a gift? All of a sudden it becomes a surprise, something fun, something special. What if you think life is a dance? Wouldn’t that be a kick? It would be something beautiful, something you do with other people, something with grace, rhythm, and joy. Which of these metaphors properly represents life? They’re probably all useful at different times to help you interpret what you need to do to make changes. But remember, all metaphors carry benefits in some context, and limitations in others.

Again, as you identify what you’re really feeling, you can lower the intensity even more, which makes it much easier to learn from the emotion. (Location 5210)

STEP TWO Acknowledge and Appreciate Your Emotions, Knowing They Support You You never want to make your emotions wrong. The idea that anything you feel is “wrong” is a great way to destroy honest communication with yourself as well as with others. (Location 5212)

Here are four questions to ask yourself to become curious about your emotions: What do I really want to feel? What would I have to believe in order to feel the way I’ve been feeling? What am I willing to do to create a solution and handle this right now? What can I learn from this? As you get curious about your emotions, you’ll learn important distinctions about them, not only today, but in the future as well. (Location 5229)

You want to feel certain that you can handle this emotion easily in the future by having a great plan to do so. One way to do this is to simply remember the ways you’ve handled it in the past, and rehearse handling situations where this Action Signal would come up in the future. (Location 5248)

Now that you’ve finished the first five steps—identified what you were really feeling, appreciated the emotion instead of fighting it, gotten curious about what it really meant and the lesson it was offering you, learned from it, figured out how to turn things around by modeling your successful past strategies for handling the emotion, and rehearsed dealing with it in future situations and installed a sense of certainty—the final step is obvious: Get excited, and take action!

THE TEN ACTION SIGNALS (Location 5271)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/action-signals #domain/psychology #insight/framework
Tags: #insight/key-point
Tags: #insight/key-point
  
DISCOMFORT. Uncomfortable emotions don’t have a tremendous amount of intensity, but they do bother us and create the nagging sensation that things are not quite right. The Message: Boredom, impatience, unease, distress, or mild embarrassment are all sending you a message that something is not quite right. (Location 5281)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/discomfort-signals #concept/emotional-intelligence #domain/psychology #insight/definition
Tags: #insight/definition
Tags: #insight/definition
  
The Solution: Dealing with emotions of discomfort is simple: 1) Use the skills you’ve already learned in this book to change your state; 2) Clarify what you do want; and 3) Refine your actions. Try a slightly different approach and see if you can’t immediately change the way you’re feeling about the situation and/or change the quality of results you’re producing. (Location 5286)

Tags: #apply/experiment #insight/action #insight/framework
FEAR. Fearful emotions include everything from low levels of concern and apprehension to intense worry, anxiety, fright, and even terror. Fear serves a purpose, and its message is simple. (Location 5295)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/emotional-intelligence #domain/psychology #insight/definition
Tags: #apply/immediate
Tags: #apply/immediate
  
The Message: Fear is simply the anticipation that something that’s going to happen soon needs to be prepared for. In the words of the Boy Scout motto, “Be prepared.” We need either to prepare to cope with the situation, or to do something to change it. The tragedy is that most people either try to deny their fear, or they wallow in it. Neither of these approaches is respecting the message that fear is trying to deliver, so it will continue to pursue you as it tries to get its message across. (Location 5298)

The Solution: Review what you were feeling fearful about and evaluate what you must do to prepare yourself mentally. Figure out what actions you need to take to deal with the situation in the best possible way. (Location 5304)

Sometimes we’ve done all the preparation we could for something; there’s nothing else we can do—but we still sit around in fear. This is the point when you must use the antidote to fear: you must make a decision to have faith, knowing you’ve done all you can to prepare for whatever you’re fearing, and that most fears in life rarely come to fruition. If they do, you may experience… (Location 5306)

Tags: #insight/action #insight/key-point #insight/principle
HURT. If there’s any one emotion that seems to dominate human relationships, both personal and professional, it’s the emotion of hurt. Feelings of hurt are usually generated by a sense of loss. When people are hurt, they often lash out at others. We need to hear the real message hurt gives us. (Location 5310)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/emotional-intelligence #concept/relationship-dynamics #domain/psychology #insight/definition
Tags: #domain/psychology #insight/statistic
Tags: #domain/psychology #insight/statistic
  
Tags: #insight/key-point
The Message: The message the hurt signal gives us is that we have an expectation that has not been met. Many times this feeling arises when we’ve expected somebody to keep their word and they didn’t (even if you didn’t tell them your expectation that, for example, they not share with someone else what you talked with them about). In this case, you feel a loss of intimacy with this person, maybe a loss of trust. That sense of loss is what creates the feeling of hurt. (Location 5313)

Tags: #insight/example #insight/statistic
Tags: #insight/example #insight/statistic
  
Tags: #insight/key-point
The Solution: 1) Realize that in reality you may not have lost anything. Maybe what you need to lose is the false perception that this person is trying to wound or hurt you. Maybe they really don’t realize the impact of their actions on your life. (Location 5318)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/perception-reframing #domain/psychology #insight/action #priority/high
Tags: #apply/experiment #domain/philosophy #insight/action
Tags: #apply/experiment #domain/philosophy #insight/action
  
Tags: #apply/experiment #apply/mindset #insight/action #insight/key-point
Secondly, take a moment and reevaluate the situation. Ask yourself, “Is there really loss here? Or am I judging this situation too soon, or too harshly?” (Location 5320)
Tags: #apply/immediate #concept/self-reflection #domain/psychology #insight/question
Tags: #insight/question
Tags: #insight/question
  
A third solution that can help you get out of a sense of hurt is to elegantly and appropriately communicate your feeling of loss to the person involved. Tell them, “The other day when X-Y-Z happened, I misinterpreted that to mean that you didn’t care, and I have a sense of loss. Can you clarify for me what really happened?” Simply by changing your communication style and clarifying what’s really going on, you will often find that hurt disappears in a matter of moments.

ANGER. Angry emotions include everything from being mildly irritated to being angry, resentful, furious, or even enraged. (Location 5327)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/emotional-spectrum #domain/psychology #insight/definition
  
The Message: The message of anger is that an important rule or standard that you hold for your life has been violated by someone else, or maybe even by you. (We’ll talk more about this in Chapter 16 on rules.) When you get the message of anger, you need to understand that you can literally change this emotion in a moment. (Location 5329)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/anger-response #concept/emotional-rules #domain/psychology #insight/definition
Tags: #priority/high
Tags: #priority/high
  
The Solution: 1) Realize that you may have misinterpreted the situation completely, that your anger about this person breaking your rules may be based on the fact that they don’t know what’s most important to you (even though you believe they should). 2) Realize that even if a person did violate one of your standards, your rules are not necessarily the “right” rules, even though you feel as strongly as you do about them. 3) Ask yourself a more empowering question like “In the long run, is it true that this person really cares about me?” Interrupt the anger by asking yourself, “What can I learn from this? How can I communicate the importance of these standards I hold for myself to this person in a way that causes them to want to help me, and not violate my standards again in the future?” (Location 5333)

FRUSTRATION. Frustration can come from many avenues. Any time we feel like we’re surrounded by roadblocks in our lives, where we are continuously putting out effort but not receiving rewards, we tend to feel the emotion of frustration. (Location 5345)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/frustration #domain/psychology #insight/definition
Tags: #insight/example #insight/statistic
Tags: #insight/example #insight/statistic
  
Tags: #insight/key-point
The Message: The message of frustration is an exciting signal. It means that your brain believes you could be doing better than you currently are. Frustration is very different from disappointment, which is the feeling that there’s something you want in your life but you’ll never get it. By contrast, frustration is a very positive sign. It means that the solution to your problem is within range, but what you’re currently doing isn’t working, and you need to change your approach in order to achieve your goal. It’s a signal for you to become more flexible! How do you deal with frustration? (Location 5348)

The Solution: 1) Realize that frustration is your friend, and brainstorm new ways to get a result. How can you flex your approach? 2) Get some input on how to deal with the situation. Find a role model, someone who has found a way to get what you want. Ask them for input on how you might more effectively produce your desired result. 3) Get fascinated by what you can learn that could help you handle this challenge not only today, but in the future, in a way that consumes very little time or energy and actually creates joy. Much more devastating than frustration, however, is the emotion of… (Location 5354)

DISAPPOINTMENT. Disappointment can be a very destructive emotion if you don’t deal with it quickly. Disappointment is the devastating feeling of being “let down” or that you’re going to miss out on something forever. Anything that makes you feel sad or defeated as a result of expecting more than you get is disappointing. (Location 5360)

Tags: #apply/immediate #domain/psychology
Tags: #apply/immediate #domain/psychology
  
Tags: #insight/action #insight/key-point
The Message: The message disappointment offers you is that an expectation you have had—a goal you were really going for—is probably not going to happen, so it’s time to change your expectations to make them more appropriate for this situation and take action to set and achieve a new goal immediately. And that is the solution. (Location 5363)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/expectation-management #concept/goal-adjustment #domain/psychology #insight/principle
Tags: #apply/immediate
Tags: #apply/immediate
  
The Solution: 1) Immediately figure out something you can learn from this situation that could help you in the future to achieve the very thing you were after in the first place. 2) Set a new goal, something that will be even more inspiring, and something you can make immediate progress toward. 3) Realize that you may be judging too soon. Often the things you’re disappointed about are only temporary challenges, very much like in the story of Billy Joel in Chapter 2. As I’ve said, you and I need to remember that God’s delays are not God’s denials. (Location 5367)

GUILT. The emotions of guilt, regret, and remorse are among the emotions human beings do most to avoid in life, and this is valuable. They are painful emotions for us to experience, but they, too, serve a valuable function, one which becomes apparent once we hear the message. (Location 5380)

Tags: #insight/definition #insight/warning
Tags: #insight/definition #insight/warning

Guilt is the ultimate leverage for many people in changing a behavior. However, some people try to deal with their guilt by denying and suppressing it. Unfortunately, this rarely works. Guilt does not go away; it only comes back stronger. (Location 5388)

The Solution: 1) Acknowledge that you have, in fact, violated a critical standard you hold for yourself. 2) Absolutely commit yourself to making sure this behavior will never happen again in the future. Rehearse in your mind how, if you could live it again, you could deal with the same situation you feel guilty about in a way that is consistent with your own highest personal standards.

INADEQUACY. This feeling of unworthiness occurs anytime we feel we can’t do something we should be able to do. The challenge, of course, is that often we have a completely unfair rule for determining whether we’re inadequate or not. First, understand the message inadequacy is giving you. (Location 5404)

Tags: #insight/principle

The Message: The message is that you don’t presently have a level of skill necessary for the task at hand. It’s telling you that you need more information, understanding, strategies, tools or confidence. (Location 5406)

The Solution: 1) Simply ask yourself, “Is this really an appropriate emotion for me to feel in this situation? Am I really inadequate, or do I have to change the way I’m perceiving things?” Maybe you’ve convinced yourself that in order to feel adequate, you have to go out on the dance floor and outdo Michael Jackson.

Whenever you feel inadequate, appreciate the encouragement to improve. Remind yourself that you’re not “perfect,” and that you don’t need to be.

Find a role model—someone who’s effective in the area in which you feel inadequate—and get some coaching from them. Just the process of deciding to master this area of your life and making even the smallest amount of progress will turn a person who’s inadequate into a person who’s learning. This emotion is critical, because when someone feels inadequate, they tend to fall into the trap of learned helplessness, and they begin to see the problem as being a permanent one with themselves.

When we begin to feel that problems are permanent or pervasive or we have more things to deal with than we can possibly imagine, we tend to succumb to the emotions of… 9. OVERLOAD OR OVERWHELM.

Tags: #insight/key-point
The Message: The message of being overwhelmed is that you need to reevaluate what’s most important to you in this situation. The reason you’re overloaded is that you’re trying to deal with too many things at once, and you’re trying to change everything overnight. The feeling of being overloaded or overwhelmed disrupts and destroys more people’s lives than just about any other emotion. (Location 5430)

Our self-esteem is often tied to our ability to control our environments.

Probably the emotion that most people fear the most, however, is that feeling of disconnection, also known as… 10. LONELINESS.

The Message: The message of loneliness is that you need a connection with people. But what does the message mean? People often assume it means a sexual connection, or instant intimacy. Then they feel frustrated, because even when they do have intimacy, they still feel lonely. The Solution: 1) The solution to loneliness is to realize that you can reach out and make a connection immediately and end the loneliness. There are caring people everywhere. (Location 5451)

Identify what kind of connection you do need. Do you need an intimate connection? Maybe you just need some basic friendship, or someone to listen to you or to laugh or talk with. You simply have to identify what your true needs are. 3) Remind yourself that what’s great about being lonely is that it means, “I really care about people, and I love to be with them. I need to find out what kind of connection I need with somebody right now, and then take an action immediately to make that happen.” 4) Then, take immediate action to reach out and connect with someone.

LOVE AND WARMTH. The consistent expression of love seems to be able to melt almost any negative emotions it comes in contact with. If someone is angry with you, you can easily remain loving with them by adopting a core belief such as this marvelous one from the book A Course in Miracles: all communication is either a loving response or a cry for help.

CURIOSITY. If you really want to grow in your life, learn to be as curious as a child. Children know how to wonder—that’s why they’re so endearing. If you want to cure boredom, be curious. If you’re curious, nothing is a chore; it’s automatic—you want to study. Cultivate curiosity, and life becomes an unending study of joy. (Location 5488)

Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/motivation #concept/passion #domain/psychology #insight/principle
  
DETERMINATION. All of the above emotions are invaluable, but there is one that you must have if you’re going to create lasting value in this world. It will dictate how you deal with upsets and challenges, with disappointment and disillusionments. Determination means the difference between being stuck and being struck with the lightning power of commitment (Location 5499)

In order to get yourself to do anything, it’s imperative to exercise confidence rather than fear.

But remember: the source of success for outstanding achievers often finds its origin in a set of nurtured beliefs for which that individual had no references!

In order to take our lives to the next level, however, we must realize that the same pattern of thinking that has gotten us to where we are will not get us to where we want to go. One of the biggest challenges I see in both individuals and corporations is that they resist change (their greatest ally), justifying their actions by pointing out that their current behavior is what got them to the level of success that they now enjoy. This is absolutely true and, in reality, a new level of thinking is now required in order to experience a new level of personal and professional success. (Location 6375)

Why would we continually indulge in mental and emotional patterns that create unnecessary stress in our lives? The answer is simple: we actually think it helps! Many people live in a state of worry. In order to accomplish this state, they continually focus and dwell on the worst possible scenario. Why would they do this? Because they believe it will get them to do something—to take action. But the truth of the matter is that worry usually puts a person in an extremely unresourceful emotional state. (Location 6431)

Every great, successful person I know shares the capacity to remain centered, clear and powerful in the midst of emotional “storms.” How do they accomplish this? Most of them have a fundamental rule: In life, never spend more than 10 percent of your time on the problem, and spend at least 90 percent of your time on the solution. Most important, don’t sweat the small stuff… and remember, it’s all small stuff! (Location 6454)

There are four simple yet important rules to this Ten-Day Challenge. So if you’re going to take it on, remember the following: THE TEN-DAY MENTAL CHALLENGE—RULES OF THE GAME Rule 1. In the next ten consecutive days, refuse to dwell on any unresourceful thoughts or feelings. Refuse to indulge in any disempowering questions or devitalizing vocabulary or metaphors. Rule 2. When you catch yourself beginning to focus on the negative—and you certainly will—you are to immediately use the techniques you’ve learned to redirect your focus toward a better emotional state. Specifically, use the Problem-Solving Questions2 as your first line of attack; for example: “What’s great about this? What’s not perfect yet?” Remember, by asking a question like, “What’s not perfect yet?,” you’re presupposing that things will be perfect. This will change your state. It doesn’t ignore the problem, but it keeps you in the right state while you identify what needs to be changed. In addition, set yourself up for success each morning for the next ten days by asking yourself the Morning Power Questions. You can do them before you get out of bed or while you’re in the shower, but make sure you do them right away. This will focus you in the direction of establishing empowering mental and emotional patterns each day as you awake. In the evening, use the Evening Power Questions, or any questions you believe will put you in a great state before you drop off to sleep. Rule 3. For the next ten consecutive days, make certain that your whole focus in life is on solutions and not on problems. The minute you see a possible challenge, immediately focus on what the solution could be. Rule 4. If you backslide—that is, if you catch yourself indulging in or dwelling on an unresourceful thought or feeling—don’t beat yourself up. There’s no problem with this as long as you change immediately. However, if you continue to dwell on unresourceful thoughts or feelings for any measurable length of time, you must wait until the following morning and start the ten days over. The goal of this program is ten consecutive days without holding or dwelling on a negative thought. This starting-over process must happen no matter how many days in a row you’ve already accomplished the task. (Location 6463)

You will be demanding empowering emotions, enriching thoughts, inspiring questions. With a clear-cut moving-away idea (the pain of starting over) you are giving your brain strong signals to search for empowering patterns. By setting a higher standard for what thoughts you’ll allow your mind to dwell on, you’ll begin to notice the garbage and destructive patterns you used to blindly or lazily accept from yourself.

Or we can make the second kind of change: a global change. A metaphor for this might be that if we want to change the way your computer is processing data, I can change the software that you’re using so that when you hit the keys what shows up on the screen is formatted differently. (Location 6778)

So instead of just conditioning yourself to feel differently about rejection and eliminating the fearful behaviors, you can adopt a new global belief that says, “I am the source of all my emotions. Nothing and no one can change how I feel except me. If I find myself in reaction to anything, I can change it in a moment.” (Location 6782)

What you truly value—the ends you’re after—are love, security, and happiness. Similarly, with money, I could ask you, “What does money really mean to you? What does it give you?” You might say, “Freedom, impact, the ability to contribute, a sense of security.” Again, you see, money is merely a means to achieving a much deeper set of values, a set of emotions that you desire to experience on a consistent basis in your life.

We’ve allowed our environment to shape us, but we can begin to change this now. How? Simply by taking two steps: Step One is to gain awareness of what your current values are so you understand why you do what you do. What are the emotional states you are moving toward, and what are the states you are moving away from? By reviewing your lists side by side, you’ll be able to have an understanding of the force that’s creating your present and future. Step Two: You can then make conscious decisions about what values you want to live by in order to shape the quality of life and destiny you truly desire and deserve. (Location 7269)

So how can you now take control of this third element of your Master System known as values? Take the following two simple steps: Step 1. Find out what your current values are, and rank them in order of importance. This will give you insight into what you want to experience most—your moving-toward values—and what you want to avoid most in your life—your moving-away-from values. It will give you an understanding of why you do what you do. It will also offer you the opportunity, if you’d like, to consistently experience more pleasure in your life by understanding the pain-pleasure system that’s already built within you. (Location 7399)

Step 2. If you’re willing to take the bull by the horns, you have an opportunity to redirect your destiny. Ask yourself a new question: “What do my values need to be in order to achieve the destiny I desire and deserve?” Brainstorm out a list. Put them in order. See which values you might get rid of and which values you might add in order to create the quality of life you truly want. (Location 7405)

There are certain rules that, to break them, would give us such intense pain that we don’t even consider the possibility. We will rarely, if ever, break them. I call these rules threshold rules.

Conversely, we have some rules that we don’t want to break. I call these personal standards. If we do break them, we don’t feel good about it, but depending upon the reasons, we’re willing to break them in the short term. (Location 7915)

RULES REALIGNMENT Right now, begin to take control of your rules by writing down your answers to the following questions. Make your answers as thorough as possible. 1. What does it take for you to feel successful? 2. What does it take for you to feel loved—by your kids, by your spouse, by your parents, and by whoever else is important to you? 3. What does it take for you to feel confident? 4. What does it take for you to feel you are excellent in any area of your life? (Location 7962)
