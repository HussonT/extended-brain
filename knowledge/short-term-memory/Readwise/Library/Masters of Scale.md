When you talk to people who have scaled a business—and we have talked to many, at length and in depth—you begin to uncover some counterintuitive truths about scaling: The best, most scalable ideas are often the ones that seem the most implausible. An encounter with resistance at the start of your journey is a good thing. Early, honest feedback from the right people will have an outsized impact on helping you refine your idea. Doing things that don’t scale—especially at the earliest stages—can set you up for dramatic scale later on. Even if everything you thought you knew turns out to be wrong, you can still achieve your goals—as long as you accept the truth and adjust your plan. Lessons like these were learned the hard way by the seventy extraordinary people featured in this book. They are among the most iconic entrepreneurs behind the disruptive companies that have shaped our cultural landscape. Among the pantheon of modern scale leaders sharing their stories with us: Bill Gates, Mark Cuban, Starbucks’ Howard Schultz, Netflix’s Reed Hastings, Apple’s Angela Ahrendts, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, Airbnb’s Brian Chesky, YouTube’s Susan Wojcicki, Spotify’s Daniel Ek, Canva’s Melanie Perkins, Xapo’s Wences Casares, Spanx’s Sara Blakely, the Black List’s Franklin Leonard, ClassPass’s Payal Kadakia, Duolingo’s Luis von Ahn, Minted’s Mariam Naficy, Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer, Walker & Company’s Tristan Walker, designer Tory Burch, investor and philanthropist Robert F. Smith, and media maven Arianna Huffington. These leaders represent a wide range of industries as well as the nonprofit world. They hail from all over the world—from rural towns to urban housing projects (and everywhere in between). In the pages ahead, you’ll learn not just about their winning strategies but also their embarrassing mistakes and their dark moments of defeat. At times, it may feel a bit like you’re eavesdropping on a private conversation between them and the book’s expert navigator, Reid Hoffman, (Location 58)

“When I started pitching to investors, I ran into a couple of big problems,” Kathryn says. “The first is that most investors don’t match the user archetype that our product was built for. When you think about the classic venture capitalist, they often have been traditionally successful in their career, went to a top school, worked in banking or private equity. (Location 138)

When you’re still early and unproven in your career—and you’re getting “Nos” from some of the smartest and most successful investors in Silicon Valley and New York City—it can be difficult not to ask yourself, “What if the naysayers are right?” But at the end of the day, you have to listen to your gut instinct.

We’re taught to get to “Yes” as quickly as we can—but there’s so much more to gain by seeking out and celebrating the “Nos.” (Location 171)

What follows are some examples of the various forms of “No” that founders encounter when challenging the world with an idea. Notice their willingness to ask for more feedback and hear what the world has to say as they embrace the naysayers in order to refine their product and move closer to scale. (Location 176)

But scalable ideas don’t have to tackle dramatic problems—they have to tackle neglected problems. And the more that Tristan looked into the history of shaving, the more he realized that there was a hugely overlooked demographic—men with coarse or curly facial hair—who had been living with the curse of razor burns and razor bumps for so long, they no longer even recognized it was a problem.

Short answer: Because some “Nos” count more than others. “Substantial nos” can revise your idea. “Skeptical nos” can force you to rethink the size of the opportunity. These are “Nos” worth listening to and learning from. But then, there are “lazy nos,” and these you need to dismiss and move on from—quickly. (Location 259)

One of the things first-time investors don’t often realize is in the end it doesn’t matter how many “Nos” you get. The right “Yes” is the only thing you need. (Location 276)

The first truth of entrepreneurship and investing: The biggest new ideas are contrarian. They go so deeply against commonly held assumptions that they seem not only risky but flat-out ridiculous. They’re the kind of ideas that draw a lot of “Nos.” (Location 331)

You don’t have to get them to a “Yes,” but you’re hoping to detect some friction as they reason their way to a “No.” This “squirmy no”—the space between a “No” and a “Yes”—is a clue that you may be on to something truly big, because the best ideas make people want to say “Yes” and “No” (Location 402)

“The lazy no” Potential investors may completely miss the point of your idea or simply be ignorant. Either way, once it becomes clear that they aren’t trying to gain a better understanding, you need to move on from these naysayers—quickly. Their “No” gives you no additional information. “The squirmy no” The best, highest-potential ideas make investors want to say “Yes” and “No” in the same breath. This signals that the idea might be great, although of course it might be a very attractive disaster. “The affirmative no” Sometimes an expert’s “No” is proof you’re on the path to something big and different. The key: You should have an active theory about why you are right and the experts are wrong—more than a gut feeling or simply grit, but another signal for a potentially great idea. “The honest no” Frequently, the experts are right. You have to be ruthless about killing your own bad ideas along the way—and an honest “No” could be a lifeline to turn a bad idea into something good, or to help you move on to a better idea. “The unhelpful no” If you’re the kind of person who might get easily discouraged or talked out of your idea, you need to keep your idea away from people whose opinions you have an emotional investment in.

Instead of just asking what people thought about the product as it existed now, he’d ask what they thought about the product he might build. “If I ask, ‘What can I do to make this better?’ they’ll say something small,” Brian explains. So instead, he’d ask bigger, bolder questions, like “What can we do to surprise you?” or “What would it take for me to design something that you would literally tell every single person you’ve ever encountered?” In doing so, he invited users to join him in imagining a bigger, bolder version of Airbnb.

It starts by forcing you to imagine things you could never actually do. Why? Because that’s how you win. “The core thesis is if you want to build a massively successful company, you need to build something that people love so much they tell each other. Which means that you must build something worth talking about. And if you want to build something worth talking about, you have to go back to things that don’t scale.” (Location 654)

But they serve a serious purpose. “The point of the process is that maybe 9, 10, 11 are not feasible,” Brian explains. “But if you go through the crazy exercise, there’s some sweet spot between ‘They showed up and they opened the door’ and ‘I went to space.’ That’s the sweet spot. You have to almost design the extreme to come backward.” (Location 654)

In fact, my favorite definition (courtesy of Jeff Weiner) is: Trust = Consistency Over Time When you’re very consistent in following through on your promises—and when you do this over and over again to establish a deep, unbroken pattern—that creates trust. (Location 942)

But as an entrepreneur, you often don’t have time. And so you need to find shortcuts—or bridges. And there are three great ones I know of. One effective bridge to trust: Get someone that people already trust to endorse you, or to be the articulator of your value proposition. This is trust by the transitive property. So that people say, “Well, if this person who I trust endorses this, or agrees to it—then it’s trustworthy.” A second bridge might be making a substantial and costly commitment or guarantee—as Daniel Ek did when he enticed the music industry to try out Spotify by putting the industry’s monetary interests ahead of his own. You want your commitment to show that you’re really putting something on the line—that you not only have skin in the game, and not only are putting their interests ahead of yours, but stand to lose big if you fail them: “If we break trust in this way, then in each instance we’ll pay you X dollars or we’ll donate Y dollars to charity.” A third bridge is to be radically transparent. You might share all of your code. Or post an online bulletin board that all of your customers can use, and that everyone can see. Or offer to do an “Ask Me Anything” interaction and be completely open to any question. (Location 946)

“Because I’m ‘ready fire aim’—and I need a ‘ready aim fire’ person to partner with me and complement my skill set. You gotta be brutally honest.” Mark and his co-founders helped pioneer the first wave of PC networking—from one just-got-fired salesman in a $50 suit to $30 million in annual sales in only seven years. MicroSolutions was acquired by CompuServe at the dawn of the 1990s, leaving Mark with a payout that would allow him to retire from business at thirty. (Which he did, for a time. But as we know now, it didn’t stick.) — Long before Mark founded and sold Broadcast.com, long before he became a legendary investor on prime-time TV, he had the entrepreneurial mindset—a mindset not just for business but for finding big ideas and making them work. And as you can see in his story, you don’t need any of the traditional ingredients to make a great idea succeed. You don’t need an MBA, you don’t need access to capital, and you definitely don’t need lightning to strike. What you need is the right mindset. You need curiosity—so you’re always asking: Could this work? Could this be a business? Could this be the idea? You need a bias to action—so when you spot an idea with potential, you move on it. You need to collaborate—to tap the ideas and strengths of other people, so you can improve your idea and actualize it. And finally, you need grit—to persist through the inevitable failures along the way. And there will be failures. “We’ve all had failures. Even when you do all the things you need to do, you’re still going to have failures and mistakes,” Mark says. (Location 1008)

Chase the bad idea When everyone is telling you, “That’s a good idea,” it can mean lots of other people are likely already pursuing it. Instead, look for the beautiful idea disguised as a bad one—the idea whose potential value is unseen or misunderstood. If not you, who? When you take a penetrating look at your history and passions, your destiny idea may be staring right back at you. Pay attention to the flashing neon sign If you believe that something should exist—and you can imagine many other people nodding in agreement—it may just be an idea worth pursuing. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel When searching for a big idea, don’t discount the “slight twist” that can have a major impact. The Hail Mary Never let a crisis go to waste. Desperate times can sharpen focus, strengthen resolve…and yield killer ideas, while also creating the urgency to act on them. (Location 1415)

The psychologist and Wharton School professor Adam Grant, who has written extensively on business culture, says, “As a founder trying to build a culture, the first thing you do is say, ‘It is nice to have the right people on your bus, but it is even more critical to keep the wrong people off your bus.’ Every founder, when it comes to hiring, should be asking, ‘What are the qualities that I am absolutely unwilling to let into the organization?’ ” (Location 1752)

It was the sign she’d been awaiting, as it told her the exact position of the setting sun and where it would touch down. Once she knew the direction of the sun, she could calculate her position and figure out everything she needed to resume her journey. “I can take stock of my entire horizon—the wind, the ocean, the waves—as they relate to this sign,” she says. “Everyone is really excited now, because we’ve all been looking for this.” The crew adjusts course, homing in on the latitude of Hawaii on the east side of the Big Island. “I’m confident now and I’m getting continuous signals that I’m on the right path.

“The reality is, your most dangerous competitors are rarely the big guys, like eBay. They are hesitant to storm the field and take the risk alongside you.

One way is to say: “We have six people. We’re going to have one or two people spend 10 to 20 percent of their time devoted to experiments on top of our baseline product.” When you’re choosing the specific areas of expansion, there are a few critical questions you can ask: What are the things I’d want to experiment with? To go deeper on that question: What are the things that I see as adjacent to what I’m doing or as potential venture bets that could greatly expand where my product and service get to? Alternatively, a key question can be: What would I want to do before my competitors do? (Location 2113)

There are a lot of different ways you can ask these questions. You can even ask: If another company was going to try to compete with us, how would they compete with us? Here’s a different variation on these questions that goes to the potential 20 and the potential 10. Ask: What else is happening in the industry? For example, Are there technological platform changes? This could be a move to the cloud, AI, ubiquity of sensors, Internet of Things, drones—these things then might give you an idea of what should be in the 20 and what should be in the 10.There’s no one way to drive strategic growth. But by asking these questions and applying this formula, it becomes easier to direct your growth in a productive way. (Location 2120)

Lean in while sitting back When you embark on the entrepreneurial journey, you have to recognize that the conditions around you are always changing. If you want to go the distance, you sometimes have to be strategically patient. But that doesn’t mean just sitting back and waiting. It means leaning in and watching for the moment to break out and move fast. Sometimes it even means building the capabilities in advance to take advantage of a future opportunity. Start fast but don’t burn yourself out Explosive starts only work if you can sustain the momentum you generate. It’s all about figuring out how explosive you can make those opening steps—without getting fried in the process. Startups are a marathon of sprints. Decide, decide, decide Rapid decision-making is a key to explosive growth. When you’re moving fast, you may make mistakes. But the biggest mistake is not making decisions fast enough, because the only thing that matters is time. Let fires burn When you have a fast-scaling company, the focus must be on moving forward. And it’s hard to do that if you’re spending much of your time putting out fires. Some fires may be too serious to ignore. But others are better left burning. You can never raise enough money Opportunities may arise when you least expect them, and you need to have the capital to carry you in new directions. Make sure to have enough funding left to adequately support a Plan B. Make sure you have enough funding to experiment. Pick your VC partners carefully Look at an investor essentially as a later-stage co-founder—a partner who understands you and your vision for the company. (Location 2351)

It’s worth noting that Eric’s approach is not just about learning—it’s also about how you respond to what you’ve learned, achieving “perfection through iteration.” As with the scientific method, it involves assessing the results of your experiment and asking: Did it bear out my hypothesis? Or do I need to make adjustments? In the business world, those adjustments might be as small as adding a feature or as big as pivoting your entire strategy. (By the way, Eric is the person who popularized this now-ubiquitous term—pivot—which we’ll cover in Chapter 8, “The Art of the Pivot.”) (Location 2636)

Because you need to test a real product with real customers as soon as possible—basically the moment you have a bare-bones version. But the point of releasing ASAP isn’t speed for speed’s sake. It’s to get data from your customers—while you still have enough time to use that data to make improvements. Then you build again, and test again, creating a feedback loop that allows you to continuously improve. And not just a handful of times. (Location 2655)

Be a learn-it-all, not a know-it-all When you’re trying to do something that hasn’t been done before, you often find yourself in a state of supreme ignorance. What enables entrepreneurs to thrive in those conditions is the speed at which they zip up a learning curve. Keep moving away from what you know Success imprints even more strongly than failure. So when you’ve figured out something that works or you’ve found success in a particular area, there’s a natural tendency to stay put. But infinite learners know that if you stand still or keep doing the same things that worked in the past, the world will leave you behind. Collect wisdom along the way Business leaders and entrepreneurs often take a zigzag route to get to their destination. At each stop they should absorb useful bits of learning and add them to their greater understanding of the world. Teach yourself to lead Entrepreneurs who know how to launch a new company often have no idea how to actually run a new company. But there are many ways to learn—by reading, consulting with mentors, and partnering with investors who have worked with other CEOs who’ve gone through the startup process. Experiment to learn, and learn to experiment Your assumptions about what your users or customers want will never be exactly right. Testing a real product with real people as soon as possible is the fastest way to build something that can scale. (Location 2769)

Watch what they do, not what they say Watching what your customers are doing—or trying to do—with your product can light the way forward. But you have to be careful to pay attention to what they do and not just what they say. Expect to have your theories of human behavior tested Your theory about how individuals and groups behave should underlie your strategy, your product design, your incentive program—every decision you make. But be open and alert to when your customers show you a different theory or direction. That could become your product’s point of differentiation. Follow the leaders: Your customers To grow your business, you may have to give up control. Look for instances when your customers hack or hijack your product, and then go along for the ride. Get Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy working together Customer data is your Mr. Spock, detached and logical. Customer emotion is your Dr. McCoy, passionate and all too human. Think of yourself as Captain Kirk, responsible for making the two work together to get the best out of each. (Location 3210)

The rebound: Pivoting in a crisis As the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold in early 2020, Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar noticed some interesting things happening on the Nextdoor platform, originally designed to make it easier for neighbors to get to know one another. First off, engagement levels were up about 80 percent. But beyond that, the nature of the interactions was changing. People weren’t just saying hi and asking for handyman recommendations. They were using the platform to try to determine if anyone out there in the neighborhood needed help during the crisis—and they seemed ready, even eager, to step in and provide it. (Location 3485)

People mistakenly think, “When the company is shutting down, that’s when I will pivot to something else.” But by then it is almost certainly too late. You want to make your move before the market hits you in the face with a two-by-four. (Location 3497)

The shift Even the most focused entrepreneurs who are pursuing a particular vision must constantly shift and adjust to changes in technology, the market, or the world in general. Pivoting in this way doesn’t mean giving up on the vision; in fact, they’re often more successful at pivoting because they’re guided by a vision. The switch Pivots often occur within an existing business: for example, when the company switches from one strategy to a different one. It’s important to get early feedback on changes like this—or at least communicate those changes to as many of your stakeholders as you can before you flip the switch. The swerve Some pivots are reactions to an unexpected development: a new problem or opportunity that suddenly manifests itself. It might be blocking the path forward, requiring a deft sideways maneuver to avoid a crash, or it could be something compelling that has cropped up on the side of the road. You may find it’s worth swerving to investigate and perhaps pursue this new possibility. The reboot A pivot can sometimes—not often, but sometimes—be a complete departure from the original mission of the company. A total reboot like that can work, but it rarely goes off without some bumps. The rebound: Pivoting in a crisis Crises can cause some unwelcome pivots. But they also can offer opportunities to learn, experiment, and make improvements to your current business. So, even while navigating a crisis, look toward the future and ask questions like “Within these constraints, what are the newer creative possibilities? How can we make our business more flexible, and stronger, over the long run?” (Location 3634)

This led to weekly sessions called “PB and J” meetings, which stood for process, bureaucracy, and jams. Anyone in the company could suggest a problem for the Red-Tape Machete to take on, as long as they also proposed a solution for it. Those fixes started to make Yahoo function better—and also had the effect of empowering the people who worked there to be part of the solution. (Location 4107)

The drum major A great leader’s drumbeat doesn’t force people to follow them; it inspires them to move in the same direction of their own volition. Your drumbeat depends on your temperament, your experiences, and your company. Your drumbeat might be focused on efficiency, or innovation, or work-life balance. Or perhaps a mix of all these. The compassionate leader A core tenet of compassionate leadership is being willing to see everything through the lens and perspective of the people around you. It also requires some self-examination and reflection—and an effort to resist emotional, gut reactions. By paying attention to the people you lead and being willing to learn from them, you’re helping your people find their own rhythm. The truth-teller (and seeker) As a truth-teller, be prepared to document the criteria or principles driving your decisions. Doing so creates a clarity in your own mind and helps you communicate your thinking to other people. And while free-flowing feedback is nonnegotiable for radically transparent companies, it’s important to develop protocols and guidelines to keep disagreements and criticism moving in a constructive, positive direction. The connector Whether your staff is seventy thousand people or a team of seven, a leader needs two things to create a strong unified team: an elevated mission and everyday human contact. Inspire people with a guiding mission, then connect them with each other. And then watch them take ownership of that mission and become leaders themselves. The ship captain Many startups have piratical qualities in their early days—scrappiness, inventiveness, a willingness to venture into unknown areas. Rather than trying to tame those qualities by imposing a new culture from the top down, encourage the pirates to help shape and guide the necessary transformation to a culture that looks more like the navy—with rules of engagement, lines of communication, and long-term strategy. The star-maker Hiring stars is expensive and sometimes impossible because the right talent may not be available. The best leaders are those who are able to nurture and develop talent from within. Your role then becomes to identify bottlenecks and clear away obstacles so your new stars can shine. (Location 4129)

But Howard laid out the business case for conscience: “I want to invest in our people,” he said, “and I think I will be able to prove that we will lower attrition, raise performance, but most importantly create the kind of company in which people feel part of something larger than themselves.” (Location 4184)

Many great founders have a secondary purpose, something outside their main business objective they’re trying to get done in the world. In fact, you could say that every successful company is like a Trojan horse carrying the founder’s second purpose forward. (Location 4197)

“Starbucks is not profit driven,” says Howard. “Starbucks is values driven, and as a result of those values, we have become very profitable. Not every business decision should be an economic one. Our financial performance is directly linked to the enduring values and culture that we are constantly trying to enhance and preserve.” (Location 4257)

“Everyone had been calling my Endeavor idea crazy, and I didn’t think it was crazy. And I realized, entrepreneurs don’t think what they’re doing is crazy—though other people do, because it’s threatening to the status quo.” (Location 4291)

Think of your company as a Trojan horse Social transformation shouldn’t just be side effects of your business—if you’re strategic about it, social good can, and should, become the beating heart of your business. It’s not about saying, “I’m a good person, so my company will do good things.” It’s about asking, “What kind of positive impact can I have that will also support my core business?” Bake in goodness from day one If a company has a mission that is rooted in goodness—and if you can effectively communicate that mission to the world and then live up to it—it can become one of the driving forces that helps you scale. You can always pivot to good You don’t necessarily have to start out “good”—but you can still get there. There may be bumps as you have to shift to get your business model right, but if you are going to try to scale good intentions, one of your most powerful tools is the ability to tell a compelling, inspirational story that describes your target future. When good is an add-on feature Even for companies offering a product that’s not associated with improving the world, it can be worthwhile to take a close look at that offering—because there may be some hidden purpose waiting within to be discovered and unlocked. One good place to look is always your employees and engagement with your local communities. Paying it forward One of the most important ways any successful company can contribute to the larger world is by paying it forward. This can take the form of mentoring programs, investing in other startups, or focusing on specific areas—geographic areas or underrepresented groups of people—with the goal of helping to encourage, strengthen, and diversify the next generation of entrepreneurial leaders. Marc Benioff’s 1-1-1 program at Salesforce is a model of commitment. First, do no harm Entrepreneurs bear a responsibility to society. Without the infrastructure of society, we wouldn’t be able to create our businesses and reap the rewards of success. We should follow the principle of the Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm. As entrepreneurs, we should strive to leave society better off than we found it. (Location 4627)
