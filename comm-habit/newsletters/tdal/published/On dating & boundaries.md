I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 months the day before my birthday.

Our first date was after I forgot to reply to her message on Hinge twice - then we matched again on Raya and tried to make plans three times. I asked to reschedule twice. I suggested the first date - a salmon toast at tartine next to golden gate park because I had resolved that I would only go on dates that I wanted to do by myself anyway.

I rain-checked because I wasn’t done with an application for an accelerator that I ended up not getting into. She was so chill about it. I let her pick the spot to which we would re-schedule. She picked “vive-la-tarte” at 10am on a Friday.

As faith would have it - the place was ran by a Belgian woman from Ghent named Julie. I was early or she was a little late - not sure. In any case, I connected with Julie and when my date came in - I was talking to the owner as if I’d known her for years. I was in my element & was about to take her with me in it. Greenlight. I opened with what I later learned was a classic anxious-avoidant move: ”let’s both list three reasons why you shouldn’t date me.”

### Anxious-avoidant scare tactics

This was after another date had gone horribly wrong. After a 2h walk that was supposed to be 30 minutes - I was trying to bring up that I had a daughter & sort of hastily threw it at her which sent that poor woman into a full-blown spiral. I could read almost panic in her eyes. She wanted to leave then and there. I did appreciate that an attempt was made to hide it behind one of those smiles and an excited “what’s her name?”. She was clearly a woman who had a vision for her life and a clear definition of what did or did not fit in there - a guy with a kid wasn’t it.

We went on a second date, but I’m pretty sure she came out of guilt - because how superficial would that reason to not date be. I liked her regardless of all that - ambitious, funny, pretty and we could literally talk non-stop from big ideas to small, fun banter. She broke things off because she was afraid I wasn’t able to keep up with her lifestyle (read: I picked a restaurant that wasn’t expensive enough for the second date). Two weeks later vive-la-tarte happened. Panic-girl messaged me 4 days into dating the other girl to see if i was interested in something casual, even verbatim called me a dilf. Not the first time this happens to me, if u must know. Anyway - point was, that I feel like I learned I needed to be more upfront about the shit that’s fucked about me, or at least could be seen as such.

Hence my almost opening question: let’s both list three reasons why you shouldn’t date me. I started: I have an 8y old daughter [boom can’t fuck that one up again - quick glance at her, no panic in her eyes but some form of endearment. I’m confused.], I’m messy and I’m obsessive meaning I get sucked into work, relationships, … “Hmm, that’s not bad” she says.

And if you’re thinking - Tom, you didn’t push it far enough - don’t worry, I pushed throughout the date. We played a game called truth or drink, where the whole point is to ask each other unhinged questions that you can choose not to answer but then you have to drink. She now knows my favorite porn, I know under which circumstances she would fuck her boss and that she was still kind of in love with her ex.

### Not setting boundaries

All of a sudden it was 11 am. The guy who was eating his avo-toast next to us had taken out his ear-pods at this point. I had a meeting, she had to go to work. That was that. After my meeting I had decided I liked her. There’s this thing they teach you in sales is that you never end a meeting without the next meeting on the books and I had talked her into going on a padel-date with me next Wednesday. But I wanted to see her sooner, so I texted her to ask if she had plans that same night and that if she did we’d still have our padel next week. Another thing they teach you in sales books is - give the illusion of choice. I essentially bamboozled her into watching a movie at her place that same night - and I basically never left after that night.

What followed were 5 months where we would often joked that days felt like years - in a good way. We said we’d be exclusive a week in. I told her I loved her after a month and a half. We talked about marriage when I ran into some visa scares. We’d really started developing a “we-vision” instead of an “I-vision”. The problem was that I didn’t really know her - neither did she really know me. I went off of vibes. That’s what they do in the movies no? And we are both fun people - so of course it was fun. But looking back, I realized I was playing-relationship. I was doing what I thought people in relationships do.

I was ignoring some of the intuitions I had because I mistook them for my unhealed avoidant parts trying to sabotage me out of something good. I was ignoring the fact that I felt small when I was around her friends. Or that I was worried about her when I brought her around mine. Or that I’d started drinking again after being sober for almost 2 years. That I’d been breaking my role of smoking once a month on a friday. That I’d stopped meditating. That I hadn’t read a book while I just to read one a week. That I’d watched more tv than I had in a month than in the past 2 years combined.

Looking back, it’s so obvious what this is: self-betrayal. It’s me crossing my own boundaries. And the crazy part was - she wasn’t even asking me to do any of this. She started reading with me in bed every evening (well for two weeks at least). The problem was, there were some things that I’d already “compromised” on that I only later realized were important to me in a partner that were just not who she was. And asking her to change to that degree would mean massive self-betrayal for her.

### What I learned

We weren’t a match - and dating at a normal pace would’ve probably let us down much easier.

So the big lesson for me from all this are threefold:

1. **Don’t front-load the scary shit, let it blossom.** Don’t front-load all your ugly stuff to try to scare her or have something to point to to be like “see, she was gonna leave anyway”. In short: don’t make your first question “what are all the reasons you shouldn’t date”. Play truth or drink, but that’s a date no3 idea. Let it blossom. You’re creating a false feeling of closeness - and its cheating bc im only sharing the wounds that are healed.
2. **Set the boundaries - you’re an asshole if you don’t set them.** For some reason I used to think i’m an asshole for setting them - but I think it comes down to the kind not nice thing. She was actually deeply hurt from this breakup for no fault of her own. We could have avoided this pain, and spent more time with people that are a fit for us if we’d been better at exploring our boundaries and what we need and keep sustainably giving. Not unimportant if you’re building for the longrun.
3. **Breaks are a cop-out. Don’t be a pussy.** You’ll never be 100% certain, but half-jumps are so much more painful than full ones. I proposed a break on sunday to break up on wednesday but I was already sure I wanted to break up the friday before. So scratch that, you can be a 100% certain if you align gut, head, heart & listen to what that tingling little intuition feeling says. You just have to have the balls to act on a little faint signal.

The way I handled the breakup can be a whole other post - I guess that for next time. TL;DR could’ve done it better, but also could’ve done way worse. Lmk if u want to hear about that next week lol.
