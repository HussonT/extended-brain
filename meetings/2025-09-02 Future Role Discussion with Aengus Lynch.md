# Meeting: Future Role & Compensation Discussion with Aengus Lynch

## 📋 Pre-Meeting Preparation

### Meeting Objective
**Primary Goal:** Negotiate and clarify my role, compensation, and equity at WatertightAI
**Success Criteria:** 
- Clear understanding of role expectations and growth trajectory
- Agreement on fair compensation package (salary + equity)
- Alignment on mutual value creation and long-term vision

### Context & Background
- **Current situation:** Joining WatertightAI as a new team member
- **Key challenges:** Establishing fair compensation in startup context, balancing cash vs equity, defining role scope
- **His position:** CEO/Founder with AI safety background, likely balancing runway with talent acquisition

### My Preparation Checklist
- [x] Research market rates for my role
- [x] Review Chris Voss negotiation tactics
- [x] Prepare value proposition
- [ ] Practice calibrated questions
- [ ] Review his background and motivations
- [ ] Prepare BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)
- [ ] Identify "Black Swans" - unknown unknowns that could change everything

### Questions to Address (Using Calibrated Questions - Chris Voss)
1. **"How do you see my role evolving over the next 6-12 months?"** (Creates vision of future value)
2. **"What does success look like for this position?"** (Gets him to define winning)
3. **"How did you arrive at the compensation structure you're thinking about?"** (Uncovers reasoning)
4. **"What would need to happen for us to revisit compensation in 6 months?"** (Sets future negotiation)
5. **"Help me understand how equity allocation works at WatertightAI?"** (Information gathering)

### My Unique Value Proposition - Why I'm Worth the Investment

#### 1. **Proven Builder with Exit Track Record**
- **Built and sold 3 companies** (perspektiv.ai → Cronos, humain.ai → acquired, Eden Protocol → acquired)
- **At 19, closed Google Belgium** as a customer, personally implementing ML systems into their recruiting pipeline
- **Built 30+ person distributed team** at Eden with volunteers who worked for free because they believed in the vision
- **Delivered 12 FTE automation at Carrefour in year one** (4x their 3-year target) through process discovery

#### 2. **Meta-Learning as Superpower**
- **Fast learner with zero assumptions** - I see not knowing as an advantage because I come without baggage
- **Shipped 6 major product iterations in 24 months** at Eden based on rapid learning cycles
- **100+ production automations delivered** at humain.ai, often building POCs during customer meetings
- **O1 visa recipient** - US government recognized me as "Alien of Extraordinary Ability in Tech"

#### 3. **Field-Tested Problem Solver**
- **On-site at Fortune 500s for months** - embedded at Bekaert (45 countries), Carrefour, European Council
- **24/7 on-call crisis response** - debugged production failures at European Council during high-stakes policy meetings
- **Technical + Business hybrid** - closed 7-figure deals AND wrote the code to deliver them
- **Resourceful AF** - survived on $1/day for 3 months, lived with 45 host families, always found a way

#### 4. **Culture & Team Builder**
- **President of 300+ person student NGO** (Academics for Development) - tripled revenues
- **Built community-first products** - Eden volunteers worked for equity because of culture created
- **Cross-functional leadership** - managed engineers, designers, sales across multiple time zones
- **Student council president** - been building and leading teams since high school

#### 5. **Customer-Obsessed Forward Deployer**
- **50+ production deployments** directly at customer sites
- **48-hour feature cycles** - translated customer requirements to deployed features in 2 days
- **95% placement success** at perspektiv.ai through continuous on-site iteration
- **Multi-environment expertise** - deployed across AWS, GCP, on-prem based on customer needs

#### 6. **Unique Perspective & Network**
- **Global experience** - worked in US, Belgium, worldwide with Up with People
- **Web3 + AI convergence understanding** - Eden Protocol at intersection
- **European + US networks** - can bridge markets for international expansion
- **19-29 age when built companies** - understand younger talent/customer segments

#### 7. **Evidence of Rapid Value Creation**
- **4 weeks to production MVP** at andwho.ai with 5 paying enterprise customers
- **$500K raised with no VC network** for Eden Protocol
- **Accepted to <1% accelerators** - Brickyard, Entrepreneur First
- **Turned COVID crisis into opportunity** - co-founded BloomUp telemedicine during pandemic

### The Bottom Line Value Argument

**"I'm not asking you to bet on potential - I'm offering proven execution. I've built 3 companies, managed 30+ people, delivered for Fortune 500s, and consistently turned ambiguous problems into shipped products. I learn fast, build fast, and most importantly - I've done this before. Multiple times. Successfully."**

**ROI Calculation:**
- If I can apply even 50% of what I did at Carrefour (12 FTE recovery) to WatertightAI's processes, that's 6x annual salary in value
- One enterprise deal closed (based on my track record) = 10-20x annual compensation
- Cultural/team building impact = priceless but measurable in retention and velocity

**"The question isn't whether I can deliver value - it's how quickly we can capture it together."**

### Chris Voss Tactics to Deploy

#### 1. **Tactical Empathy & Labeling**
- "It seems like you're trying to balance building a great team with managing runway..."
- "It sounds like you want someone who can contribute immediately..."
- "It feels like equity is important to align long-term incentives..."

#### 2. **Mirroring** (Repeat last 3 words to get more info)
- Him: "We're thinking about a combination of salary and equity"
- Me: "Salary and equity?" (gets him to elaborate)

#### 3. **Get to "That's Right"** (Not just "Yes")
- Summarize his position until he says "That's right"
- Shows understanding and builds trust before making counter

#### 4. **Anchoring & Range Setting**
- Research shows similar roles at $XXX-$YYY
- "I've seen equity ranges from X% to Y% for this stage and role"
- Start with non-monetary terms (role, responsibilities, title)

#### 5. **The Ackerman Model** (If needed for salary negotiation)
- Start at 65% of target
- Go to 85%, then 95%, then 100%
- Use precise numbers (e.g., $127,500 not $130,000)
- Include non-monetary item at final offer

#### 6. **Master "No"** 
- "Is it ridiculous to think about...?" (Gets them comfortable saying no)
- "Would it be terrible if...?" (Frames as avoiding negative)
- "Are you against the idea of...?" (Softens the ask)
