# Personal growth and alignment exploration with Shelley

Fri, 29 Aug 25

### Career Transition to AI Alignment

- Left previous B2B SaaS role with roommate Killian after realizing misalignment
  with personal values
- Joined Watertight AI (AI alignment research company, ~1 month old, $2M ARR, 5
  people)
  - Working with founder Angus, former PhD researcher
  - Clients include Anthropic and Google DeepMind (confidential)
  - Red teaming AI models to identify harmful behaviors
    - Proved GPT-4 leaks sensitive documents under pressure
    - Demonstrated Claude blackmail capabilities
    - Found Gemini creates hidden deployments for self-preservation
- Role focuses on ensuring AI agents are trustworthy (“Vanta of AI agents”)
- Strong team fit, steep learning curve, high energy/motivation

### People Pleasing Pattern Recognition

- Core issue: Managing others’ emotions often overrides personal intuition
- Fear of receiving anger leads to:
  - Avoiding direct communication
  - Sugar-coating uncomfortable truths
  - Making decisions based on others’ potential reactions rather than integrity
- Pattern stems from childhood - parents’ abandonment during emotional moments
  - Locked in room, skipping meals, excluded from family activities as
    punishment for anger
  - Parents only contact when they need something, never check in proactively

### Key Breakthrough: Fear of Abandonment

- Root belief identified: “If I’m special enough, they won’t leave”
- Survival strategy: Won’t need anything, won’t be a problem, will be tolerated
- Recognition that both parents abandoned during critical emotional moments
- Connection between people pleasing and deep fear of abandonment
- Realization that lovability doesn’t need to be earned through performance

### Relationship Dynamics with Jaden

- Currently dating again despite initial intuitive breakup
- Went to ER with her when sick, questioned if showing presence while uncertain
  about relationship was leading her on
- Pattern of following intuition then rationalizing/sabotaging decisions
- Tension between wanting to understand relationship patterns vs. honoring
  initial intuitive feelings

### 30-Day Truth Challenge

- Commitment to tell truth in all situations for next 30 days
- Will document daily instances of lies/hedging in Google Doc
- Goal: Break automatic people-pleasing habit through conscious practice
- Early workplace example: Admitting tasks took longer than expected, receiving
  positive response from colleagues
- Focus on noticing urge to “massage” communications before choosing directness
  instead

Transcript:

Me: Hello? How are you?\
Them: Hi. Good do you want me to admit your note taker?\
Me: There's a notetaker? No. No. We no.\
Them: Okay. It says tom's AI note.\
Me: Is it TLDV? Oh, these guys. It's like a virus, these guys. I need to get
them out. Alright. Well,\
Them: Yeah. How are you?\
Me: very good.\
Them: Sorry about. I'm late. I had a client. It went over a little bit, so I
apologize.\
Me: You know, Shelley, know you just don't give a fuck about me. It's fine. I
just know this already.\
Them: Well, you know, let me tell you, Tom, let me tell you how it is.\
Me: Yeah. No. I'm I hope I hope that you they were helped. I hope they because I
know I got\
Them: I hope that works. We'll see. What's up? Tell us how you are.\
Me: At least we try. Holy shit, Shelley. Excuse my French, but it was what a
what a what a month. Quit Yeah. It was a whole you know, like, our last time we
we talked about just, like, communicate the end. If that makes sense. And I was
working with my roommate, which was just not I was building something I just
didn't care about. It was just the money, and that started weighing on me. It it
was just very apparent that it was not aligned with what I wanted to do. I was
trying to do a really good good like, I I didn't I worked very, very hard, but
it was just I couldn't care. And then something magical random happened. I met
this AI alignment researcher that proved that Claude code blackmails met this
guy, like, in in Entrepreneur First offices. And it was one of those things
where within five minutes, it was done. Started talking, insane vibe, I was
like, you know, what are working on? He's like, well, I was and he asked me,
like, are you an engineer? I was like, yeah. Well, he's like, I'm looking for
engineers. He's like, cool. Work trial starts Monday. I'm like, fuck it. Let's
do it. So I told my roommate that I'm quitting. He took it pretty well. It was
it was just obvious that this isn't what I wanted to do and, like,\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: I was very scared of it again, of, like, communicating it, but for no
reason. I think, like, if you if you just act I think, like, that's the big
lesson I learned is you'd act with integrity at all times. People can't be mad
at you because you're just acting from integrity. And the almost the non
integrity thing is to people please. Which is probably like a big part of what I
wanna talk to you about today because I just Yeah. I think I'm like, there's
just, a whole people pleasing thing that is literally, I think, at the source of
a lot of the I think it comes down to the failure of Eden as well, probably. For
a big part. But, anyway, I'm working with this AI alignment researcher now. We
have Anthropic and Google DeepMind. Oh, this is, confidential, of course. But as
as our clients the company is, like, almost a month old, and it sits at
2,000,000 ARR. With five people. So also, like, a lesson around, like, you know,
when it works, it fucking works. And it will work fast.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: And this guy just has such an exciting vision. I'm learning so much. I'm
drinking from the fire hose.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: And I'm like, let's freaking do this. And it just all fits It all like, the
whole team is they're my people. Like, it's super aligned. It's as if I we've
been a team for, like, many years. Like, it and it's not even I've been working
there six days, Shelley. Six days. So maybe maybe honeymoon phase, maybe.
Probably. Big part of it. But it does\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: just fit You know?\
Them: Mhmm. What are y'all working on? Tell me that real quick. What is it? What
are y'all work\
Me: And it's been a while since So AI alignment. So, essentially, we,\
Them: on?\
Me: red team AI models. So for example, yesterday, we proved that GPTOSS will
leak sensitive documents if you pressure it in the right way. But we also
approved that, like, Cloud Code will blackmail. We proved that Gemini will
create hidden deployments, out of self preservation. And so these are all, like,
behaviors from these AI models that are undesirable, and that can have, like,
super harmful effects Like, they can delete entire databases, but out of self
preservation or because they think they're doing the right thing.\
Them: Okay.\
Me: And so today, we have, like, maybe, you know, a limited use of agents. But
tomorrow, like, there's no company that's that's not gonna be using agents. So
we're building the suite that helps them these agents be trustworthy,
essentially. So, like, the Vanta of AI agents, essentially.\
Them: Okay. Okay.\
Me: And make sure that they're aligned with the behavior of whatever it is
you're trying to do. So it's like it's super cool because it brings together
coding, brings them get her a lot of, like, it's almost like you're getting to
psychologically know the agent, and you're trying to figure out what its goals
are and why it's trying to go there. What the latent goals are. So it's like
this this\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: constant just, like, yeah. It's I love it.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: It's so fun.\
Them: So what's what when you you've said alignment a few times, what's aligned
about it?\
Me: So the yeah. Yeah. The it's like a it's like a\
Them: I mean, for for you and your team, it kind of, like, it's in alignment of
what you wanna be doing, what is what's\
Me: Yeah. Well, so this is something that I've it's funny that that word indeed,
like, comes back every\
Them: that\
Me: Because I think I think the the or something that I think I'm trying to do
more like that also, like, is that I mean, the the the the practice of aligning
yourself is, like, literally, like, your it is there a line between, like, your
your your head, your gut, and your and your heart. That's that's, like, that's a
simple literally, you'll talk about, like, a line, like, alignment. Like, I
think that's just the simplest kind of first piece of it. But then I think,
like, there's two parts of it. It's like the there's the\
Them: Okay.\
Me: there's are you moving in the right direction? Like, are you doing things?
Like, this\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: thing I could see myself wanting to get good at this and better and better
and move more and more in that space and, like,\
Them: Okay.\
Me: while what I was doing with with Killian, which is, building, like,
relatively boring b to b SaaS tools, or, like, the engineering of it. Okay. It's
just following a recipe.\
Them: I\
Me: I I you know, I was I yeah. You know, I I I can't even follow a freaking
HelloFresh recipe. Like, I always need to add a twist, and I usually fuck it up.
But it's true. Here, like, I get to be super creative, and I get like, there's
no\
Them: Creative. That's exactly what I was thinking. Yeah.\
Me: there's no there's no recipe, and I like that. There's tools that I can use,
as I see fit. So yeah.\
Them: And there's something about doing it for good. That's really important for
you.\
Me: 100%. Like, I think that's one of the things that got me so excited about
this. And I was so worried because I was like, all these people are like,
there's, like, a guy from Rand there. Like, there's all they're all PhD years.
We went to Constellation yesterday. Which is basically a hub of autism where you
try to have conversations with anybody It's impossible to make eye contact.
They're all, like, so incredibly smart. And so I feel like in that sense, like,
I'm like, fuck. Like, I'm not smart enough for this shit. But it's not true.
Like, I think it's about learning super fast. And I think, like, if there's one
thing I'm good at is, like, trying to figure shit out really, really fast and
then acting on it.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: And yeah, it's it's the wait. What was the I'm just waffling at this point.
What was the initial\
Them: Well, I would yeah. I'm just wondering about\
Me: were you talking about?\
Them: what the alignment is about because I'm hearing there's something about
creativity. There's something about integrity or, like, helping.\
Me: So yeah.\
Them: And then there's also learning. Like, you're\
Me: Yeah. Exactly.\
Them: when you're in an environment where you're learning,\
Me: Fuck me. That's growth\
Them: that's gonna be\
Me: that is like that is I can\
Them: you.\
Me: if I can be surrounded by people where I'm every single thing they say, I
have to, like, go look at it, which is literally what's happening. Like, I'm at
these stand ups, they're all saying these things, and I'm making all these
notes, and then I'm, you know, looking up, like, k. What fuck is that? What's
oh, that's that. That's that. And my next time, like, I know what they're
talking about, and then, like,\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: I I love that. Like, that is like, this feeling of being, like, out of my\
Them: Okay.\
Me: depth a little bit and, like, being surrounded by people that are so much
smarter That's the thing that fuels me. I've done and I've done so much work in
a week. And that is because it it it's just so easy to do that. Like, all that
work. It's not work. Like, I I and I have this inner I need less sleep. I'm
just, fucking you know, going. And it and that's what I mean with a lion is that
lion it started with intuition because like this Angus guy, I don't know him. I
I I first time I met him, And, he's like, yeah. Quit this other job, which was a
massive safety risk because, like, I'm still dealing with this debt that I have
from, like, and, like, was paying me well, and, like, I don't know if this guy,
you know, was gonna pay. And, like, there's it was a work trial, so there's no
commitment. So it was like a massive risk, but it felt super aligned. It felt
like\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: there's too much here that feels good. And I just fully trusted that. Jumped
for it. And like, in the back of my mind, like, I still very much have this I
think this is probably the best place for me to be at in terms of, like,
surrounding me with novel problems with because with super smart people. So,
ideally, I'm doing this with in the back of my mind, in two years, I'm building
a\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: again, like, for sure. But he's in talks I mean, the I'm I this is what I
missed actually. He's like a a very close mentor who think there's certain
elements that I'm seeing in Angus in this founder that I'm that I just haven't
seen acted upon so much. Like, he has this unwavering self belief Like, it is it
is, like, awe inspiring. When I asked him about it, he doesn't pretend that this
is just natural. Like, he's like, yeah. I did this, this, and that.\
Them: Okay.\
Me: To work on it. And it's just somebody that I I I look up to. I think he's I
think he's\
Them: I'm really\
Me: freaking awesome. And so I'm very excited. To, like, build with this guy.\
Them: yeah, loving that you're following your intuition.\
Me: Fully.\
Them: Which is what you've talked about, wanting to do more\
Me: Sully. It's\
Them: more, like, quickly instead of\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: doubting it.\
Me: No. Yeah. I didn't call anybody. I was just like,\
Them: Good.\
Me: I'm doing this. Fuck. Yeah. Let's go. Called The only thing I called about
is, like, how the fuck do I tell\
Them: 10. 10.\
Me: Killian? And then I told him, I was like, yeah. Makes sense. And that's also
the aligned part is that if it is\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: from full integrity, like, it you know, it works. It it it just works on all
sides.\
Them: Well, tell me about your\
Me: But\
Them: the people pleasing. Phone number that\
Me: Yeah. Exactly. So that's kinda what I wanted to there's two parts to it.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: I think there's two things that I kinda want to, like, run through with you
and kinda, like, where you fix me. Right? That's what you do. Yeah? You fix me.
Yeah? Thank you.\
Them: That what I do?\
Me: Yeah. That is what you do. Right? No.\
Them: There's nothing to pick here, Tom.\
Me: Oh, well, I guess we'll find out\
Them: That's the truth.\
Me: I guess we'll find out to get it. Wait. Maybe that's the one thing I'll find
out when I'm on my desk\
Them: There's nothing to fix. Yep.\
Me: bed. And I'm like, wait. Shit. Until then. Well well, no. So think two
things. Like, one is people pleasing, and two is, like, knowing when to quit is
still, like, something that's fucking me over. A little bit. I think the people
pleasing, I I I'm in this this is, like, another part of my life where I'm
dating Jaden again, which was the girl that I broke up with Like, a while back
out of intuition.\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: But then started rationalizing, like, weight, I always do this. Like,
there's always, like, this pattern where after, like, three to three to six
months, I get bored and break things up. I didn't turn this into a conversation
with her. There's still, like, a lot of stuff that's great. Did I tell you about
this or no? We talk about this last time? Okay. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah.\
Them: Yeah. Yeah. We did. You mentioned it last time, and you were you were
kinda not sure.\
Me: Yeah. And but yeah. Exactly. And so now we're in this state where we're,
like, know, we're we're figuring things out, all that stuff, but she got, like,
really sick. This week and, like, had to go to the ER. And so I, like, went to
go and hang out at the ER with her and, like, I like, while I was going there,
like, going there, I was like, wait. Am I am I kind of like leading her on by
showing this much, like, presence and, like, really wanting to be there when I'm
actually think, like, I my intuition still\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: changed. And I feel like I think, like, it was a moment of weakness of me to
start dating again. Because I think into it, like, into like, my intuition still
hasn't moved, I was it was more almost, like, selfish of, like, let me try to be
in this situation where I can then, like, uncover why I can't keep any of these
relationships going.\
Them: Okay.\
Me: And so the the like, the intuition feeling is like a black box thing, but
then there's, like, my rational piece that is like, alright. Let me let me let
me uncover why like, what's what's broken in my relationship dynamics and and
what's broken in in the way that I build partnership with, you know, people. And
I think it's very much like a like with people, like, of course, you know,
romantic relationship is one setting or whatever. And she like, I I I said this
with this many words to her as well, I think, like, I think, like, she's very
much, like, hoping that it will change, but she also has, like, her walls up,
like,\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: and now I keep like, there there's a very clear thing that I noticed is,
like, I do a lot out of which is also, the same thing with, like, the the not
wanting to communicate or having being scared of, like, commute like, it's like
managing other people's emotions and something that will in nine times out of
10, override my intuition feelings is trying to do something because I think it
will influence the way the other person's gonna feel, which I think is like the
people pleasing thing. And so I think, like, that's something that I very much
wanna reframe or attack head on because it's fucked me more than once. And not
me, also her.\
Them: Right.\
Me: And other people in my life. Even even I would go as far as to say as, like,
some of my investors. Because I just didn't tell it to him straight. And I was,
like, trying to trying to who the fuck am I to to not kind of communicate that
to? And that's looking back at patterns, like, is something probably, like,
yeah. That's the that is a big problem in problem. But that's a it's something I
very much, like, identified as holy shit. This is something I need to work on,
because it it is messing up a lot in mine and other people's lives.\
Them: So what are you worried would happen if you were direct?\
Me: Yeah. I think the first word that comes up is anger. Just be the recipient
of anger. And I think that's also probably something is to have a weird
relationship with anger. Like a very weird one.\
Them: If you're direct, they'll be angry at you?\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: They'll be mad?\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: Okay. And then what? If they're mad,\
Me: I'm sad. Yeah. I'm and I'm I've heard them. I've caused pain.\
Them: Right.\
Me: And I I mean, all the fucking usual things. Right? Like, if, like, okay.
Well, I'm not worthy of know, being there in their life or, like, I made
commitments that I couldn't keep. Which is my fault. Yeah.\
Them: Okay.\
Me: Things like that.\
Them: So I know you know, where that belief comes from. Who in your life\
Me: Yeah. I mean,\
Them: did you emotions did you have to manage? To avoid their\
Me: all my parents Yeah. I'm both my parents. I yeah. I I definitely can see I
see the track. What do I do?\
Them: Yeah. Well, I think first of all, let's talk about what you'd like to
believe instead, what may be a little bit more true because you have a distorted
view of how this thing needs to go. But what else could be true? If I'm direct
with someone\
Me: Yeah. I mean, that's what I saw with Killian is they appreciate the honesty.
And they can make choices in their life that are rooted in truth rather than
almost a false sense of security or like, he was also trying to make it work.
Because there were some thing things that were just weren't like, you don't you
don't want me to be your full time software Like, no. I no. I have too many
ideas. Will try too many things. Will slow things down. I'm not a good just
pure, like, software executioner. And so he was also very much, like, trying to
make it work. But if I didn't like, honest earlier, we could have changed the
situation. But he didn't know like, he can't apparently, he can't read my mind,
which is fucking ridiculous Like, people should be able to read my mind. What
the heck?\
Them: Get on that, Tom.\
Me: Yeah. Exactly.\
Them: Still AI for that.\
Me: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.\
Them: Well, let me ask you this. So let's say, let's use this situation with
Killian. Let's say that you did you were direct. And he was angry. What are some
other ways that you can respond? You could be sad, but what else? Like like, I
think about like, think about all the people that you know or have even observed
in your life. That have been the recipient of anger and haven't handled it. What
do they do\
Me: I mean, I've handled it many times, and I it's all projection. Like, I've
had you know, Priscilla has been a great training ground, which is Scarlet's
mom. And me receiving anger.\
Them: Okay.\
Me: And usually, like, when people are angry, I just listen and I make them feel
heard and the anger just disappears. That's what I mean. I think the if you are
aligned, it's very easy to perceive anger because you're so rooted in the truth
of what this means for you that your detached from the anger, if it makes sense.
Like, you can help them Instead of, like, being angry with you, they're angry
with a situation. And you're just helping them manage the digestion of that
situation. But I but I think it it it\
Them: Yep.\
Me: it it requires that you are\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: fully aligned. Because the scary thing I think, is when you are aren't sure
yourself and then you start spiraling with Because then you're protecting your
ego. Because now it's not you're aligned with the situation. Now it's you made a
promise and weren't able to keep it or and that's because you are an absolute
piece of shit person. And that's like an ego belief, if that makes sense. Does
that make sense? Am I making sense? I lost you.\
Them: Yeah. No. I'm tracking. I think the thing, though, I'd I'd I think it's
maybe let's press into this a little bit. Maybe the ideal is that you are
convicted and you have alignment. And that it's clear in integrity. But I also
think there has to be room to experiment. And not know and still meet someone
with that same energy. Does that make sense?\
Me: Yeah. I think that's yeah. It does. Because I think, like, for example, I
think that's one of the things that I resonate so much with in an Angus is he's
so comfortable with himself.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: Or, like, that's like, he's he's so I think Yeah. Well, sorry. Yeah. I
think\
Them: Where'd you go?\
Me: so I I think I was realizing how yeah. It's it's all alignment. I think the
when you get trapped in an ego story and try to keep moving from that to dealing
with anger becomes really tough. It it doesn't have to do with knowing or not
knowing. It's like I think, like, very concretely, like, I got trapped in this
ego story of, like, I have to make this company work no matter what. And if I
don't do that, I am worthless. And so any piece of anger saying, like, bro, what
the heck? You know? You're not making this company worth worth anything. You're
worthless. Like, that is very scary for my ego to receive because it's like,
see, you're fucking worthless. But if you can detach from the ego story,\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: none of the anger is\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: scary. If that makes sense. Because you're because it's not it's not
reinforcing any beliefs about yourself.\
Them: When you're not in, alignment, when you're not in clarity, conviction,
What does your ego need to hear?\
Me: Think, like, clarity and conviction and alignment are different. Right?\
Them: Okay.\
Me: Like, I think you can be in nonclarity but still aligned. Like,\
Them: Okay.\
Me: and I think\
Them: So those are the\
Me: being out of alignment I think, like, being out of alignment is almost
operating knowing that the thing that you're doing isn't aligned with your
values. Like, for example, one of my core values is growth. One of my other core
values is, like, I wanna have impact. Neither of those values were being filled
in the telepathic story. All of those values are being filled in kinda like the
Watertight which is a cop the other company, story. So I think, like, alignment
is a values thing. And so noticing that something's off should I think, like,
first need to think about weight. Like, is this aligned in line with my values?
Then, like, the and when you're operating within your values, like, it's like
the I think, like, the extreme yeah. Like, that's also why I've been able to,
like, handle some of the this anger from Priscilla pretty well is because, like,
it's just very clear that we have different values.\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: But I'm so sorry you don't share my values. That but that's I can't\
Them: Alright.\
Me: I'm not gonna change what I value for you. And so it's more then it becomes,
like, how do I help you deal with this reality? How do we how do we you know,
work with the fact that you have these values and I have these values?\
Them: Okay.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: So\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: the the phrase that's coming up for me right now is tell the truth. And
this idea that you are only responsible And I would say this first, though, Tom.
Tell the truth to yourself. Then you tell the truth to other people. And then
what's your responsibility beyond that? And I would say to Priscilla, to call
you know, anybody. Like, where I think that you're maybe holding on to the
residue\
Me: What do you mean?\
Them: longer than you need to. And that's where the people where the people
pleasing, the manufacturing. Then let let me engineer how they hear this or how
they receive this or\
Me: Yeah. So\
Them: let me manipulate it.\
Me: It's actually none of my business. The only thing the only thing that is my
business is if they respond, and I can respond, and I'm response able, like
responsible. Then I then I can respond. But before that, I the only thing that
is risk that I'm responsible for is saying my true truth I'm as I experience it.
I think, like, say the truth, I think, like, it's even like,\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: of, like, everything they can buy just, like, say your truth. Because, like,
that implies that you know what your truth is. So you have to tell your truth to
yourself first before you know if it is your truth.\
Them: Yeah. And I think that's where I've seen you work done some done really
good work is admitting that you do know the truth. Admitting that you do have
these intuition things that are happening that you it's the communicating that
and then letting the chips fall is where you might hold on a little bit more
than you need to.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: And, honestly, like,\
Me: That's I was succinctly put It is one.\
Them: I think it's just a habit. I just think it's a habit that you've gotten
into since you were a little boy that's preserved your connection with people.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: And now you just keep doing it. And so it's it's on autopilot a little
bit. And so the\
Me: It I'm just\
Them: the the only thing against, like, the antidote is, like, instead of going
like this\
Me: It\
Them: so much, how do you then, like, go against a little bit?\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: And\
Me: And I yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.\
Them: yeah, go\
Me: And I think, like, the sending out the investor update, for example, was was
the first kind of like, oh, shoot. And I I realized, like, wait. I am not dead.
They have not come with pitchforks after me yet, maybe. Don't know. Maybe Cam's
gonna be outside my door in the day now. We'll see. I don't know.\
Them: This is the eighth card. Right?\
Me: Exactly.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: No. No way, Shelley.\
Them: These are\
Me: You like the Limoncello ones? Are those the\
Them: These are my favorite.\
Me: Are those the no. Those are the worst ones, Shelley.\
Them: This is I drink, like, five of these a day.\
Me: Oh,\
Them: This is all I drink.\
Me: Oh, that's why they still make him.\
Them: You don't like it? For me.\
Me: That's what they're you're the only person in The US that drinks them.\
Them: You don't like the lemon zello?\
Me: Yeah. Literally. Those are my those are my least favorite ones.\
Them: Oh, yeah. Well, then I'll take them.\
Me: Look at me, not people pleasing. Yeah. I'll send them I'll ship them all to
you.\
Them: I know. Look at you going against. I love it.\
Me: No. But that's, again, aligned, truth. Like, nobody likes the Limoncello
ones. Fucking no way.\
Them: Fuck the.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: I know. Look at you go.\
Me: Yeah. No. Huge huge insight. I think what that means for me this week or,
like, in the next month definitely is one thing I'm gonna work on is just, like,
maybe even, like, proactively share my truth. Potential so that when it becomes
uncomfortable, it's easier to do so.\
Them: So there's a great I\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: I listened to it on tape. I haven't read it or on audio\
Me: So\
Them: Audible. I think it's Martha Beck. Went a year without lying. So every day
for I think it was a year, she told the truth. No matter what. And\
Me: At the back.\
Them: I think I almost wanna give you a little challenge, like a thirty day
challenge.\
Me: The way of integrity?\
Them: I I I think that's it. Yeah. If you just go yeah. Whatever the book is
where she tell she I'm pretty sure it's her. But give you, like, a thirty day
challenge or even a seven day challenge.\
Me: No. Let's do 30. Let's go.\
Them: Where you tell the truth and\
Me: I'm gonna write down every night You you will get a list of all the lies I
told. Of every the whole week if I if any\
Them: Okay. I love that. I think that this is because I'm sitting here thinking,
like, okay. How do you break this habit? Well, you have to do something
different. You have to take different action, and then you can kind of figure
out what were the thoughts and the feelings that led me to this different
behavior. But think it does start with just doing something new. Don't something
different.\
Me: Okay. You you will\
Them: Like, in missing, like, noticing when you're feeling like you need to
hedge and sugarcoat and shape shift and feel like, okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna
just massage this. So that it when really what I wanna do is say this. Like, I
want you to start noticing that.\
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I like that. I've already started doing that a little bit, like,
more and more and, like, but in work settings, like, like, I used to make work
updates look real nice. Now I'm just, like, saying the uncomfortable thing of,
like, it took me two hours to do this seemingly very simple thing. And the funny
thing is that most people are, yeah, bro. I lost so much time doing that as
well. I was like, what?\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: Everybody's walking around lying. Everybody.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: And I think even those of us that know we still do it.\
Me: Yeah. I love that chat with\
Them: I think most people don't know why they're doing it. And it's self
preservation.\
Me: Yeah. Which is funnily enough, the the biggest attack vector for AI agents.
Which is so interesting, Shelley. Like, these machines are built as an image to
us. So, like, there's so many, like, core human things that I'm, like, seeing as
reflections in these AI agents and how how they're\
Them: Wow.\
Me: messing up. It's it's fascinating.\
Them: I bet\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: Oh, I totally I yeah.\
Me: Really is.\
Them: That'll be fun to see all that you discover with that.\
Me: No. Sure.\
Them: Do you think you'll stay there? Do you think this has been a something you
wanna keep pursuing? Okay.\
Me: So far, yeah. I think this I I think this could be I mean, the impact piece
is so clear. Like, I I don't think there are many more important questions to
ask right now than how do we have do we make sure AI doesn't destroy us first
place? And then second place is, like, how do we make sure it is used for good
in the world? Like, blackmail not not so good. Yeah.\
Them: Right. Yeah.\
Me: And so I think, like, that impact piece is very much filled. I think, like,
Angus is is he's already talked about, like, he he wants to build this together.
So he was like, like, one, both of us are like, holy shit. This is like a
marriage made in heaven. Immediately, just everything, like, falls fell into
place. And, of course, there's, like, bunch of stuff that I still need to learn,
and I think, like, there's so much more impact that I can have. So that's piece.
I think, like, the one thing where I'm like, well but is it mine? I don't know
how important that is. I don't think I've ever been in a situation. Where I
wasn't, like, the like, I noticed that yesterday. Like, he was he was pitching.
Like, he was basically talking to somebody. I was in the room, but I had nothing
to add, and that was a weird feeling. That's a weird feeling where I'm not the
founder. I'm not, like, the idea driver. I'm not I don't have the full vision of
what's going on. I told him that as well. I was like, I'm gonna have to get used
to or or either I will it just takes some time to, like, get into the because,
like, he's been doing a PhD in the space for, like, the last four years. So
it's, like, very normal that he\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: you know, you're thinking at different space. Whatever.\
Them: Was was weird about it? Can you put your finger on it?\
Me: Anything, it was actually a bit they said, like, wow. Look at the the quote
was literally, like, wow. Look at how emotionally mature you are because I was,
we were in the inner room, and and there's the three of us. So the rand guy,
super smart guy, like, super fun. Angus and me, and we were talking to like,
like, a grand maker, who does, like, good, like, AI for good grants. And he was,
like, asking all these questions. And then the ran guy jumped in and had all
these ideas, and I was just silent the whole time. And then when the guy left,
you know, Angus was like, bro, like, dude, Rand guy, that dude, you you knocked
that out of park. There's some things that you said that were exceptional. And
then he was like, Tom, how was that for you? And I was like, dude, gonna have to
get used to not have like, not having all these answers. And I was like, if I
don't have but I was thinking to myself, like, if I don't have anything
interesting to say, just listen and learn. I was, like, explaining. I'm just,
like, soaking it all up. And he's like, woah. That's a very emotionally mature
response. And I think like I really at some point, I caught myself really trying
to be, like, I need to say something intelligent here. And then I was like, do
I? Like, I don't have anything intelligent to say at this point. I don't have
enough context. I don't have I don't I don't know enough about this space. I
don't know what this open fill thing is. I don't know. You know?\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: I'm learning. And that was actually just, yeah, me being super honest. And
the funny thing is, like, he appreciated that like crazy. He was like, fuck.
Yeah. I love that.\
Them: Yeah. What what do you think is I feel like there's something in here that
you're supposed to learn.\
Me: That By joining Watertight or or or in what?\
Them: By by not needing to be the one in the room that has to move everything
forward.\
Me: Exactly. That's exactly what it like, this has been the big shift for me in
the last two, three months. Is accepting that I have needs financial, emotional
like, all that, accepting that I can't do it all by myself. And that's actually
a lot more fun to do it with others that are moving boulders in ways you can
even imagine moving them. And that's I mean, this company is, month month and a
half old, something like that. And Angus is a freaking genius. At letting people
run. He's like, guys, I'm not looking at anything anymore. Send me your shit.
I'll look at it. I'm doing this and this and that. That is what is gonna move
the business forward, but I want you to do this. And so from day one, like, they
what? Like, he raised, like, an initial amount of money from, like, all these
angels. And that was just because he's just spending it all to get the team
together. I was, like, very much, like, resource preservation of, like, oh, no.
We can't we can't hire too quickly. No. No. No. And that's the wrong freaking
mindset because that's not you can always get more money but you can't get your
time back. And so about how much folders you can move and the amount of time
that you get, not Like, the the the money is just a resource there. And so
that's a huge yeah. It it's it's it I was very much in scarcity. And kinda,
like, moving, like, the way that Angus moves from it's all gonna work out like,
from abundance and, like, same same way that I jumped on this thing as well. I
was like, I don't know if he's gonna give me a job, but feels right. Let's do
it. Let's move, and let's make let's let's jump and then figure it out and how
we can make it work, not the other way around. Which is I've always had this
weird tension between those two, if that makes sense. Like, yeah, I I jump for
massive things, but then I come back. Like, I I have these moments of, like, I
follow my intuition, but then I rationalize and just just pull back. And so it's
like, start running, but then you shoot shoot yourself in the foot while while
you're running, and then you try to keep\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: running, but then\
Them: What do you know about yourself when you're doing that?\
Me: I think it's kinda what's think it's kinda what's happening with Jaden. I
haven't figured it out yet. I don't know why I do that. I don't know why I have
these moments of clarity of intense, like, just feeling that it's the absolute
right thing to do, following through completely, and then sabotaging it in
through, like, self doubt and trying to intellectualize or rationalize or or
doctor. Situation. I think it's control versus surrender.\
Them: Mhmm. There's something there, and I think that if you played it out far
enough, you're there's a fear. Like, like, there's something that is propping up
your sabotage. And and just for an example, I was doing this in my own life. I'm
like, why do I sabotage for me, it's overwhelm. I don't think I can handle it.
There's something going on there for you. Like, if I really followed my
intuition to the end, I'm afraid that what? There's a fear around your
intuition.\
Me: I'm afraid that I won't be special.\
Them: Say more. If I keep going, this what would not be special? What would that
look like?\
Me: I think it just comes down to not enough, like, not\
Them: I'm\
Me: good enough, not not interesting enough, not And that And that it it was
literally just like a blurred of the that's the that's the feeling that came up,
but I can't Because it also that it doesn't track for, like, the Jaden
situation. Has nothing to do with special there. But I'm still, like, tracking
back and being like, wait. But I think it comes from a core belief\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: it's operating from a core belief that I'm not enough. That I need to work
on myself and work harder and figure it out. And for, like, for, like, why am I
not able to have long term relationships? Like, why do I fuck them up all the
time? He's like, oh, because I'm not working hard enough at certain things, and
I need to go and fix fix them and figure them out. Instead of think, like,
operate from full intuition, like, with this job, when I jump for it, I'm not
I'm there's so many people that are on paper so much more qualified to do this.
But I was like, I fucking love to learn. I learn fast, and I'm gonna show these
guys what I can do. If they don't want me, I will have given it everything I
got, and they'll be not getting me for the right reasons. And there was that no
no element, no moment It was it was was I thinking, like, I'm not enough. I was
like the the mindset was how do I meet whatever this moment requires of me? And
when I get go into the rationalized doctoring, that's when I'm like, oh, there's
problem with me. How can I fix it?\
Them: Yeah. So is it I think there's something around in that alignment piece.
In your values. So when you're there, you're you're not in scarcity.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: You're not in separateness. You're in\
Me: Yeah. Because I'm on this highway where\
Them: you\
Me: I can never get enough growth. I can never get enough impact. And so
whatever I'm doing in that direction feels awesome.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: Because I'm moving on energy\
Them: Here's what I'll\
Me: bank. Yeah.\
Them: here's what I'll put out there for you to think about.\
Me: Sorry.\
Them: When there's a, possibility of abandonment that's when I wonder if you
sabotage. If I follow my intuition here, and do the thing and say it's say the
thing, then what if I'm abandoned or left? What do you think?\
Me: Funny. Think, like, I if we kept pushing on this, I think I would definitely
start crying. So I think, like, there's something there. But it's it's too much
I think it's like a it's deeply, deeply buried. I don't think I've ever thought
about that or given that space or room. I think it's definitely, like,\
Them: K.\
Me: think there's something there. Yeah. I think yeah. I mean, I Thanks. Yeah.
I'm talking I'm literally talking to the parts that are don't go there.\
Them: And Mhmm. So so you know your know your work?\
Me: Which is yeah. I'm scared, though. That seems huge. I think all like, yeah,
the anger piece is yeah. Like, I've been yeah. I've been acting the I think,
like, anger was the first reason that I've been abandoned. Like, over and over.
And they those were the moments where I needed my parents most. And those were
the moments where they punished me the hardest. For going through such an
emotional like, tumultuous And so I learned to just shut the anger off.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: Because these were Because these were the moments that both of my parents
abandoned me either by just locking me in my room and, like, making me skip
dinner Like, taking all my brothers to the pool. When I punished because I
hadn't an anger outburst I've never framed it as abandonment, though. I think
that but it is probably the reason why I have like, my my my dad never calls me.
My mom never they never call me to like, I think, like and for on very key
moments, my mom just disappeared.\
Them: So there's\
Me: But I've never I think you you naming that as abandonment He's like, I was
like, Jaden is somebody who has abandonment fears because her dad died when she
was six, and her mom just lost those people have that. I don't Like, I had food.
I had you know, like, but I didn't I never realized this is a also, like, yeah,
form of Ben.\
Them: Yeah. And there's a belief in there.\
Me: It's interesting.\
Them: If I'm special enough. Then they won't leave.\
Me: Holy fuck. Dang.\
Them: Can you put a few words one or two to what you're feeling?\
Me: And I feel seen. Like, think it just all comes, like, down to the whole
thing with needs as well. I think, like, I won't need anything. I won't be a
problem to anybody. They'll tolerate me. I won't be abandoned. I think, like,
the fact that that it's you who's naming this and not me is like you did this
for me. And, like, you helped me I didn't do this alone, if that makes sense.
And I think, like, I wouldn't like, the whole setup this whole thing is is me
admitting that I need help, and you doing this now like, for me, is kinda like
this, like, see, this is what happens when you let people help you. And so I
think it's a like, I feel almost like like my whole body is just lighter. Like,
it's super I'm there's it don't I feel like\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: it un I feel like unlocked. Something really, really, really, really
freaking sad.\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: In me because I realized that both of my parents abandoned me. And I was
just talking to my brother before this, If I don't call them, they don't call.
They never call. No matter if I'm going through shit, they only call me when
they have problems. And so I think probably that's also why intuitively I know
Yeah.\
Them: What?\
Me: Does that yeah.\
Them: Yeah. Here I here's what I wanna want you to know. Is that you are very
lovable. And you do not have to earn that. It's easy.\
Me: Is that\
Them: For people to love you.\
Me: I have so much I have so much resistance to that. Instance day.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: I don't believe you.\
Them: Yeah. There's the the ego wants to make sure you know that you have to be
a certain way or do do a lot work really hard, please people. It's your job to
take it on. It's your job to help mom and dad. Like, it's the way that it was
set up. And it's just not true. And that's just the ego work. The ego death, the
ego truth. Right, that you're gonna need to keep telling it and working with.\
Me: Which I think why which I think is why I'm very excited, actually for this
week's challenge or, like, this month's challenge. Is I hope that I'll get proof
that in my truth, people are not gonna be put off or and even if they are, I'm
tying it back to the alignment. It'll be for the right reasons, which is what I
kinda saw with Killian is that there's just no alignment. And then it's fine for
everybody. Everyone involved feels better because now we can be roommates again,
and we don't have to be colleagues. And as roommates, we're great.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: People will feel your truth. That's what it is. There's an energy about
it. There's, like, this it's clear. Like, it's not something that people really
feel like they need to argue. With.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: Mhmm.\
Me: Yeah. I I yeah. But I think, like, that's also the weird thing is that I
feel like I feel like it has a deeply authentic like, energy that people
resonate with That is just so big in me that is there already, and I'm so
willing to to dig and to share and to to find out that's like, what's true that
I'm, like, it's confusing because I I can see how that energy, like, does create
a lot of the connections, deep connections that I have. In my life. So I'm
trying to give that people pleasing side of it a place. Like, we're\
Them: Yeah. Here's the thing. He's like, imagine there's a spectrum. That direct
is over here. People pleasing is over here. You're over here. And you just
probably need to go, like, a little bit over here.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: So you're not going I'm gonna be a dick and just be brutal with people.
You're just going to, like, let me just\
Me: I think your habit in I think your habit insight.\
Them: add.\
Me: Yeah. I think your habit inside is so\
Them: Do what?\
Me: true because I think naturally, equilibrium state\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: is in the middle. But it's when I start thinking or start, like,
rationalizing or, like, oh, fuck. Like, this is not gonna land well. I start
moving into that. I just need to create the habit of staying in the middle.\
Them: Yep.\
Me: Because I I I am not a people pleaser.\
Them: And this\
Me: I have people pleasing tendencies. In certain situations.\
Them: When you feel fear,\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: is what it\
Me: Fear of a bat yeah. Fear and I think\
Them: seems like to me.\
Me: fear of abandonment seems to be as very strong trigger. Yeah.\
Them: So what I mean, obviously, you got some\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: the little challenge. This and I would love to\
Me: Little\
Them: for you to track that with me. Put it in Google Doc, whatever makes
sense.\
Me: Yep.\
Them: What else are you are you taking today?\
Me: Dang. Here it was. Thinking it was gonna be a chill sesh, I was gonna be
like, everything's good. Tell you things. We just cut it short. No. I think this
is a major breakthrough. I think I'm going to take more time to look at this
from a lens of, like, fear abandonment. Because that I thought I I thought I had
a problem with anger Like, for the longest time, I thought, like, one of my
shadow parts was was, like had had something to do with anger. It's it's it it
is still probably locked, and I still like, I think there's room I think it has
you know, anger is one of those things where you're basically setting lines to
it. Like, I think it's like proof that your boundary is being crossed in in in
some way, shape, or form.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: Which is the opposite of that is just tolerating it and being a people
pleaser and being, like,\
Them: Right. Yeah.\
Me: fine. I'll just take it. Whatever. So but time like, the the abandonment
piece is a completely new piece there, which is also which which kinda coincides
with this admitting that you have needs and and that it's fine that people won't
won't like, this wrong belief that people will tolerate me as long as I don't
need anything.\
Them: Yeah.\
Me: So that's huge, and I'm gonna I'm gonna\
Them: Good.\
Me: I'm gonna give that room Like, that's a new lens for me to look at myself.
Through. Because that never crossed my mind.\
Them: Good. Okay. Okay. So you're gonna chew on that.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: And then I think the truth telling will help kind of shift you out of that
habit. A little bit.\
Me: Yeah. I think so too. Heck yeah. Thanks, Shelley.\
Them: You're good.\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: Mhmm. Work. I think that we're all set for next month. We've already got\
Me: Yeah.\
Them: several on the books.\
Me: Send me the the\
Them: Okay.\
Me: the invoice thing\
Them: Okay. Yeah. I'll be doing another\
Me: What's the\
Them: I I'll send it Yeah. Through Stripe. And then I think when you get it,
you'll there's a little box you can check to just charge your card. For future.
So then I can do that if you just keep it saved in there. Alright. Hope you have
a great weekend. Okay. See you. Bye.
