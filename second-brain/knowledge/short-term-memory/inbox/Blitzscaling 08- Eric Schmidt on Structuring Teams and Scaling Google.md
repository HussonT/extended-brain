### As a young manager, you absorb everything

I learned negatively

- reorganise prematurely
- become religions

  

Ask the 5 year question

→ if you cant answer that question, quit

  

→ Focus on running the company for revenue

  

What makes it that I don't make decisions earlier?

  

What was the list that eric smidt gave of things they had to fix?

- All startups are full of energy and no process & they get to the point through sheer force of energy,
- List was
    
    - international sales plan, marketing plan, real accounting, do you understand where your inventory is , ..., development plans, 18 months product plans, ...
    - It was full of very interesting convo;s without deadlines
    
      
    
    ### As incoming CEO I kept in mind → it's their company
    
      
    
    ### It's easy to double it's really hard to quadrupole
    
      
    
    What are the key hacks that worked in really growing
    
    - If you don't understand the subtelity you would think "we just need to grow"
    - Good products are made by small teams with strong leaders
        - debate is to scale when the product's ready
        - You have to have judgement on when to scale
    
      
    
    When you do choose to expand → expand really really fast → needs be replicable
    
    - For example uber, can it scale in france?
        - Peopole love it, govt. hates it→ you need a repeatable approach to scale the app itself but also to manage/negotiate with the Govt.
    
      
    
    What's the heurisitc?
    
    - it is tempting to believe that you have a product before it works
    - Once you have the product that works, then you scale (hack value, then hack growth)
    
      
    
      
    
    ## Hiring
    
    There is a way to systematically hire conositently better people (read how google works)
    
    - Sell the dream → if they react quickly then epic
    - You hire the people who can get it done - the market overvalues experience and undervalues people with strategic & intelectual flexibility
    - The people you hire create the culture
    - You don't hire generic people, you hire people who have gone through some kind of stress or achievement
        - for example CFO's who have gone bankrupt → Boy have they been through the war
        - "What's special about you?"
    - Interviewprocess
        - Pretty involved
        - Had a scoring system → found a bias and we fixed it
    - Hire the Diva's → they're a pain but they're the ones who drive everyone else
    
      
    
    You need ideas that scale so fast
    
    - Machine learning is one of those things
    
      
    
    ## Management
    
    - We're just gonna run it as a group and scale it as fast as possible
    - Sergey, larry & eric had an argument → Eric said, figure something out by noon the next day or I'm going to make a decision → They came up with something much better than any of the previous ideas they had together
    
      
    
    In the blitzscaling what's the role of the CEO
    
    - Manage the chaos
    - Has intelectual & emotional leadership of key stakeholders
    - Organise the world around the engineers
    - Put (non-essential) systems in place
    - What you do is selling the dream → if you can't sell the dream you want be successful
    
      
    
    ## How did you grow managers?
    
    - APM program
        - Largest source of founders in bay area
    
      
    
    ## What are the key things to building game changing things?
    
    - You have to have the right founders from the get go
        - they have to be good
    - You need to have some luck
        - search & ads seemed to become a gold mine → gave the ability to take risk
