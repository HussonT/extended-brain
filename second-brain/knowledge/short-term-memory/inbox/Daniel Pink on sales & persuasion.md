### We’ve gone from Information asymmetry to information parity

The biggest change is information access: seller beware comes from the information asymmetry that a seller has

### To persuade first attune

Take somebody’s perspective

- Power & perspective taking have an inverse correlation
    - The more power you have the less you can take someone else’s perspectives
- Have an empty chair for the most important person that’s not here (the customer)
- Focus on the thoughts before focussing on the feelings
- Use emotions as a signal to build a set of hypotheses and test those hypotheses

### Serve your audience

- The best way to be a better seller is to be a decent human being
- make it personal & make it purposeful (
    - Personal: put a human face on it - think about how it’s going to improve a single life)
        - Radiologist story
    - Purposeful:

  

### Clarity : make your message count

- We’ve moved from access to curation (of information)
- We’re not problem solvers but problem finders
    - Do you really need a vaccuum clear or do you want clean floors?
        - Tell me about your house instead of let me tell you about this vacuum cleane
    - Use the 5 why’s
    - Be an expert
- What’s the 1% (what’s the top of the pyramid?) - don’t get bogged down in the 99%
- Less is more - don’t get to to confusion → stay with clarity

  

### Getting others to act

- don’t irritate, agitate → irration is with your mouth, agitation is with your ears
    - Ask probing quesitons so people can come up with their own reasons for doing something
- Ask irrational questions
    - Son cleaning his room →
        - On a scale of 1-10 how ready are you to clean your room?
        - Why didn;t you pick a lower number?
            - Starts ennumerating his own reasons for doing something
        - If says 0 → what can we do to get it to 1?
- Help see social proof
    - “others are doing this”
- Make it easy for people to act
    - Build an off-ramp!

  

## Persuasive framing

- Cognitive biases
    - The Loss Frame
        - What do you stand to lose if you don’t do this?
    - The opportunity cost frame
        - If you want me to do this, that means I have to drop this!
    - The Experience Frame
        - Take what you’re selling & put it in the frame of an experience (I use this car and I drove my kids to school - this car is great for that)
    - The Less is more frame
        - More options are paralysing - “more isn’t better, better is better”
    - The Contrast Frame
        - We understand things in relative terms - “it is springtime & I am blind”
        - Compared to what?
    - The blemish frame
        - A small blemish after a long list of positives creates a great contrast
    - The potential frame
        - People overvalue potential & price that in a lot higher
    - The sunk cost frame
        - Sunk cost falacy
    - Anchoring
        - Whatever we hear first shapes our views
