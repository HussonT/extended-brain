1. **The New Rules**: Voss introduces the idea that negotiation is a part of everyday life, not just for high-stakes situations. He challenges traditional negotiation tactics and emphasizes the importance of emotional intelligence and active listening.
2. **Be a Mirror**: This chapter focuses on the skill of mirroring, or subtly mimicking the other person's speech to build rapport and encourage them to open up. It's about creating a safe space for the counterpart to speak and reveal their desires.
3. **Don’t Feel Their Pain, Label It**: Voss discusses the power of labeling emotions. By recognizing and verbalizing the emotions of the other party, a negotiator can diffuse tensions and create a connection, leading to better understanding and cooperation.
4. **Beware “Yes”—Master “No”**: Contrary to popular belief, Voss argues that 'yes' can often be a meaningless or even a deceptive response. He suggests that encouraging the counterpart to say 'no' leads to more honest and productive discussions.
5. **Trigger the Two Words That Immediately Transform Any Negotiation**: Voss highlights the importance of getting the counterpart to say, "That's right." This indicates they feel understood, which is a pivotal moment in any negotiation.
6. **Bend Their Reality**: This chapter explores the concept of anchoring emotions and expectations in negotiations. Voss explains how setting an extreme anchor can make the real objective seem reasonable by comparison.
7. **Create the Illusion of Control**: Voss advises on how to give the counterpart the illusion of control through calibrated questions. This strategy leads them to think they are in charge while you steer the negotiation.
8. **Guarantee Execution**: Here, Voss discusses how to ensure that agreements are actually implemented. He emphasizes the need to identify and work with the decision-makers, and not get misled by those who appear to be in charge but aren't.
9. **Bargain Hard**: This chapter focuses on tactics for bargaining effectively. Voss stresses the importance of being respectful and empathetic, yet firm and clear about your boundaries and needs.
10. **Find the Black Swan**: The final chapter is about uncovering the 'Black Swans', or small pieces of information that have a huge impact on negotiation. Voss emphasizes the importance of paying attention to seemingly insignificant details as they can be crucial to understanding the bigger picture and achieving the best outcome in negotiations.
