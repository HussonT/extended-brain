# How to Get Startup Ideas

November 2012

The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.

The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the founders themselves want, they can actually build, and few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.

## Problems, Not Solutions

Why is it so important to work on a problem you have yourself? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.

I made it myself. In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries online. But galleries didn't want to be online. That's not how the art business works. So why did I spend 6 months working on it? Because I didn't pay attention to users. I invented a model of the world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked from that.

If you don't know who your users are, you don't know what you're building.

## Well

When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making—not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist.

Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.

Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you're making and whose y axis represents how much they want it. If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision companies as holes. Google is an immense crater: hundreds of millions of people use it, and they need it a lot. A startup just starting out can't expect to excavate that much volume. So you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with. You can either dig a hole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow and deep, like a well.

Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type. Lots of people are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners.

Really good startup ideas, on the other hand, tend to have boring, unsexy beginnings. Microsoft's first product was a Basic interpreter for the Altair. That was not a big market, but it was a deep one. Those few thousand Altair owners really, really wanted a Basic interpreter.

## Notifications

How do you recognize when you have a real problem? Look for situations where you think "Why doesn't someone build X? It's so obvious." If you notice a gap in the market, especially one that seems "obvious," it's worth considering. But be careful about the obviousness. Most "obvious" ideas are obvious to everyone, which is why they don't happen.

The danger of an idea that seems obvious is that it might not be good. I suspect a lot of startup ideas seem wrong because they're actually good ideas that look bad. When you first heard about Facebook, did you think "Yes, I finally have a place on the web to waste time"? Probably not.

The fact that a good idea seems obvious in retrospect doesn't mean it's bad. Indeed, you can use the obviousness as a kind of guide. When you look at a successful startup, you think "How did they think of that? Why didn't I think of that?" The second thought especially should give you hope. If you can think of ideas that seem obvious in retrospect, maybe you can think of an idea that seems non-obvious now but will seem obvious in retrospect.

## Organic

The best way to generate startup ideas is to do what hackers do for fun: cook up amusing hacks. When you do this sort of work, you don't set out to solve problems. You tend to work on whatever seems most interesting. Yet if you look at the origins of successful startups, you find they often began when someone built something just because it seemed neat.

Apple got started because Steve Wozniak wanted to build his own computer. Yahoo began when Jerry Yang and David Filo made a directory of links, mainly for their own use. It was only later that they realized this could be a company.

This is the right way to get startup ideas: organically. The most important thing is to be in the right kind of environment—the kind where you work on hard problems, preferably with other people who like to work on hard problems.

## Schlep Blindness

One reason programmers dislike the idea of starting a startup is that they're so used to the abbreviated dev cycles of programming. You're used to seeing a problem, quickly writing some code, and having something working an hour later. Starting a startup is not like that. The timescales are totally different.

There's another reason you might not notice ideas: something I call schlep blindness. Schlep was originally a Yiddish word meaning "to drag or pull," but it has come to mean any kind of tedious work. And what I call schlep blindness is the unconscious tendency to avoid ideas that involve schlep.

The most dangerous thing is that schlep blindness prevents you from seeing ideas, not just acting on them. Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schlep.

## Recipes

So if you want to find startup ideas, take a couple steps back. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.

This is not only possible, it's how most of the best startups got started. So the way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.

The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the founders themselves want, they can actually build, and few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.

## Live in the Future

At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process.

So here is the recipe for getting startup ideas: get together with some friends you like to hang out with, develop the habit of working on things that seem neat, and try to understand the most important trends. In time you'll naturally drift toward working on things that are not just neat but transformative.

Don't try to force it, though. Organic startup ideas are the best ones. They tend to be not just good but novel. And since what you're trying to do in a startup is discover something new, that's a substantial advantage.

The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to live in the future, then build what's missing.
