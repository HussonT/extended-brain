# Came in at linkedin & saw the impact of focus

- Wanted to define core so came in and codified
    - mission
    - vision
    - addressable opportunity
    - strategy
    - prioites
    - measurable objectives
    - culture
    - values

  

→ Delineate between mission & vision

→ Mission is measurable & realisable

→ Vision is a dream, true north

  

# Culture → how to get this to scale

- It's the collective personality of a company
- It's key to factor in aspiration → if you're not "walking the walk" constantly you lose credibility
    - when you factor in aspiration, there's room
- values are different
    - values are nested within a culture and help make our day to day decisions
- create clarity because otherwise you get vacuuums and people project their own stuff in those values
- Values are key
    - but if you're not recruiting, onboarding, reviewing performance against it, then it's really not worth the paper its printed on
    - How to grow leadership?
        
        - Make leaders understand the importance of coaching
            - Don't solve all the problems yourself
            - Gets even better when you can make other coach their teams
        - Tactical execution → carve out the time to think proactively
        
          
        
- Don't work for me, work for the mission
- Avoid local maximums
    - when a player focusses on only their "job" → for example a goaly focussing on presenting the other from scoring is a local maximum
    - You need everyone on the team to understand that their job is not just their position but it's about winning the game → broader mission/'goal
    - Difference between missionaries & mercenaries

  

- Manage compassionately
    - Take ownership when people "annoy" you
    - See the perspective from their eyes
    - There's a difference between compassion & empathy
        - empathy is feeling what an other person feels
        - Compassion is seeing the world as the other person sees it which makes you understand why they feel how they feel and do what they do
    - How does compassionate mgmt help scale
        - Coaching helps scale trust
        - when you have deep trust across org → huge competitive advantage as you for example know how people will act within your org
    - One of the most important drivers of an org
        - speed & quality of their decision making
        - when you cultivate trust, you put yourself, as a company, in a decision to make decisions faster
            - No second guessing peoples motives
            - ...

# How did internal communication change?

- Language is connective tissue when growing
- We did an all-hands every other week
    - Today it is broadcast across all stages
    - We walk through everything that
        - works → Celebrate the right momennts & people
        - & doesnt work → Everyone can chip in
- We tried to get everyone to act like owners
    - people talk about the challenges or issues like "we"
    - As a CEO → I always vowed to give everyone the feeling that they can make a difference in the company
- We are the stories we tell ourselves
    - You need to codify & reenforce that
    - For example: a value at linkedin is members first → Everybody from enterprise sales to the janitor live this value

  

# How does hiring change

- Machinery changes → hire recruiters, ...
- What shouldn't change but often does is
    - hiring against culture & values
- How do you manage really smart people?
    - You inspire them to want to take action

# How to deal with complex decision making

- manage compassionately
- do not make a decision before you're ready
    - Although you can't completely take your foot of the accelerator
- admit when you make a mistake → confident vulnerability
- Speed & quality of decisions are the key

  

# Who to hire?

- Very smart people → who learn very fast, almost vertical learning curve
- We all work from our own view of the world → Looking for people who have a willingness to understand other people's views
- Find people I look forward to working with
- Don't leave the pitcher in the game too long
    - Create very clear boundaries as to what to succeed
