# Biohacking Lite

Throughout my life I never paid too much attention to health, exercise, diet or nutrition. I knew that you’re supposed to get some exercise and eat vegetables or something, but it stopped at that (“mom said”-) level of abstraction. I also knew that I can probably get away with some ignorance while I am young, but at some point I was messing with my health-adjusted life expectancy. So about halfway through 2019 I resolved to spend some time studying these topics in greater detail and dip my toes into some biohacking. And now… it’s been a year!
A "subway map" of human metabolism. For the purposes of this post the important parts are the metabolism of the three macronutrients (green: lipids, red: carbohydrates, blue: amino acids), and orange: where the magic happens - oxidative metabolism, including the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain and the ATP Synthase. full detail link.
