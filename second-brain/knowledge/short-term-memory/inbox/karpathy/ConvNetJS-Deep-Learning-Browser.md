# ConvNetJS: Deep Learning in your browser

My summer internship work at Google has turned into a CVPR 2014 Oral titled  “Large-scale Video Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks” (project page). Politically correct, professional, and carefully crafted scientific exposition in the paper and during my oral presentation at CVPR last week is one thing, but I thought this blog might be a nice medium to also give a more informal and personal account of the story behind the paper and how it fits into a larger context.
