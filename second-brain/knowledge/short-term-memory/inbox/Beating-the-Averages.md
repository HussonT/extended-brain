# Beating the Averages

**By Paul Graham | April 2001, rev. April 2003**

## Key Points

### Startup Experience with Lisp
- Graham and Robert Morris started Viaweb, a web-based online store builder, using Lisp
- They believed Lisp would give them a competitive advantage in software development speed

### The Power of Programming Languages
- Programming languages vary in power and abstraction
- Most programmers stick with familiar languages, creating the "Blub Paradox"
- Lisp is considered the most powerful language due to its unique features like macros

### Competitive Advantage
- Using a less common, more powerful language can provide a strategic edge
- Their Viaweb software outperformed competitors by developing features faster
- About 20-25% of their code used Lisp macros to do things other languages couldn't

### The Blub Paradox
- Programmers tend to be satisfied with their current language
- They can't recognize the limitations of their language compared to more powerful ones
- Lisp allows writing "programs that write programs" through macros

### Advice for Startups
- Choose the most powerful language available
- Don't be afraid to use a less mainstream technology
- Look at job listings to understand a competitor's technical capabilities

## Key Quote

> "If you can use any language, which do you use? We chose Lisp."

## Main Insights

The essay argues that programming languages differ significantly in power and that choosing a more powerful language can provide substantial competitive advantages for startups. The "Blub Paradox" explains why most programmers don't recognize these differences - they can only see "up" the power hierarchy, not "down" from more powerful languages they haven't learned.

Graham suggests that Lisp's macro system makes it uniquely powerful by allowing programmers to extend the language itself, essentially writing programs that write programs. This capability gave Viaweb a significant development speed advantage over competitors using less powerful languages.

The essay recommends that startups should choose the most powerful tools available rather than playing it safe with mainstream technologies, as the competitive edge gained from superior tools can be decisive in startup success.
