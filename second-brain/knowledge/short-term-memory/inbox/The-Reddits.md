# The Reddits

*By Paul Graham*  
*March 2024*

## Early Encounters

I met the Reddits before we even started Y Combinator. In fact, they were one of the reasons we started it.

YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society. Steve and Alexis came from the University of Virginia, where they were seniors. They shared a startup idea about ordering fast food on cellphones, which was not feasible at the time.

## Founding Reddit

I was impressed with Steve and Alexis's intelligence and energy. After initially rejecting their first idea, we encouraged them to pivot. I suggested they create a link-sharing platform inspired by Delicious's popular links page.

> They got off at the next station and got on the next train north, and by the end of the day were committed to working on what's now called Reddit.

## Key Characteristics

Reddit emerged with a distinct personality, closely matching its founders. Steve, in particular, brought a "curious, skeptical" approach to the platform. His intellectual curiosity and anti-authoritarian stance shaped the site's core principles.

## Growth and Potential

Despite management challenges over the years, Reddit's fundamental utility made it "almost unkillable." When Steve returned in 2015, the platform's potential became even more apparent.

> Reddit the site is such a fundamentally useful thing that it's almost unkillable.

## Conclusion

The essay highlights Reddit's unique origin story, emphasizing the founders' personalities and the platform's organic growth through user-driven content.
