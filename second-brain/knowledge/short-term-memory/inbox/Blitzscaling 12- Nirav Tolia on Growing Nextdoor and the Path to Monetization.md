# Pivot

Nextdoor started working after a pivot - was pretty hard

  

# Challenge with many current startups

- Using venture money to acquire customers is a wrong way to invest
- if you realise you're in a 100 million dollar market - but you've raised a 100 million and now you need to get to a billion → you start to do a lot of un-natural things
- "We've confused the coolness of an idea with how big it's market potential could be"

  

## Built in a quality control mechanism from the start

- To start a neighborhood - you had to get 9 people on board within the first 14 days → otherwise your neighborhood would become an (inactive) pilot

  

  

### Focus on quality to foster exponential growth after

  

## We did a whole lot of unscalable things in the beginning to look for signal in the noise

→ After, we started thinking about how will we scale this with technology?

→ We got supply to a point where we can test demand

  

## Toothbrush test

→ Do users use it daily? is it a habit ?

  

## Do you have increasing marginal value?

OVer time, nextdoors' neighbourhoods always grow

## Fight like you're right, listen like you're wrong

→ Strong product view but look for if its wrong

  

## Marketplaces are typically more driven by liquidity over product experience

→ you go to buy things where sellers are and you go to sell things where buyers are

→ We increased the density of our people who can respond to queries

# What about revenue?

→ you build user scale → You build usage scale → then you build revenue scale

  

## As you scale, you get more of a grasp on today and get more space to think about next years
