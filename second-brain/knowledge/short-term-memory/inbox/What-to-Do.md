# What to Do

## March 2025

Paul Graham explores the fundamental question: "What should one do?" He proposes two core principles:

1. Help people
2. Take care of the world

Beyond these, Graham suggests a third key principle: **Make good new things**.

## Key Insights

Graham argues that making good new things is the best proof of thinking well. He emphasizes:

- Newness is essential, especially in science and arts
- Creation is more valuable than criticism
- Making something amazing can help people, even unintentionally

## Historical Context

- Wise
- Brave
- Honest
- Temperate

- Serving public interest

## Modern Perspective

Graham suggests a more dynamic approach:
- Take care of people and the world
- Create innovative, meaningful things
- Ensure new creations don't harm people or the environment
