# Superlinear Returns

October 2023

One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear.

Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. "You get out," I heard a thousand times, "what you put in." They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.

It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer.

You can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on.

## What Are Superlinear Returns?

In a linear world, if you had twice the performance, you'd get twice the return. But we don't live in a linear world. In the real world, if you're twice as good as your competitors, you don't just get twice the customers. You might get ten times as many, or a hundred times, or all of them.

Business is full of superlinear returns. The best companies don't just do better than their competitors; they absolutely dominate them. Google doesn't have just a little more search traffic than the next best search engine. It has orders of magnitude more.

## Sources of Superlinearity

Why do superlinear returns happen? Several factors contribute:

### Thresholds
Some results only appear above a certain threshold. If you need to hit 100 to succeed and you hit 99, you get nothing. But if you hit 101, you get everything.

### Exponential Growth
In any field where you can compound returns, small differences in performance can lead to exponentially different outcomes over time.

### Network Effects
In many businesses, the value increases with the number of users. The more users a social network has, the more valuable it becomes to each user.

### Winner-Take-All Markets
In some markets, being the best (or even just the most popular) means taking the entire market.

## Learning and Performance

Learning itself exhibits superlinear returns. The more you know about a field, the easier it becomes to learn new things in that field. Knowledge compounds.

This is why it pays to focus. It's not just that specialization lets you get better at something. In a field where knowledge compounds, specialization leads to exponentially better performance.

## Exponentials

Exponential growth is one of the most important sources of superlinear returns, and yet it's surprisingly hard for people to understand intuitively.

If something grows at 10% per year, it doesn't just get 10% bigger each year. After 10 years it's more than twice as big. After 100 years it's more than 13,000 times as big.

## Working Hard

One of the most important things to understand about superlinear returns is that working hard multiplies the effect of everything else you do. If you're twice as productive, you don't just get twice the results. The results compound.

But there are limits. You can't work 20 hours a day forever. So while working hard is important, working on the right things is even more important.

## Performance vs. Type of Work

The shape of the return curve varies enormously from field to field. In some fields, like entertainment or business, the returns are extremely superlinear. In others, like medicine or law, they're more linear.

If you want to achieve superlinear returns, one of the most important decisions you can make is to choose the right type of work.

## The Acceleration

Technology has accelerated the trend toward superlinear returns. The internet has made it possible for individual creators to reach billions of people. This has made the returns for being good at something more superlinear than ever before.

## How to Get Superlinear Returns

Given the importance of superlinear returns, how do you get them? Here are some strategies:

1. **Choose the right field.** Some fields naturally have more superlinear returns than others.

2. **Be consistent.** Small consistent efforts can compound into large results over time.

3. **Work on your strengths.** You're more likely to achieve superlinear returns in areas where you have natural advantages.

4. **Take risks.** Superlinear returns often come from doing things that might not work.

5. **Be independent-minded.** The biggest opportunities often go unnoticed by the crowd.

## The Power Law

In many fields, returns follow a power law distribution. This means that the top performers don't just do a little better than everyone elseâ€”they do orders of magnitude better.

This is why it's so important to be in the top tier of whatever you do. The difference between being in the top 1% and the top 10% is often much larger than the difference between being in the top 10% and being average.

## Inequality and Superlinear Returns

Superlinear returns are one of the main sources of inequality in the world. They're also one of the main drivers of progress.

This creates a tension. On one hand, superlinear returns drive innovation and progress. On the other hand, they create inequality.

## What This Means for You

If you're ambitious, understanding superlinear returns is crucial. It means:

- The effort you put into becoming really good at something pays off more than linearly.
- It's worth taking risks to get into fields with superlinear returns.
- Once you're in such a field, it pays to go all out.
- Small differences in performance can lead to huge differences in outcomes.

The most important thing is to get yourself into a position where superlinear returns are possible. Then work as hard as you can to take advantage of them.

## Conclusion

Superlinear returns are everywhere once you start looking for them. They're in business, science, art, politics, and almost every other field where performance matters.

Understanding them is important not just for your own success, but for understanding how the world works. The people who understand superlinear returns, and position themselves to benefit from them, are the ones who end up having the most impact on the world.

The key insight is that in a world of superlinear returns, being good isn't enough. You have to be the best, or at least among the best, at what you do. And that means being willing to make the kind of focused effort that most people aren't willing to make.

But the rewards for doing so can be enormous.
