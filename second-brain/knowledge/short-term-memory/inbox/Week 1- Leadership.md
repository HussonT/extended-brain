# Chief Emotions Executive

→ when I have a good day, the business has a good day

→ People are employees because they have a lower level of tolerance for uncertainty

→ Do not go to work if you have a shit mood →

# The Hindsight Window

→ The moment you understand that something "bad" happening to you is actually been the trigger to something good.

→ However much regret you have ini the past ⇒ fear in the future

→ however much gratitude you have for your past ⇒ Will show up as faith in your future

Business Freedom provides a psychometric test that can help you identify which of the 8 Paths might be more natural to you. The test went live this month and is currently BETA testing so this means:

a) You get to do it for free.b) There may be a few errors (you can send them to support@BusinessFreedom.com)c) You will be invited to do it again (for free) when we move out of Beta.d) You should not refer people to the test yet.

Also, as you are doing the test there are some important things to know.

Some of the questions might seem repetitive; this is normal and there is a good reason for it. Trust the process.

Some of the questions might feel difficult or even impossible to answer; just do the best you can and follow your instincts. If you can’t find an answer that feels ‘right’ then pick the one that feels the least ‘wrong’.

When you get your results remember that is a guideline; it does NOT mean that you must follow the guidance provided. The idea here is to see how you feel about the various paths and then, ultimately, set your professional life up so that you get to spend most of your time in passion or in flow-states.

If you have any questions about your test or results, remember that you will have a LIVE call with Eric Edmeades and he will address as many questions then as he can.
