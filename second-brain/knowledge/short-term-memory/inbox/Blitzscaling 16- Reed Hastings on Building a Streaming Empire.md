# What to do for a healthy culture at scale

- Netflix culture deck : [https://jobs.netflix.com/culture](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)
- Point was to deter people that shouldn't join Netflix
- We loved doing productive work with very talented people
    - "Joy of excellence"
    - we got more done with less people → We didnt need to dummy proof anything ⇒ Joy of excellence → Focus on talent destiny
    - We "reward" mediocrity with a generous severance pacakge
        - Every manager needs to argue every year for everyone in their team whether if they were trying to quit, they would change their mind
- If you;re going to run really loose, you need to provide context (not control)
    
    - Context about the problem
        - What are we trying to do, what are the constraints, ...
    - Context about the behaviour = culture
        - We have decision owners, there's almost nothing by consensus - but they all need the right context
    
    ### Context not control
    
    ### Freedom & responsibility
    
      
    
    → Attracts creative people (you can be crreativie software dev, ... ) → You do your best thinking in the shower,...
    

# About Competition

- When attacked, we should retreat to do the core better.

# Financing

- You really want to do the entrepreneurial thing when you've got the idea → The idea should be the driver

First startup reed did

- 20 people do 20K a piece (fools & friends)

Value of having VC's

- Banks will fuck with you but really care about rep with boardmembers → so if you can get VC on there, they'll back off a bit as their long term rep is with them.

  

# What about firing

- Very generous severance package
    - We get a legal release
    - plus managers are really nice people, so they want to be nice
        - A really nice severance package incentives them to do the right thing

  

# What about the prize you guys put out?

- Recommendation engine prize
    - Mostly got us good will from people

# What about content

- AMC, HBO, started on other peoples content then grew some distribution → path for netflix was wel understood

# Once your public

- look at how netflix does stock options

# What does a CEO do?

- in the beginning → you're doing all of it
- As you get to 50 → evolve your management style
- Become increasingly more strategic
- CEO → Big macro decisions, - vision, focus, inspiration → You can't do much of the work.

  

# Maintaining a reservoir of doubts is very important

- Farming for decent → every year everyone gets to answer "if i were ceo I would do this:..."
    - Then I check how confident i am about (not) doing that

# Board of directors

- Focus on the people for sure

# blitz

- Degree of winner takes all depends on how fast you should go & the barriers
    - Network effect business → would even make sense to sell 90% to be the biggest
    - Get to minimum scale → Netflix (there talent density etc is more important)
- Barriers
    
    - For example pricing power, network, ...
    
      
    

## Sportsteam analogy

"We're not a family - but more of a sport-steam - if you play one bad game, you won't get cut. but keep playing bad, and you will. Also an art to being a really well oiled team

  

# Optimise for flexibility

- This requires a long term view
- but balanced with short term efficiency gains (mono culture vs multi culture)
