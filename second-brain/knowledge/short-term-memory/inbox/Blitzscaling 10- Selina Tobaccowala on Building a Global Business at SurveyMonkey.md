# Survey monkey

→ Started it freemium before it was a thing

Scaled it till it was too big and recognized he (as founder) couldnt scale the company → so brought in the CEO

  

## First hires made for scaling

UX engineer

Head of engineering

...

## Quick wins

through A/B testing

  

## What metrics to measure?

Company can get max behind 3-5 main metrics → all the rest are drivers for those metrics

  

→ activity dashboard

→ subscriber count

everything gets multiplied by number of countries

  

For subscription business key metrics are

- free users
- no of free users that become paying users
- Enagement
- How many responses they get
- How many stay with you

  

## Hiring

- Ask behavioural questions → How would you solve this? instead of how did you do this in the past
- Give someone a situation in the future
- Most productive hiring
    - Employee referrals
- Worst channels
    - Career fairs

  

### How to put in management?

- Ideally people who have startup experience but also scale experience
- Do acqui-hires to get entrepreneurial talent
- Hire internally → "Your job is getting bigger"
    - Some people don't like this growth

  

## How to know if you're still growing?

- Do you like people management?
- Are you satisfied with knowing that you're influencing a couple of people?

  

# Build a cadence that the entire business operates on

- Is it quarterly? Yearly? Monthly?
