# Six Principles for Making New Things

*February 2008*

## Key Principles

Paul Graham outlines six principles for creating innovative work:

1. **Find simple solutions**
2. **Address overlooked problems**
3. **Solve problems that actually need solving**
4. **Deliver solutions informally**
5. **Start with a crude version 1**
6. **Iterate rapidly**

## Core Philosophy

Graham describes his approach as:

> "Like a contrarian investment fund, someone following this strategy will almost always be doing things that seem wrong to the average person."

## Why This Works

The strategy is successful because it:
- Reduces competition by focusing on overlooked problems
- Saves effort by avoiding overly complex presentations
- Allows solutions to benefit from iterative improvement

## Examples

Graham cites several personal examples that followed these principles:
- **Viaweb** (web-based software)
- **Y Combinator** (startup funding)
- **Reddit** (content aggregation site)

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Find Simple Solutions
- Complex solutions often indicate over-engineering
- Simple solutions are easier to understand and implement
- Simplicity reduces maintenance burden and user confusion

### 2. Address Overlooked Problems
- Most people focus on obvious problems that are already well-served
- Overlooked problems offer less competition
- These problems often seem "too small" or "not serious enough" to others

### 3. Solve Real Problems
- Ensure the problem actually needs solving
- Avoid solutions looking for problems
- Personal experience with the problem is often a good indicator

### 4. Deliver Informally
- Don't over-polish initial presentations
- Focus on substance over appearance
- Avoid the trap of spending too much time on packaging

### 5. Start Crude
- Version 1 should be functional but basic
- Early users care more about utility than polish
- Perfect is the enemy of done

### 6. Iterate Rapidly
- Quick cycles of improvement based on user feedback
- Allows course correction based on real usage
- Builds momentum through visible progress

## Key Insight

> "Ideas like that are all around you. But you ignore them because they look wrong."

## Strategic Implications

### Why These Principles Work Together
- **Contrarian Approach**: Doing what seems wrong to most people reduces competition
- **Resource Efficiency**: Focusing on simple, overlooked problems requires less initial investment
- **Learning Acceleration**: Rapid iteration provides faster feedback loops
- **Market Timing**: Informal delivery gets you to market faster

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Over-complicating solutions
- Trying to solve problems that don't exist
- Spending too much time polishing before launching
- Ignoring simple but effective approaches because they seem "too easy"

The essay emphasizes that innovative solutions often appear simple or insignificant initially but can ultimately be transformative. The key is recognizing that what looks "wrong" to most people might actually be exactly right.
