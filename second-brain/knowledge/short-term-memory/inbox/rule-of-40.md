# The Rule of 40

## Key Insights

The Rule of 40 states that a healthy SaaS company's **growth rate + profit margin should equal or exceed 40%**. This provides a balanced scorecard between growth and profitability, acknowledging that companies can be healthy while prioritizing either metric.

Formula: `Revenue Growth Rate (%) + EBITDA Margin (%) ≥ 40%`

## When to Apply

- **Evaluating SaaS companies**: Assessing overall health and efficiency
- **Board reporting**: Communicating company performance to investors
- **Strategic planning**: Deciding between growth vs. profitability focus
- **Fundraising**: Demonstrating company health to potential investors
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing performance against industry standards

## Examples

### Scenario A: High Growth, Low Profitability
- 60% YoY revenue growth
- -20% EBITDA margin
- Rule of 40 Score: 40% ✓ (Healthy)

### Scenario B: Moderate Growth, High Profitability
- 15% YoY revenue growth
- 30% EBITDA margin  
- Rule of 40 Score: 45% ✓ (Healthy)

### Scenario C: Low Growth, Low Profitability
- 10% YoY revenue growth
- 15% EBITDA margin
- Rule of 40 Score: 25% ✗ (Unhealthy)

## Caveats & Limitations

- **Stage matters**: Less relevant for very early-stage startups (pre product-market fit)
- **Industry variations**: Different industries may have different healthy thresholds
- **Quality of revenue**: Doesn't account for customer concentration or churn
- **Short-term vs. long-term**: Can incentivize short-term thinking
- **Market conditions**: Economic downturns may temporarily affect the ratio
