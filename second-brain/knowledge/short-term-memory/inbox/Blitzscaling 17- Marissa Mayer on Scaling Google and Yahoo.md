# Background info

- Studied at Stanford
- Was a head teacher assistant, thought a bit
- interviewed at Google and started at google when it was tiny
- Was asked to do some UI work → with background in symbolic systems & psychology

  

# Blitzscaling at Google

- At every order of magnitude you should expect your process to break & reinvent your process
    - very unlikely that the way you got your thing to work really well at 10 people will work at 100 people
- Thinking about how to do hyper growth in terms of users & revenue first & then in terms of the size of the company
    - Eric Schmidt installed a system of "sergei's & larry's" dollars that would allow you to hire people & there was a maximum number of sergeis in circulation
    - created a "black market" within the company that became highly efficient (see 14:00)
- Starting the APM program
    
    - Marissa started a bet that should could train inexperienced PM faster than they could hire experienced ones
    - In the beginning really looked for
        - Someone who could see how technology could make the difference down the road
        - Was somebody who was very inexperienced yet came to be in a leadership role so:
            - needed to be humble & a very good listener
            - being very data driven
            - and being technically apt
    
      
    
    # Key lessons from other CEO's
    
    - Have mentors
    - Good executives confuse themselves when they convince themselves they actually get todo things
        - You don't get to code, you don't get to write, you're not doing the designs ... → You job is defense → Get the stuff that is going to slow the team down out of the way, ...
        - Your job really becomes listening then
        - PB&J = Process Bureaucracy & Jam ⇒ You can flag processes that weren't working & then they were voted up & down
    - Really strong companies have very strong cultures
        - It's really hard to change a culture → so be careful
    - Decisions in a week: Good decision today is better than a perfect decision tomorrow
    
    # Hiring
    
    - Make the level of scrutiny high enough → know why you're hiring somebody and make sure to be able to justify it to others
    
      
    
    # Things you do for yourself
    
    - be really passionate about what you're working on
    - Find your rhythm → 8 hours is what some people need, but what do you need? When do you get resentful?
    - Work with the smartest people you can find
    - Do things you don't feel ready to do
