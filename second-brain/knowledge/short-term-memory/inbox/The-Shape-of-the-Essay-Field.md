# The Shape of the Essay Field

## June 2025

An essay has to tell people something they don't already know. There are three different reasons people might not know something, yielding three distinct kinds of essays:

1. **Not Important to Know**: 
   - Example: An essay about a particular car model
   - Adds to readers' understanding of the world
   - Might spark an epiphany for some readers

2. **Reader Limitations**:
   - Readers might not know something because they are:
     a) Inexperienced
     b) Obtuse

### Key Insights

The author argues that "if you're writing for smart people about important things, you're writing for the young." This insight emerges from understanding why readers might lack knowledge.

### The Essay Impact Tradeoff

The impact of an essay is calculated by:
- How much it changes readers' thinking
- The importance of the topic

The author notes there's a natural tradeoff:
- Change thinking a lot about moderately important topics
- Change thinking a little about very important topics

### Personal Reflection

The writer emphasizes that their approach remains unchanged: following curiosity and trying to surprise themselves, not targeting a specific age group.

### Footnote

The author acknowledges that even essays on seemingly unimportant topics can become profound, citing E. B. White's ability to draw deeper wisdom from simple subjects.
