## **Upwork Funding**

## **Upwork vs Fiverr**

One of Upwork’s biggest competitors is Fiverr. But how do the two platforms compare?

Fiverr was founded in 2010. The platform had **3.42 million** active buyers in 2020 (compared to Upwork’s 145,400).

However, Upwork processes more transactions each year. In 2020, Fiverr processed **$699.3 million** worth of transactions, which can be compared to Upwork’s $2.5 billion.

Fiverr’s revenue was **$189.51 million** in 2020. Upwork’s revenue was $373.63 million.

That said, here’s what Upwork’s growth looked like between 2018-2020:

At the same time, Fiverr grew much faster in that same timespan:

Buyers on Fiverr spent an average of **$205** in 2020. Upwork only reports what its core clients spend and that’s $5,000 a year (if all users are taken into consideration, this number could be far lower).

Currently, Upwork trades for $51.16 per share, Fiverr at **$249**.

For the time being, Upwork’s revenue is almost double the amount of Fiverr’s revenue. But Fiverr is growing faster. The question is: will Upwork succeed in positioning itself for enterprises and that way, not compete with Fiverr for most of its users? And will Fiverr succeed in growing past Upwork, while keeping its focus on smaller projects?
