# Having Kids

By Paul Graham, December 2019

Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children. But did I want them now? No.

If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had no fun. And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that, to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they prevailed.

When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically, because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at all. "Better you than me," I was thinking.

Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.

What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded turned out to be wonderful.

So why do people dread having kids? I think it's because they think it will be like the work they do. And in fact, that is the biggest source of the illusion that kids are a lot of work: they are a lot of work, in the sense that caring for them takes a lot of time. But it's not like other kinds of work. It's more like a hobby that has completely taken over your life.

And that's why parents are genuinely happy. Their lives have been taken over by something more important than whatever they were doing before, and something that gives them an immediate and enduring source of happiness.

I know having kids doesn't work out for everyone. Some people shouldn't have kids, just as some people shouldn't get married, or shouldn't become doctors. But for the great majority of people, having kids will be the most important and rewarding thing they do.

When I see parents with young children now, I see something I missed before: how much the parents are enjoying themselves. Sure, they look tired. But underneath the tiredness there's a kind of satisfaction I didn't notice before I became a parent myself.

There's something about the experience of having kids that you can't understand unless you've done it. It's not that it makes you a better person, exactly. It's more that it makes you understand what you're here for.

Before I had kids, I always felt like I was preparing for my life to start. Now I know it has started.
