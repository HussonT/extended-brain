# The Fundamentals of Abundance

- What are your beliefs about abundance?
    
    I guess I grew up without really believing in it - believing that it all had to come from me, that it can be a struggle to get all of it done,
    
    However today I do really believe that money will be avaialbel whenever I need it
    
    I believe that if i can make myself valuable to society, that will pay off in the longrun
    
      
    
- Where did your beliefs come from?
    
    Defenitely my mom & my grandma - my mom had trouble managing her money early on and weapenised us against our dad to get these things done.
    
    a lot of the beliefs can be reduced to: we’re not going to have enough or we always need more …
    
    Elon musk & just growing up in a startup mindset
    

What are the empowering beliefs you want to adopt?

- Money is available whenever I need it - it shrinks & grows proportional to the vision I have for life
- Means goals < Purpose goals
- We’re all part of this abundant world anyway that gives U& Takes and provides cycles

# The 9 rules of the mind

- What is expected tends to be realized.
    - If I’m honest, I am expecting a bit of failure w Eden - I should really work to change that. So instead of saying im professional at getting rejected I’m going to say that I’m a professional at succeeding. People can’t wait to help me.
- Imagination is more powerful than knowledge.
    - Again important to take some time to write the vivid vision tomorrow.
- Imagination is more powerful than logic.
    - Will finish my vision board tomorrow.
- Your mind always does what it thinks you want it to do.
- Your mind works to move you from pain to pleasure.
    - I have to unlink asking for help to pain.
- Your mind responds to the pictures in your head and the words you say to yourself.
    - I am a world class entrepreneur. If I’m honest I don’t think of myself in that way yet.
- Your mind learns by repetition.
    
- Your mind loves what is familiar.
    - I am accostumed to success.
- We make our beliefs and our beliefs make us.
    - I believe that I can do this - be an amazing entrepreneur - i am expecting to be a a millionaire, everyone around me expects it
