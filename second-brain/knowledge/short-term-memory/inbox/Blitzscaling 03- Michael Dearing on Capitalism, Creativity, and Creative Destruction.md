# McCallum's key questions on general entrepreneurship

  

![[Screenshot_2021-06-08_at_05.40.18.png]]

  

# Cross checks - when to not do a startup

- Devils Advocate → Somebody smart trying to destroy my ideas
- Let's do a pre-mortum → What did we fail on?

  

# Competition

- Never a product
- but more what's the substitute → Doing nothing or hacking in your life → Do thing about other startups → not big companies

  

## Am I good founder or not?

- Insight → product → company/business (very different sets of pursuits)
- Be a generalist → be drawn to the problems that none else wants to solve

  

## Good founders cognitive distortions

- [https://www.harrisonmetal.com/](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/)
    
    - Black & White thinking → Decision speed
    
      
    

## Good hiring

- Don't come with a "shopping list"
- how much generalist are they
- How much can they pick up something new that you don't expect
- Also →
- Tell me about a time when you ...
    
    - Faced a horrible dissapointment
    - greatest victory
    - realised you were different
    - Go back and talk to people about their lives
    
      
    

## What is the importance & when G2M

- You need to have a hypothesis about it

  

## What can you safely ignore at the early stage

- board of directors → however the accountability is crucial, a board could have that effect
- hiring executives
- knowledbge about ad campaigns
- detailed analytics dashboards
- planning brand
- scaled customer service
- PR → It's a lie that startups need high profile
    - If you attract people through PR, those are the wrong people because most of the time you will not be written about

  

## What about getting money

- People want ownership → add value to that ownership & then sell the ownership
- Get shareholders who are tied to the mast with you → Ownership is key
    - You don't get that with debt or other asset claiming law things
    - Don't do convertible debt with no valuation
    - [https://www.seriesseed.com/](https://www.seriesseed.com/) → is what Michael uses
    - What does this alliance look like?
    - You need a lead investor who's in the foxhole with you → being able to do your next side of financing
    - What motivates the investor? → usually between 20-30 % if "back of napkin" still
