# The Origins of Wokeness

## Introduction

Paul Graham's essay explores the historical development of "wokeness" as a social phenomenon, tracing its origins and evolution from the late 1980s through the early 2020s.

## Key Observations

### Origins in Academia

Graham argues that wokeness emerged primarily in humanities and social science departments in universities during the 1980s. As 1960s student protesters became professors, they began to inject political perspectives into academic disciplines.

### Characteristics of Wokeness

The essay describes wokeness as:
- An "aggressively performative focus on social justice"
- A form of moral enforcement with rapidly changing rules
- A quasi-religious ideology focused on identifying and punishing "improprieties"

### Phases of Development

1. First Wave (Late 1980s-1990s):
   - Focused on sexism, racism, and homophobia
   - Primarily driven by academics

2. Second Wave (Early 2010s-2020):
   - Amplified by social media
   - More virulent and widespread
   - Driven by "cancel culture"
   - Expanded to include more types of perceived discrimination

## Decline and Future Prevention

Graham suggests managing future outbreaks by:
- Treating wokeness like a religion (with appropriate boundaries)
- Maintaining a bias against defining new forms of "heresy"
- Requiring proof of actual harm before restricting speech

## Conclusion

The essay views wokeness as a cyclical phenomenon rooted in human tendencies toward moral enforcement, suggesting vigilance is necessary to prevent future extreme manifestations.
