- It's really a long & difficult road to go ahead once you start.
- Execution is more important than idea alone which seems very true to me.
- Focus more on active customers who is using it and delight them for a long run retention.
- For more ideas, pay attention to other people.
- Don't take metrics very easy & lightly and most of the bigger decisions are taken from there only.
- Keep iterating your product as quickly as possible.
- Keep an eagle eye on competitors & market to act quickly and efficiently.
