# The Right Kind of Stubborn

## Introduction

Paul Graham explores the critical difference between persistence and obstinacy in this essay. He argues that while both involve not giving up, they are fundamentally different approaches to problem-solving.

## Key Distinctions

### Persistent vs. Obstinate Behavior

Graham notes that successful people are persistent, but not obstinate. As he describes:

> Successful people tend to be persistent. New ideas often don't work at first, but they're not deterred.

The key differences include:

- Persistent people listen and adapt
- Obstinate people resist changing their ideas
- Persistent individuals are driven by a goal
- Obstinate people are attached to their initial methods

## The Components of Persistence

Graham identifies five crucial qualities of persistence:

1. Energy
2. Imagination
3. Resilience
4. Good judgment
5. Focus on a specific goal

## Conclusion

The essay concludes that the "right kind of stubbornness" is rare but powerful. As Graham states:

> Whereas very few people have enough of all five of the qualities that produce the right kind of stubbornness, but when they do the results are magical.

## Acknowledgments

Graham thanks several individuals for reading drafts of the essay, including Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and others.
