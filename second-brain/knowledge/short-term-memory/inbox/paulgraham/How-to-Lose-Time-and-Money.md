| ![How to Lose Time and Money ](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-lose-time-and-money-2.gif)<br>July 2010<br>When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money. I<br>now had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before:<br>how not to lose it. I knew it was possible to go from rich to<br>poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich. But while<br>I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from<br>[poor to rich](https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html), <br>I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich<br>to poor. Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they<br>were.<br>So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you'd<br>asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by<br>spending all their money. That's how it happens in books and movies,<br>because that's the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most<br>fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through<br>bad investments.<br>It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary<br>tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of<br>thousands of dollars without thinking "wow, I'm spending a lot of<br>money." Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a<br>million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an<br>eye.<br>In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms<br>that making investments doesn't. Luxuries seem self-indulgent.<br>And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,<br>you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads<br>to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You're not spending<br>the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another. Which<br>is why people trying to sell you expensive things say "it's an<br>investment."<br>The solution is to develop new alarms. This can be a tricky business,<br>because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so<br>basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you<br>from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes<br>fairly counterintuitive.<br>A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with<br>time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous way to<br>lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake<br>work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're being<br>self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke<br>up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd<br>feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it<br>makes me wince. I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on<br>a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.<br>And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in<br>front of a TV all day â€” days at the end of which, if I asked myself<br>what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,<br>nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad<br>as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If<br>I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into<br>perdition. But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get<br>nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially,<br>like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do it sitting<br>at a desk. It's not fun. So it must be work.<br>With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to<br>protect you. It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,<br>and perhaps all pre-industrial societies. So nature and nurture<br>combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten<br>more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors<br>that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more<br>virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.<br>**Thanks** to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica<br>Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. |
