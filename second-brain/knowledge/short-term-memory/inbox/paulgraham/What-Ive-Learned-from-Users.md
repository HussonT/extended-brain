| ![Alien Truth](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/alien-truth-4.gif)<br>October 2022<br>If there were intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they'd<br>share certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematics<br>would be the same, because they're true by definition. Ditto for<br>the truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same<br>on their planet. But I think we'd share other truths with aliens<br>besides the truths of math and physics, and that it would be<br>worthwhile to think about what these might be.<br>For example, I think we'd share the principle that a controlled<br>experiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionally<br>increased belief in it. It seems fairly likely, too, that it would<br>be true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing.<br>We'd probably share Occam's razor. There doesn't seem anything<br>specifically human about any of these ideas.<br>We can only guess, of course. We can't say for sure what forms<br>intelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that<br>question, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien<br>truth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms<br>intelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or<br>more precisely a target, for truth. If you're trying to find the<br>most general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably<br>they'll be those we'd share in common with other forms of intelligent<br>life.<br>Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side of<br>generosity. If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that's<br>enough. Justice, for example. I wouldn't want to bet that all<br>intelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but I<br>wouldn't want to bet against it either.<br>The idea of alien truth is related to Erdos's idea of God's book.<br>He used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God's<br>book, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was<br>more discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be<br>universally recognized. If there's such a thing as alien truth,<br>then there's more in God's book than math.<br>What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice<br>is "philosophy." Whatever else philosophy includes, it should<br>probably include this. I'm fairly sure Aristotle would have thought<br>so. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth<br>is, if not an accurate description _of_ philosophy, a good<br>definition _for_ it. I.e. that it's what people who call<br>themselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currently<br>are. But I'm not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not what<br>we call it.<br>We may one day have something like alien life among us in the form<br>of AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about what<br>truths an intelligent being would have to share with us. We might<br>find, for example, that it's impossible to create something we'd<br>consider intelligent that doesn't use Occam's razor. We might one<br>day even be able to prove that. But though this sort of research<br>would be very interesting, it's not necessary for our purposes, or<br>even the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we're going to call it that, would be<br>to see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target,<br>not to say precisely where the threshold of it is. Those two questions might one<br>day converge, but they'll converge from quite different directions,<br>and till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselves<br>to thinking only about things we're certain would be alien truths.<br>Especially since this will probably be one of those areas where the<br>best guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let's<br>see if that one does.)<br>Whatever we call it, the attempt to discover alien truths would be<br>a worthwhile undertaking. And curiously enough, that is itself<br>probably an alien truth.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Greg Brockman, <br>Patrick Collison, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this. |
