| ![The Fatal Pinch](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-fatal-pinch-4.gif)<br>December 2014<br>Many startups go through a point a few months before they die where<br>although they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they're<br>also losing a lot each month, and revenue growth is either nonexistent<br>or mediocre. The company has, say, 6 months of runway. Or to put<br>it more brutally, 6 months before they're out of business. They<br>expect to avoid that by raising more from investors.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html#f1n)\]<br>That last sentence is the fatal one.<br>There may be nothing founders are so prone to delude themselves<br>about as how interested investors will be in giving them additional<br>funding. It's hard to convince investors the first time too, but<br>founders expect that. What bites them the second time is a confluence<br>of three forces:<br>1. The company is spending more now than it did the first time<br>    it raised money.<br>   <br>2. Investors have much higher standards for companies that have<br>    already raised money.<br>   <br>3. The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first<br>    time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it<br>    was too early to ask. Now it's possible to ask that question, and<br>    the default answer is failure, because at this point that is the<br>    default outcome.<br>   <br>I'm going to call the situation I described in the first paragraph "the fatal pinch." I try to resist<br>coining phrases, but making up a name for this situation may snap<br>founders into realizing when they're in it.<br>One of the things that makes the fatal pinch so dangerous is<br>that it's self-reinforcing. Founders overestimate their chances<br>of raising more money, and so are slack about reaching<br>profitability, which further decreases their chances of raising<br>money.<br>Now that you know about the fatal pinch, how do you avoid it? YÂ Combinator tells<br>founders who raise money to act as if it's the last they'll ever<br>get. Because the self-reinforcing nature of this situation works<br>the other way too: the less you need further investment, the easier<br>it is to get.<br>What do you do if you're already in the fatal pinch? The<br>first step is to re-evaluate the probability of raising more money.<br>I will now, by an amazing feat of clairvoyance, do this for you:<br>the probability is zero. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html#f2n)\]<br>Three options remain: you can shut down the company, you can increase<br>how much you make, and you can decrease how much you spend.<br>You should shut down the company if you're certain it will<br>fail no matter what you do. Then at least you can give back the<br>money you have left, and save yourself however many months you would<br>have spent riding it down.<br>Companies rarely _have_ to fail though. What I'm really doing<br>here is giving you the option of admitting you've already given up.<br>If you don't want to shut down the company, that leaves increasing<br>revenues and decreasing expenses. In most startups, expenses =<br>people, and decreasing expenses = firing people.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html#f3n)\]<br>Deciding to<br>fire people is usually hard, but there's one case in which it<br>shouldn't be: when there are people you already know you should<br>fire but you're in denial about it. If so, now's the time.<br>If that makes you profitable, or will enable you to make it to<br>profitability on the money you have left, you've avoided the immediate<br>danger.<br>Otherwise you have three options: you either have to fire good<br>people, get some or all of the employees to take less salary for a<br>while, or increase revenues.<br>Getting people to take less salary is a weak solution that will<br>only work when the problem isn't too bad. If your current trajectory<br>won't quite get you to profitability but you can get over the threshold<br>by cutting salaries a little,<br>you might be able to make the case to everyone for doing it.<br>Otherwise you're probably just postponing the problem, and that<br>will be obvious to the people whose salaries you're proposing to<br>cut.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html#f4n)\]<br>Which leaves two options, firing good people and making more money.<br>While trying to balance them, keep in mind the eventual goal: to be<br>a successful product company in the sense of having a single thing<br>lots of people use.<br>You should lean more toward firing people if the source of your<br>trouble is overhiring. If you went out and hired 15 people before<br>you even knew what you were building, you've created a broken<br>company. You need to figure out what you're building, and it will<br>probably be easier to do that with a handful of people than 15.<br>Plus those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whatever<br>you end up building. So the solution may be to shrink and then<br>figure out what direction to grow in. After all, you're not doing<br>those 15 people any favors if you fly the company into ground with<br>them aboard. They'll all lose their jobs eventually, along with<br>all the time they expended on this doomed company.<br>Whereas if you only have a handful of people, it may be better to<br>focus on trying to make more money. It may seem facile to suggest<br>a startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking.<br>Usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell<br>whatever it sells. What I'm suggesting here is not so much to try<br>harder to make money but to try to make money in a different way.<br>For example, if you have only one person selling while the rest are<br>writing code, consider having everyone work on selling. What good<br>will more code do you when you're out of business? <br>If you have to write code to close a certain deal, go ahead;<br>that follows from everyone working on selling. But only work on<br>whatever will get you the most revenue the soonest.<br>Another way to make money differently is to sell different things,<br>and in particular to do more consultingish work. I say consultingish<br>because there is a long slippery slope from making products to pure<br>consulting, and you don't have to go far down it before you start<br>to offer something really attractive to customers. Although your<br>product may not be very appealing yet, if you're a startup your<br>programmers will often be way better than the ones your customers<br>have. Or you may have expertise in some new field they<br>don't understand. So if you change your sales conversations<br>just a little from "do you want to buy our product?" to "what do<br>you need that you'd pay a lot for?" you may find it's suddenly a<br>lot easier to extract money from customers.<br>Be ruthlessly mercenary when you start doing this, though. You're<br>trying to save your company from death here, so make customers pay<br>a lot, quickly. And to the extent you can, try to avoid the<br>worst pitfalls of consulting. The ideal thing might be if you built<br>a precisely defined derivative version of your product for the<br>customer, and it was otherwise a straight product sale. You keep<br>the IP and no billing by the hour.<br>In the best case, this consultingish work may not be just something<br>you do to survive, but may turn out to be the [thing-that-doesn't-scale](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html) that defines your<br>company. Don't expect it to be, but as you dive into individual<br>users' needs, keep your eyes open for narrow openings that have<br>wide vistas beyond.<br>There is usually so much demand for custom work that unless you're<br>really incompetent there has to be some point down the slope of<br>consulting at which you can survive. But I didn't use the term<br>slippery slope by accident; customers' insatiable demand for custom<br>work will always be pushing you toward the bottom. So while you'll<br>probably survive, the problem now becomes to survive with the least<br>damage and distraction.<br>The good news is, plenty of successful startups have passed through<br>near-death experiences and gone on to flourish. You just have to<br>realize in time that you're near death. And if you're in the fatal pinch,<br>you are.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>There are a handful of companies that can't reasonably expect<br>to make money for the first year or two, because what they're<br>building takes so long. For these companies substitute "progress"<br>for "revenue growth." You're not one of these companies unless<br>your initial investors agreed in advance that you were. And frankly<br>even these companies wish they weren't, because the illiquidity of<br>"progress" puts them at the mercy of investors.<br>\[2\]<br>There's a variant of the fatal pinch where your existing<br>investors help you along by promising to invest more. Or rather,<br>where you read them as promising to invest more, while they think<br>they're just mentioning the possibility. The way to solve this<br>problem, if you have 8 months of runway or less, is to try to get<br>the money right now. Then you'll either get the money, in which<br>case (immediate) problem solved, or at least prevent your investors<br>from helping you to remain in denial about your fundraising prospects.<br>\[3\]<br>Obviously, if you have significant expenses other than salaries<br>that you can eliminate, do it now.<br>\[4\]<br>Unless of course the source of the problem is that you're paying<br>yourselves high salaries. If by cutting the founders' salaries to<br>the minimum you need, you can make it to profitability, you should.<br>But it's a bad sign if you needed to read this to realize that.<br>**Thanks** to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and<br>Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this. |
