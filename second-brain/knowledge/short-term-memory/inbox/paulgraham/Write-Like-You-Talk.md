| ![Write Like You Talk](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/write-like-you-talk-4.gif)<br>October 2015<br>Here's a simple trick for getting more people to read what you<br>write: write in spoken language.<br>Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write<br>in a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a<br>friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.<br>No one uses "pen" as a verb in spoken English. You'd feel like an<br>idiot using "pen" instead of "write" in a conversation with a friend.<br>The last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago:<br>> The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: "After Altamira, all is<br>>  decadence."<br>It's from Neil Oliver's _A History of Ancient Britain_. I feel bad<br>making an example of this book, because it's no worse than lots of<br>others. But just imagine calling Picasso "the mercurial Spaniard" when<br>talking to a friend. Even one<br>sentence of this would raise eyebrows in conversation. And yet<br>people write whole books of it.<br>Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make<br>written language worse?<br>If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes.<br>Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read.<br>It's also more formal and distant, which gives the reader's attention<br>permission to drift. But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences<br>and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that<br>you're saying more than you actually are.<br>You don't need complex sentences to express complex ideas. When<br>specialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas<br>in their field, they don't use sentences any more complex than they<br>do when talking about what to have for lunch. They use different<br>words, certainly. But even those they use no more than necessary.<br>And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally<br>experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove,<br>and partly because the harder the ideas you're talking about, the<br>less you can afford to let language get in the way.<br>Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.<br>I'm not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as much<br>music as text, so you can say things you wouldn't say in conversation.<br>And there are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancy<br>language in prose. And then of course there are cases where writers<br>don't want to make it easy to understand what they're sayingâ€”in<br>corporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the more<br>[bogus](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1,5&q=transgression+narrative+postmodern+gender) end of the humanities. But for nearly everyone else, spoken<br>language is better.<br>It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language.<br>So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way<br>you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask "Is<br>this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?" If it<br>isn't, imagine what you would say, and use that instead. After a<br>while this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write<br>something you wouldn't say, you'll hear the clank as it hits the<br>page.<br>Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything<br>that doesn't sound like conversation. I even fix bits that are<br>phonetically awkward; I don't know if that's necessary, but it<br>doesn't cost much.<br>This trick may not always be enough. I've seen writing so far<br>removed from spoken language that it couldn't be fixed sentence by<br>sentence. For cases like that there's a more drastic solution.<br>After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you<br>just wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.<br>People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking.<br>The fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely people<br>manage to write in spoken language. Otherwise everyone's writing<br>would sound like them talking.<br>If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you'll be ahead<br>of 95% of writers. And it's so easy to do: just don't let a sentence<br>through unless it's the way you'd say it to a friend.<br>**Thanks** to Patrick Collison and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this. |
