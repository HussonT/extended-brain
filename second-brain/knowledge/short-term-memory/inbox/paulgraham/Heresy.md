| ![Heresy](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/heresy-4.gif)<br>April 2022<br>One of the most surprising things I've witnessed in my lifetime is<br>the rebirth of the concept of heresy.<br>In his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about the<br>moment when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College:<br>> Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly<br>>  to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three<br>>  unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage.<br>>  \[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f1n)\]<br>The first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly<br>medieval. How strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But when<br>I reread it 20 years later it sounded like a description of<br>contemporary employment.<br>There are an ever-increasing number of opinions you can be fired<br>for. Those doing the firing don't use the word "heresy" to describe<br>them, but structurally they're equivalent. Structurally there are<br>two distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priority<br>over the question of truth or falsity, and (2) that it outweighs<br>everything else the speaker has done.<br>For example, when someone calls a statement "x-ist," they're also<br>implicitly saying that this is the end of the discussion. They do<br>not, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement is<br>true or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of<br>signalling an exception. That's one of the reasons they're used:<br>to end a discussion.<br>If you find yourself talking to someone who uses these labels a<br>lot, it might be worthwhile to ask them explicitly if they believe<br>any babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. Can a statement<br>be x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is<br>yes, then they're admitting to banning the truth. That's obvious<br>enough that I'd guess most would answer no. But if they answer no,<br>it's easy to show that they're mistaken, and that in practice such<br>labels are applied to statements regardless of their truth or<br>falsity.<br>The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is<br>considered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn't work<br>that way. The same statement can't be true when one person says it,<br>but x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f2n)\]<br>The other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinary<br>opinions, is that the public expression of them outweighs everything<br>else the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like knowledge of<br>history, or taste in music, you're judged by the average of your<br>opinions. A heresy is qualitatively different. It's like dropping<br>a chunk of uranium onto the scale.<br>Back in the day (and still, in some places) the punishment for<br>heresy was death. You could have led a life of exemplary goodness,<br>but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were<br>going to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get<br>fired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the<br>structure of the situation is the same: the heresy<br>outweighs everything else. You could have spent the last ten years<br>saving children's lives, but if you express certain opinions, you're<br>automatically fired.<br>It's much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter how<br>virtuously you've lived, if you commit a crime, you must still<br>suffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless<br>life might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn't affect whether<br>you're guilty or not.<br>A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime —<br>one that makes some people feel not merely that you're mistaken,<br>but that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you<br>punished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an<br>actual crime. There are many on the far left who believe<br>strongly in the reintegration of felons (as I do myself), and yet<br>seem to feel that anyone guilty of certain heresies should never<br>work again.<br>There are always some heresies — some opinions you'd be punished<br>for expressing. But there are a lot more now than there were a few<br>decades ago, and even those who are happy about this would have to<br>agree that it's so.<br>Why? Why has this antiquated-sounding religious concept come back<br>in a secular form? And why now?<br>You need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerant<br>people, and an ideology to guide them. The intolerant people are<br>always there. They exist in every sufficiently large society. That's<br>why waves of intolerance can arise so suddenly; all they need is<br>something to set them off.<br>I've already written an [essay](https://paulgraham.com/conformism.html) <br>describing the aggressively<br>conventional-minded. The short version is that people can be<br>classified in two dimensions according to (1) how independent- or<br>conventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are about<br>it. The aggressively conventional-minded are the enforcers of<br>orthodoxy.<br>Normally they're only locally visible. They're the grumpy, censorious<br>people in a group — the ones who are always first to complain when<br>something violates the current rules of propriety. But occasionally,<br>like a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large number<br>of aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideology<br>all at once. Then they become much more of a problem, because a mob<br>dynamic takes over, where the enthusiasm of each participant is<br>increased by the enthusiasm of the others.<br>The most notorious 20th century case may have been the Cultural<br>Revolution. Though initiated by Mao to undermine his rivals, the<br>Cultural Revolution was otherwise mostly a grass-roots phenomenon.<br>Mao said in essence: There are heretics among us. Seek them out and<br>punish them. And that's all the aggressively conventional-minded<br>ever need to hear. They went at it with the delight of dogs chasing<br>squirrels.<br>To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the<br>features of a religion. In particular it must have strict and<br>arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their <br>[purity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaHLd8de6nM) <br>by obeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these<br>rules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn't.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f3n)\]<br>In the late 1980s a new ideology of this type appeared in US<br>universities. It had a very strong component of moral purity, and<br>the aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usual<br>eagerness — all the more because the relaxation of social norms<br>in the preceding decades meant there had been less and less to<br>forbid. The resulting wave of intolerance has been eerily similar<br>in form to the Cultural Revolution, though fortunately much smaller<br>in magnitude.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f4n)\]<br>I've deliberately avoided mentioning any specific heresies here.<br>Partly because one of the universal tactics of heretic hunters, now<br>as in the past, is to accuse those who disapprove of the way in<br>which they suppress ideas of being heretics themselves. Indeed,<br>this tactic is so consistent that you could use it as a way of<br>detecting witch hunts in any era.<br>And that's the second reason I've avoided mentioning any specific<br>heresies. I want this essay to work in the future, not just now.<br>And unfortunately it probably will. The aggressively conventional-minded<br>will always be among us, looking for things to forbid. All they<br>need is an ideology to tell them what. And it's unlikely the current<br>one will be the last.<br>There are aggressively conventional-minded people on both the right<br>and the left. The reason the current wave of intolerance comes from<br>the left is simply because the new unifying ideology happened to<br>come from the left. The next one might come from the right. Imagine<br>what that would be like.<br>Fortunately in western countries the suppression of heresies is<br>nothing like as bad as it used to be. Though the window of opinions<br>you can express publicly has narrowed in the last decade, it's still<br>much wider than it was a few hundred years ago. The problem is the<br>derivative. Up till about 1985 the window had been growing ever<br>wider. Anyone looking into the future in 1985 would have expected<br>freedom of expression to continue to increase. Instead it has<br>decreased.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f5n)\]<br>The situation is similar to what's happened with infectious diseases<br>like measles. Anyone looking into the future in 2010 would have<br>expected the number of measles cases in the US to continue to<br>decrease. Instead, thanks to anti-vaxxers, it has increased. The<br>absolute number is still not that high. The problem is the derivative.<br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f6n)\]<br>In both cases it's hard to know how much to worry. Is it really<br>dangerous to society as a whole if a handful of extremists refuse<br>to get their kids vaccinated, or shout down speakers at universities?<br>The point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts start<br>to spill over into everyone else's lives. And in both cases that<br>does seem to be happening.<br>So it's probably worth spending some amount of effort on pushing<br>back to keep open the window of free expression. My hope is that<br>this essay will help form social antibodies not just against current<br>efforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy in<br>general. That's the real prize. How do you disable the concept of<br>heresy? Since the Enlightenment, western societies have discovered<br>many techniques for doing that, but there are surely more to be<br>discovered.<br>Overall I'm optimistic. Though the trend in freedom of expression<br>has been bad over the last decade, it's been good over the longer<br>term. And there are signs that the current wave of intolerance is<br>peaking. Independent-minded people I talk to seem more confident<br>than they did a few years ago. On the other side, even some of the<br>[leaders](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html) are starting to wonder if things have <br>gone too far. And popular culture among the young has already moved on. <br>All we have<br>to do is keep pushing back, and the wave collapses. And then we'll<br>be net ahead, because as well as having defeated this wave, we'll<br>also have developed new tactics for resisting the next one.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\] <br>Or more accurately, biographies of Newton, since Westfall wrote<br>two: a long version called _Never at Rest_, and a shorter one called<br>_The Life of Isaac Newton_. Both are great. The short version moves<br>faster, but the long one is full of interesting and often very funny<br>details. This passage is the same in both.<br>\[2\]<br>Another more subtle but equally damning bit of evidence is<br>that claims of x-ism are never qualified. You never hear anyone say<br>that a statement is "probably x-ist" or "almost certainly y-ist."<br>If claims of x-ism were actually claims about truth, you'd expect<br>to see "probably" in front of "x-ist" as often as you see it in<br>front of "fallacious."<br>\[3\] <br>The rules must be strict, but they need not be demanding. So<br>the most effective type of rules are those about superficial matters,<br>like doctrinal minutiae, or the precise words adherents must use.<br>Such rules can be made extremely complicated, and yet don't repel<br>potential converts by requiring significant sacrifice.<br>The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute<br>for virtue. And that in turn is one of the reasons orthodoxy is so<br>attractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet<br>as long as you're orthodox, you're better than everyone who isn't.<br>\[4\] <br>Arguably there were two. The first had died down somewhat by<br>2000, but was followed by a second in the 2010s, probably caused<br>by social media.<br>\[5\] <br>Fortunately most of those trying to suppress ideas today still<br>respect Enlightenment principles enough to pay lip service to them.<br>They know they're not supposed to ban ideas per se, so they have<br>to recast the ideas as causing "harm," which sounds like something<br>that can be banned. The more extreme try to claim speech itself is<br>violence, or even that silence is. But strange as it may sound,<br>such gymnastics are a good sign. We'll know we're really in trouble<br>when they stop bothering to invent pretenses for banning ideas —<br>when, like the medieval church, they say "Damn right we're banning<br>ideas, and in fact here's a list of them."<br>\[6\] <br>People only have the luxury of ignoring the medical consensus<br>about vaccines because vaccines have worked so well. If we didn't<br>have any vaccines at all, the mortality rate would be so high that<br>most current anti-vaxxers would be begging for them. And the situation<br>with freedom of expression is similar. It's only because they live<br>in a world created by the Enlightenment that kids from the suburbs<br>can play at banning ideas.<br>**Thanks** to Marc Andreessen, Chris Best, <br>Trevor Blackwell, Nicholas<br>Christakis, Daniel Gackle, Jonathan Haidt, Claire Lehmann, Jessica<br>Livingston, Greg Lukianoff, Robert Morris, and Garry Tan for reading<br>drafts of this. |
