| ![The Two Kinds of Moderate](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-two-kinds-of-moderate-4.gif)<br>December 2019<br>There are two distinct ways to be politically moderate: on purpose<br>and by accident. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately<br>choosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left.<br>Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they<br>make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and<br>far left are roughly equally wrong.<br>You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the<br>distribution of their opinions. If the far left opinion on some<br>matter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate's<br>opinion on every question will be near 50. Whereas an accidental<br>moderate's opinions will be scattered over a broad range, but will,<br>like those of the intentional moderate, average to about 50.<br>Intentional moderates are similar to those on the far left and the<br>far right in that their opinions are, in a sense, not their own.<br>The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the<br>right, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. You don't get to pick<br>and choose. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from your<br>opinions about sex. And although intentional moderates<br>might seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though<br>in their case the word "positions" might be more accurate) are also<br>acquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left,<br>the intentional moderate must shift with it. Otherwise they stop<br>being moderate.<br>Accidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their own<br>answers, but choose their own questions. They may not care at all<br>about questions that the left and right both think are terribly<br>important. So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental<br>moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and<br>those the left and right care about, and this can<br>sometimes be vanishingly small.<br>It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say "if you're<br>not with us, you're against us," but often simply false.<br>Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by <br>the extreme left. But while it may be accurate to call intentional<br>moderates cowards, openly being an accidental moderate requires the<br>most courage of all, because you get attacked from both right and<br>left, and you don't have the comfort of being an orthodox member<br>of a large group to sustain you.<br>Nearly all the most impressive people I know are accidental moderates.<br>If I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainment<br>business, that might be different. Being on the far left or far<br>right doesn't affect how fast you run or how well you sing. But<br>someone who works with ideas has to be independent-minded to do it<br>well.<br>Or more precisely, you have to be independent-minded about the ideas<br>you work with. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics<br>and still be a good mathematician. In the 20th century, a lot of<br>very smart people were Marxists â€” just no one who was smart about<br>the subjects Marxism involves. But if the ideas you use in your<br>work intersect with the politics of your time, you have two choices:<br>be an accidental moderate, or be mediocre.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\] It's possible in theory for one side to be entirely right and<br>the other to be entirely wrong. Indeed, ideologues must always<br>believe this is the case. But historically it rarely has been.<br>\[2\] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather<br>than despise them as backsliders. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it<br>means that the far right is less ideological than the far left. Or<br>perhaps that they are more confident, or more resigned, or simply<br>more disorganized. I just don't know.<br>\[3\] Having heretical opinions doesn't mean you have to express<br>them openly. It may be<br>[easier to have them](https://paulgraham.com/say.html) if you don't.<br>**Thanks** to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston,<br>Amjad Masad, Ryan Petersen, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this. |
