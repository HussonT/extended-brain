| ![If Lisp is So Great](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/if-lisp-is-so-great-2.gif)<br>May 2003<br>If Lisp is so great, why don't more people use it? I was <br>asked this question by a student in the audience at a <br>talk I gave recently. Not for the first time, either.<br>In languages, as in so many things, there's not much <br>correlation between popularity and quality. Why does <br>John Grisham ( _King of Torts_ sales rank, 44) outsell<br>Jane Austen ( _Pride and Prejudice_ sales rank, 6191)?<br>Would even Grisham claim that it's because he's a better<br>writer?<br>Here's the first sentence of _Pride and Prejudice:_<br>> It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man <br>> in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a<br>> wife.<br>"It is a truth universally acknowledged?" Long words for<br>the first sentence of a love story.<br>Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard. Its syntax, or lack<br>of syntax, makes it look completely [unlike](https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/acl2.lisp?t=1688221954&) <br>the languages<br>most people are used to. Before I learned Lisp, I was afraid<br>of it too. I recently came across a notebook from 1983<br>in which I'd written:<br>> I suppose I should learn Lisp, but it seems so foreign.<br>Fortunately, I was 19 at the time and not too resistant to learning<br>new things. I was so ignorant that learning<br>almost anything meant learning new things.<br>People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not<br>using it. The standard<br>excuse, back when C was the default language, was that Lisp<br>was too slow. Now that Lisp dialects are among<br>the [faster](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/benchmark.php?test=nestedloop&lang=all&sort=cpu)<br>languages available, that excuse has gone away.<br>Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages<br>are more popular.<br>(Beware of such reasoning. It gets you Windows.)<br>Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it's especially<br>so in programming languages. More libraries<br>get written for popular languages, which makes them still<br>more popular. Programs often have to work with existing programs,<br>and this is easier if they're written in the same language,<br>so languages spread from program to program like a virus.<br>And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them <br>more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.<br>Indeed, if programming languages were all more or less equivalent,<br>there would be little justification for using any but the most<br>popular. But they [aren't](https://paulgraham.com/icad.html) all equivalent, not by a long<br>shot. And that's why less popular languages, like Jane Austen's <br>novels, continue to survive at all. When everyone else is reading <br>the latest John Grisham novel, there will always be a few people <br>reading Jane Austen instead. |
