The conclusion being,<br>say, that Ahab in _Moby Dick_ was a Christ-like figure.<br>Oy. So I'm going to try to give the other side of the<br>story: what an essay really is, and how you write one.<br>Or at least, how I write one.<br>**Mods**<br>The most obvious difference between real essays and<br>the things one has to write in school is that real<br>essays are not exclusively about English literature.<br>Certainly schools should teach students how to<br>write. But due to a series of historical accidents<br>the teaching of<br>writing has gotten mixed together with the study<br>of literature. And so all over the country students are<br>writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget<br>might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in<br>fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about<br>symbolism in Dickens.<br>With the result that writing is made to seem boring and<br>pointless. Who cares about symbolism in Dickens?<br>Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay<br>about color or baseball.<br>How did things get this way? To answer that we have to go back<br>almost a thousand years. Around 1100, Europe at last began to<br>catch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once they<br>had the luxury of curiosity they rediscovered<br>what we call "the classics." The effect was rather as if<br>we were visited by beings from another solar system.<br>These earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticated<br>that for the next several centuries the main work of<br>European scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilate<br>what they knew.<br>During this period the study of ancient texts acquired great<br>prestige. It seemed the essence of what scholars did. As<br>European scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important;<br>by 1350<br>someone who wanted to learn about science could find better<br>teachers than Aristotle in his own era. \[1\]<br>But schools change slower than scholarship. In the<br>19th century the study of ancient texts was still the backbone<br>of the curriculum.<br>The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of<br>ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern<br>texts? The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'etre<br>of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that<br>does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.<br>But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.<br>The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that<br>those studying the classics were, if not wasting their<br>time, at least working on problems of minor importance.<br>And so began the study of modern literature. There was a good<br>deal of resistance at first.<br>The first courses in English literature<br>seem to have been offered by the newer colleges, particularly<br>American ones. Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, Amherst,<br>and University College, London<br>taught English literature in the 1820s.<br>But Harvard didn't have a professor of English literature until<br>1876, and Oxford not till 1885. (Oxford had a chair of Chinese before<br>it had one of English.) \[2\]<br>What tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to have<br>been the idea that professors should do research as well<br>as teach. This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and<br>indeed the whole concept of the modern university) was imported<br>from Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning at<br>Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly.<br>Writing was one of the casualties. Colleges had long taught<br>English composition. But how do you do research on composition?<br>The professors who taught math could be required to do original<br>math, the professors who taught history could be required to<br>write scholarly articles about history, but what about the <br>professors who taught rhetoric or composition? What should they<br>do research on? The closest thing seemed to be English literature. \[3\]<br>And so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inherited<br>by English professors. This had two drawbacks:<br>(a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer,<br>any more than an art historian has to be a good painter, and (b)<br>the subject of writing now tends to be literature, since that's<br>what the professor is interested in.<br>High schools imitate universities. The seeds of our miserable<br>high school experiences were sown in 1892, when<br>the National Education Association<br>"formally recommended that literature<br>and composition be unified in the high school course." \[4\]<br>The 'riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English,<br>with the bizarre consequence that high school students now<br>had to write about English literature-- to write, without<br>even realizing it, imitations of whatever<br>English professors had been publishing in their journals a <br>few decades before.<br>It's no wonder if this seems to the<br>student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps<br>removed from real work: the students are imitating English<br>professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are<br>merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what<br>was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.<br>**No Defense**<br>The other big difference between a real essay and the things<br>they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't<br>take a position and then defend it. That principle,<br>like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,<br>turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long<br>forgotten origins.<br>It's often mistakenly believed that<br>medieval universities were mostly seminaries. In fact they<br>were more law schools. And at least in our tradition<br>lawyers are advocates, trained to take<br>either side of an argument and make as good a case for it<br>as they can.<br>Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded<br>early universities. The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing<br>persuasively, was a third of the undergraduate curriculum. \[5\]<br>And after the lecture the most common form<br>of discussion was the disputation. This is at least<br>nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense:<br>most people treat the words thesis<br>and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,<br>a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was<br>the argument by which one defended it.<br>Defending a position may be a necessary evil in a<br>legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth,<br>as I think lawyers would be the first to admit. It's not<br>just that you miss subtleties this way.<br>The real problem is that you can't change the question.<br>And yet this principle is built into the very structure of<br>the things they teach you to write in high school. The topic <br>sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting<br>paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the<br>conclusion-- uh, what is the conclusion? I was never sure<br>about that in high school. It seemed as if we were just<br>supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph,<br>but in different enough words that no one could tell.<br>Why bother?<br>But when you understand the origins<br>of this sort of "essay," you can see where the<br>conclusion comes from. It's the concluding remarks to the <br>jury.<br>Good writing should be convincing, certainly, but it<br>should be convincing because you got the right answers,<br>not because you did a good job of arguing. When I give a <br>draft of an essay to friends, there are two things<br>I want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem <br>unconvincing. The boring bits can usually be fixed by <br>cutting. But I don't try to fix the unconvincing bits by<br>arguing more cleverly. I need to talk the matter over.<br>At the very least I must have explained something badly. In<br>that case, in the course of the conversation I'll be forced<br>to come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can just<br>incorporate in the essay. More often than not I have<br>to change what I was saying as well.<br>But the aim is never to be convincing per se.<br>As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become identical,<br>so if I can convince smart readers I must be near the truth.<br>The sort of writing that attempts to persuade may be<br>a valid (or at least inevitable) form, but it's historically<br>inaccurate to call it an essay. An essay is <br>something else.<br>**Trying**<br>To understand what a real essay is, we have to<br>reach back into history again, though this time not so far.<br>To Michel de Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book of<br>what he called "essais." He was<br>doing something quite different from what lawyers do, and<br>the difference is embodied in the name. _Essayer_ is the French<br>verb meaning "to try"<br>and an _essai_ is an attempt. An essay is something you<br>write to try to figure something out.<br>Figure out what? You don't know yet. And so you can't begin with a<br>thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have<br>one. An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a<br>question. In a real essay, you don't take a position and<br>defend it. You notice a door that's ajar, and you open it and<br>walk in to see what's inside.<br>If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need<br>to write anything, though? Why not just sit and think? Well,<br>there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery. Expressing <br>ideas helps to form them. Indeed, helps is far too weak a<br>word. Most of what ends up in my essays I only<br>thought of when I sat down to write them. That's why I <br>write them.<br>In the things you write in school you are, in theory,<br>merely explaining yourself to the reader.<br>In a real essay you're writing for yourself.<br>You're thinking out loud.<br>But not quite.<br>Just as inviting people over forces you to<br>clean up your apartment, writing something that<br>other people will read forces you to think well. So it<br>does matter to have an audience. The things I've written<br>just for myself are no good.<br>They tend to peter out. When I run into<br>difficulties, I find I conclude with a few vague<br>questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.<br>Many published essays peter out in the same way.<br>Particularly the sort written by the staff writers <br>of newsmagazines. Outside writers tend to supply<br>editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which<br>make a beeline toward a rousing (and<br>foreordained) conclusion. But the staff writers feel<br>obliged to write something "balanced."<br>Since they're writing for a popular magazine, they start with the<br>most radioactively controversial questions, from which-- because<br>they're writing for a popular magazine-- they<br>then proceed to recoil in terror.<br>Abortion, for or against?<br>This group says one thing. That group says<br>another. One thing is certain: the question is a<br>complex one. (But don't get mad at us. We didn't<br>draw any conclusions.)<br>**The River**<br>Questions aren't enough. An essay has to come up with answers.<br>They don't always, of course. Sometimes you start with a<br>promising question and get nowhere. But those you don't <br>publish. Those are like experiments that get inconclusive<br>results. An essay you publish ought to tell the reader <br>something he didn't already know.<br>But _what_ you tell him doesn't matter, so long as <br>it's interesting. I'm sometimes accused of meandering.<br>In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.<br>There you're not concerned with truth. You already<br>know where you're going, and you want to go straight there,<br>blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving<br>your way across swampy ground. But that's not what<br>you're trying to do in an essay. An essay is supposed to<br>be a search for truth. It would be suspicious if it didn't<br>meander.<br>The Meander (aka Menderes) is a river in Turkey.<br>As you might expect, it winds all over the place.<br>But it doesn't do this out of frivolity.<br>The path it has discovered is the most<br>economical route to the sea. \[6\]<br>The river's algorithm is simple. At each step, flow down.<br>For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting. <br>Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.<br>One can't have quite as little foresight as a river. I always<br>know generally what I want to write about.<br>But not the<br>specific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to<br>paragraph I let the ideas take their course.<br>This doesn't always work. Sometimes, like a river,<br>one runs up against a wall. Then I do the same thing the river does:<br>backtrack. At one point in this essay<br>I found that after following a certain thread I ran out<br>of ideas. I had to go back seven paragraphs and start over<br>in another direction.<br>Fundamentally an essay is a train of thought-- but a cleaned-up<br>train of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation.<br>Real thought, like real conversation, is full of false starts.<br>It would be exhausting to read. You need to <br>cut and fill to<br>emphasize the central thread, like an<br>illustrator inking over a pencil drawing. But don't<br>change so much that you lose the spontaneity of the original.<br>Err on the side of the river. An essay is not a reference<br>work. It's not something you read looking for a specific<br>answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it. I'd much<br>rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but<br>interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along<br>a prescribed course.<br>**Surprise**<br>So what's interesting? For me, interesting means surprise.<br>Interfaces, as Geoffrey James has said, should follow the principle of<br>least astonishment. A button that looks like it will make a<br>machine stop should make it stop, not speed up. Essays <br>should do the opposite. Essays should aim for maximum<br>surprise.<br>I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel<br>vicariously. When friends came back from faraway places,<br>it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked<br>what they saw. I really wanted to know. And I found<br>the best way to get information out of them was to ask<br>what surprised them. How was the place different from what<br>they expected? This is an extremely useful question.<br>You can ask it of the most unobservant people, and it will <br>extract information they didn't even know they were<br>recording.<br>Surprises are things that you not only didn't know, but that<br>contradict things you<br>thought you knew. And so they're the most valuable sort of<br>fact you can get. They're like a food that's not merely<br>healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things<br>you've already eaten.<br>How do you find surprises? Well, therein lies half<br>the work of essay writing. (The other half is expressing<br>yourself well.) The trick is to use yourself as a<br>proxy for the reader. You should only write about things<br>you've thought about a lot. And anything you come across<br>that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot,<br>will probably surprise most readers.<br>For example, in a recent <br>[essay](https://paulgraham.com/gh.html) I pointed out that because<br>you can only judge computer programmers by working with<br>them, no one knows who the best programmers are overall.<br>I didn't realize this when I began<br>that essay, and even now I find it kind of weird. That's<br>what you're looking for.<br>So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:<br>a few topics you've thought about a lot, and<br>some ability to ferret out the unexpected.<br>What should you think about? My guess is that it<br>doesn't matter-- that anything can be interesting if you get deeply<br>enough into it. One possible exception might be things<br>that have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them,<br>like working in fast food. In retrospect, was there<br>anything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins?<br>Well, it was interesting how important color was<br>to the customers. Kids a certain age would point into<br>the case and say that they wanted yellow. Did they want <br>French Vanilla or Lemon? They would just look at you <br>blankly. They wanted yellow. And then there was the <br>mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines 'n' Cream <br>was so appealing. (I think now it was the salt.)<br>And the difference in the way fathers and<br>mothers bought ice cream for their kids: the fathers<br>like benevolent kings bestowing largesse, the mothers<br>harried, giving in to pressure.<br>So, yes, there does seem to be some material even in<br>fast food.<br>I didn't notice those things at the time, though. At sixteen<br>I was about as observant as a lump of rock. I can see more now in<br>the fragments of memory I preserve of that age than I could see<br>at the time from having it all happening live, right in front of me.<br>**Observation**<br>So the ability to ferret out the unexpected must not merely be an<br>inborn one. It must be something you can learn.<br>How do you learn it?<br>To some extent it's like learning history.<br>When you first read<br>history, it's just a whirl of names<br>and dates. <br>Nothing seems to stick. But the more you learn, the more hooks you have<br>for new facts to stick onto-- which means<br>you accumulate knowledge at an exponential rate. Once you<br>remember that Normans conquered<br>England in 1066, it will catch your attention when you hear<br>that other Normans conquered southern Italy at about the same time.<br>Which will make you wonder about Normandy, and take note<br>when a third book mentions that Normans<br>were not, like most of what is now<br>called France, tribes that flowed in as the Roman empire collapsed,<br>but Vikings (norman = north man) who arrived<br>four centuries later in 911. Which makes<br>it easier to remember that Dublin was also established by<br>Vikings in the 840s. Etc, etc squared.<br>Collecting surprises is a similar process.<br>The more anomalies you've seen, the more easily you'll notice<br>new ones. Which means, oddly enough, that as you grow older,<br>life should become more and more surprising. When I was a<br>kid, I used to think adults had it all figured out.<br>I had it backwards. Kids are the ones who have it all figured <br>out. They're just mistaken.<br>When it comes to surprises, the rich get richer. But<br>(as with wealth) there<br>may be habits of mind that will help the process along. It's<br>good to have a habit of asking questions, especially questions<br>beginning with Why.<br>But not in the random way that three year<br>olds ask why. There are an infinite number of questions.<br>How do you find the fruitful ones?<br>I find it especially<br>useful to ask why about things that seem wrong.<br>For example, why should there be a connection between<br>humor and misfortune? Why do we find it funny when a<br>character, even one we like, slips on a banana peel?<br>There's a whole essay's worth of surprises there for sure.<br>If you want to notice things that seem wrong, you'll find a<br>degree of skepticism helpful. I take it as an axiom<br>that we're only achieving 1% of what we could.<br>This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our<br>heads as children: that things are the way they are because<br>that is how things have to be.<br>For example, everyone I've talked to while writing this essay <br>felt the same about<br>English classes-- that the whole process seemed pointless.<br>But none of us had the balls at the time to hypothesize that<br>it was, in fact, all a mistake.<br>We all thought there was just something we weren't getting.<br>I have a hunch you want to pay attention not just to things<br>that seem wrong, but things that seem wrong in a humorous way. <br>I'm always pleased when I see someone laugh as they<br>read a draft of an essay. But why should I be? I'm aiming<br>for good ideas. Why should good ideas be funny?<br>The connection may be surprise.<br>Surprises make us laugh, and surprises are what<br>one wants to deliver.<br>I write down things that surprise me in notebooks. I never<br>actually get around to reading them and using<br>what I've written, but I do tend to<br>reproduce the same thoughts later. So the main value<br>of notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in your<br>head.<br>People trying to be cool will find themselves at a disadvantage<br>when collecting surprises. To be surprised is to be mistaken.<br>And the essence of cool, as any fourteen year old could tell<br>you, is _nil admirari._ When you're mistaken, don't<br>dwell on it; just act like nothing's wrong and maybe no one<br>will notice.<br>One of the keys to coolness is to avoid situations where<br>inexperience may make you look foolish. <br>If you want to find surprises you should do the opposite.<br>Study lots of different things,<br>because some of the most interesting surprises are unexpected<br>connections between different fields. For example, <br>jam, bacon, pickles, and cheese, which are among the most pleasing<br>of foods, were all originally intended as methods of preservation.<br>And so were books and paintings.<br>Whatever you study, include history-- but social and economic<br>history, not political history. History seems to me so important<br>that it's misleading to treat it as a mere field of study.<br>Another way to describe it is _all the data we have so far._<br>Among other things, studying history gives one confidence that<br>there are good ideas waiting to be discovered right under our noses.<br>Swords evolved during the Bronze Age out of daggers, which<br>(like their flint predecessors) had a hilt separate from the<br>blade. Because swords are longer<br>the hilts kept breaking off. But it took five hundred years<br>before someone thought of casting hilt and blade as one<br>piece.<br>**Disobedience**<br>Above all, make a habit of paying<br>attention to things you're not supposed to, either because <br>they're " [inappropriate](https://paulgraham.com/say.html)," <br>or not important, or not what you're<br>supposed to be working on. If you're curious about something,<br>trust your instincts.<br>Follow the threads that attract your<br>attention. If there's something you're really interested<br>in, you'll find they have an uncanny way of leading back to<br>it anyway, just as the conversation of people who are especially<br>proud of something always tends to lead back to it.<br>For example, I've always been fascinated by comb-overs, especially<br>the extreme sort that<br>make a man look as if he's wearing a beret made of his own hair.<br>Surely this is a lowly sort of thing to be interested in-- the<br>sort of superficial quizzing<br>best left to teenage girls. And yet there is something underneath.<br>The key question, I realized, is how does the comber-over not<br>see how odd he looks?<br>And the answer is that he got to look that way _incrementally._<br>What began as combing his hair a little carefully over a<br>thin patch has gradually, over 20 years, grown into a monstrosity.<br>Gradualness is very powerful. And that power can be<br>used for constructive purposes too: just as you can trick<br>yourself into looking like a freak, you can trick yourself into<br>creating something so grand that you would never have dared to<br>_plan_ such a thing. Indeed, this is just how most good<br>software gets created. You start by writing a stripped-down<br>kernel (how hard can it be?) and gradually it grows<br>into a complete operating system. Hence the next leap: could<br>you do the same thing in painting, or in a novel?<br>See what you can extract from a frivolous question?<br>If there's one piece of advice I would give about writing essays,<br>it would be: don't do as you're told.<br>Don't believe what you're supposed to.<br>Don't write the<br>essay readers expect; one learns nothing from<br>what one expects.<br>And<br>don't write the way they taught you to in school.<br>The most important sort of disobedience is to write<br>essays at all. Fortunately, this sort of disobedience shows<br>signs of becoming <br>[rampant](http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1056050270.php). <br>It used to be that only a tiny<br>number of officially approved writers were allowed to<br>write essays. Magazines published few of them, and judged<br>them less by what they said than who wrote them;<br>a magazine might publish a story by an<br>unknown writer if it was good enough, but if they published<br>an essay on x it had to be by someone who was at least<br>forty and whose job title had x in it. Which is a problem,<br>because there are a lot of things insiders can't say precisely<br>because they're insiders.<br>The Internet is changing that.<br>Anyone can publish an essay on the Web, and it gets judged, as any<br>writing should, by what it says, not who wrote it.<br>Who are you to write about x? You are whatever you wrote.<br>Popular magazines made the period between the spread<br>of literacy and the arrival of TV the golden age of the<br>short story.<br>The Web may well make this the golden age of the essay.<br>And that's certainly not something I realized when<br>I started writing this.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\] I'm thinking of Oresme (c. 1323-82). But it's hard to pick<br>a date, because there was a sudden drop-off in scholarship<br>just as Europeans finished assimilating classical science.<br>The cause may have been the plague of 1347; the trend in<br>scientific progress matches the population curve.<br>\[2\] Parker, William R.

It would not be far from the truth to say that <br>education in the classical world<br>meant training landowners' sons<br>to speak well enough to defend their interests<br>in political and legal disputes.<br>\[6\] Trevor Blackwell points out that this<br>isn't strictly true, because the outside <br>edges of curves erode faster.<br>**Thanks** to Ken Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica<br>Livingston, Jackie McDonough, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of<br>this. |
