| ![What You'll Wish You'd Known](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/what-you-ll-wish-you-d-known-2.gif)<br>January 2005<br>_(I wrote this talk for a_<br>_high school. I never actually_<br>_gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)_<br>When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious.<br>What will you say to high school students? So I asked them, what<br>do you wish someone had told you in high school? Their answers<br>were remarkably similar. So I'm going to tell you what we all wish<br>someone had told us.<br>I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high<br>school: what you want to do with your life. People are always<br>asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer.<br>But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter. They want<br>to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to<br>get you talking. They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab<br>in a tide pool, to see what it does.<br>If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd<br>say that my first priority was to learn what the options were. You<br>don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work. What you <br>need to do is discover what you like. You have to work on stuff <br>you like if you want to be good at what you do.<br>It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you<br>like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's hard to get<br>an accurate picture of most jobs. Being a doctor is not the way<br>it's portrayed on TV. Fortunately you can also watch real doctors,<br>by volunteering in hospitals. \[1\]<br>But there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is<br>doing them yet. Most of the work I've done in the last ten years<br>didn't exist when I was in high school. The world changes fast, <br>and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a<br>world it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.<br>And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard <br>Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don't give up on your<br>dreams. I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it,<br>because it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you<br>made early on. The computer world has a name for this: premature<br>optimization. And it is synonymous with disaster. These speakers<br>would do better to say simply, don't give up.<br>What they really mean is, don't get demoralized. Don't think that <br>you can't do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn't <br>underestimate your potential. People who've done great things tend<br>to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only <br>exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude <br>biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how<br>the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems<br>like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding<br>of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen<br>year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem<br>impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.<br>Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then<br>they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one <br>reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for<br>being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because<br>of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our<br>fault if we can't do something as good.<br>I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're<br>trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse <br>for being lazy, the other one is probably right.<br>So far we've cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from "don't<br>give up on your dreams" to "what someone else can do, you can do."<br>But it needs to be cut still further. There is _some_ variation<br>in natural ability. Most people overestimate its role, but it does <br>exist. If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition <br>was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can<br>do anything if you really try. \[2\]<br>We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, "what someone<br>else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don't underestimate<br>your abilities." But as so often happens, the closer you get to<br>the truth, the messier your sentence gets. We've taken a nice, <br>neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle. It<br>doesn't make a very good speech anymore. But worse still, it doesn't<br>tell you what to do anymore. Someone with your abilities? What <br>are your abilities?<br>**Upwind**<br>I think the solution is to work in the other direction. Instead<br>of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations.<br>This is what most successful people actually do anyway.<br>In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be<br>in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there? <br>I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future,<br>but just look at the options available now, and choose those that<br>will give you the most promising range of options afterward.<br>It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting<br>your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your<br>options, and worry later about which you'll take.<br>Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math <br>or economics. Well, math will give you more options: you can go into<br>almost any field from math. If you major in math it will be easy<br>to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics<br>it will be hard to get into grad school in math.<br>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't<br>have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot<br>of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places <br>to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to<br>stay upwind. So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give <br>up on your dreams." Stay upwind.<br>How do you do that, though? Even if math is upwind of economics,<br>how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?<br>Well, you don't, and that's what you need to find out.  Look for smart people<br>and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you<br>can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it. But<br>it's not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of <br>faking going on.<br>To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look<br>much the same. The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual<br>and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders. But while in some<br>fields the papers are unintelligible because they're full of hard<br>ideas, in others they're deliberately written in an obscure way to<br>seem as if they're saying something important. This may seem a <br>scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified,<br>in the famous _Social Text_ affair. Suspecting that the papers<br>published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding<br>nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of<br>intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary<br>theory journal, which published it.<br>The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. <br>Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. <br>Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that<br>something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be <br>able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard<br>enough. There has to be suspense.<br>Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think. What I'm<br>telling you is that you should worry? Yes, but it's not as bad as<br>it sounds. It's exhilarating to overcome worries. You don't see<br>faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know<br>why they're so happy? Relief.<br>I'm not saying this is the only way to be happy. Just that some<br>kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.<br>**Ambition**<br>In practice, "stay upwind" reduces to "work on hard problems." And <br>you can start today. I wish I'd grasped that in<br>high school.<br>Most people like to be good at what they do. In the so-called real <br>world this need is a powerful force. But high school students<br>rarely benefit from it, because they're given a fake thing to do. <br>When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to <br>be a high school student. And so I let my need to be good at what <br>I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.<br>If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between<br>high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had <br>to earn a living. Wrong. It's that adults take responsibility for<br>themselves. Making a living is only a small part of it.<br>Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.<br>If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day<br>job. I don't mean that I'd slack in school. Working at something<br>as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly. It means not being defined<br>by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student,<br>just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of <br>himself as a waiter. \[3\] And when I wasn't working at my day job<br>I'd start trying to do real work.<br>When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they<br>nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time. If<br>you're wondering what you're doing now that you'll regret most<br>later, that's probably it. \[4\]<br>Some people say this is inevitable — that high school students<br>aren't capable of getting anything done yet. But I don't think<br>this is true. And the proof is that you're bored. You probably<br>weren't bored when you were eight. When you're eight it's called<br>"playing" instead of "hanging out," but it's the same thing. And<br>when I was eight, I was rarely bored. Give me a back yard and a<br>few other kids and I could play all day.<br>The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now<br>realize, is that I was ready for something else. Childhood was<br>getting old.<br>I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends — that you<br>should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work.<br>Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more<br>if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate <br>cake for every meal. No matter how much you like chocolate cake,<br>you'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it. And that's <br>what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness.<br>\[5\]<br>You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades. We<br>have to have _extracurricular activities._ But you know<br>perfectly well how bogus most of these are. Collecting donations<br>for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not _hard._<br>It's not getting something done. What I mean by getting something<br>done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers,<br>or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to <br>draw the human face from life. This sort of thing rarely translates<br>into a line item on a college application.<br>**Corruption**<br>It's dangerous to design your life around getting into college, <br>because the people you have to impress to get into college are not <br>a very discerning audience. At most colleges, it's not the professors<br>who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they<br>are nowhere near as smart. They're the NCOs of the intellectual<br>world. They can't tell how smart you are.<br>The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.<br>Few parents<br>would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn't <br>improve their admissions prospects. Prep schools openly say this<br>is one of their aims. But what that means, if you stop to <br>think about it, is that they can<br>hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid<br>and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he <br>went to the local public school. \[6\]<br>Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising<br>college applicant. But that means you're designing your life to<br>satisfy a process so mindless that there's a whole industry devoted<br>to subverting it. No wonder you become cynical. The malaise you<br>feel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco <br>industry executive feels. And you don't even get paid a lot.<br>So what do you do? What you should not do is rebel. That's what<br>I did, and it was a mistake. I didn't realize exactly what was <br>happening to us, but I smelled a major rat. And so I just gave up.<br>Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?<br>When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff's<br>Notes, it seemed par for the course. Surely it meant nothing to<br>get a good grade in such a class.<br>In retrospect this was stupid. It was like someone getting fouled<br>in a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that's against the<br>rules, and walking off the field in indignation. Fouls happen. <br>The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool. Just<br>keep playing. <br>By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you. Yes, <br>as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is <br>crap. And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is<br>largely a charade. But like many fouls, this one was unintentional.<br>\[7\] So just keep playing.<br>Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience. In either case you let<br>yourself be defined by what they tell you to do. The best plan, I<br>think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector. Don't just do what <br>they tell you, and don't just refuse to. Instead treat school as<br>a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3<br>o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.<br>**Curiosity**<br>And what's your real job supposed to be? Unless you're Mozart, <br>your first task is to figure that out. What are the great things<br>to work on? Where are the imaginative people? And most importantly,<br>what are you interested in? The word "aptitude" is misleading,<br>because it implies something innate. The most powerful sort of<br>aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests<br>are often acquired tastes.<br>A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture<br>under the name "passion." I recently saw an ad for waiters saying<br>they wanted people with a "passion for service." The real thing <br>is not something one could have for waiting on tables. And passion<br>is a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.<br>Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid<br>curiosity. Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at<br>random about everything. In most adults this curiosity dries up<br>entirely. It has to: you can't get anything done if you're always<br>asking why about everything. But in ambitious adults, instead of<br>drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep. The mud flat morphs<br>into a well.<br>Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a<br>book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a<br>mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work<br>to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it<br>in a class.<br>One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea<br>that doing great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects<br>are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that<br>you can flog yourself through them. So I was surprised when, early<br>in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no <br>self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, <br>not even a cup of coffee.<br>Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same<br>with all of them. They have little discipline. They're all terrible<br>procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves<br>do anything they're not interested in. One still hasn't sent out<br>his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago.<br>Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.<br>I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You <br>probably need about the amount you need to go running. I'm often <br>reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't <br>run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who <br>do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work,<br>and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks<br>to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over,<br>and discipline is no longer necessary.<br>Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently<br>trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having<br>fun. That's why he's so good.<br>If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity <br>about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein<br>was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell<br>is going on here?<br>It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it<br>can take years to figure out what a subject is really about. To<br>take an extreme example, consider math. Most people think they<br>hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name<br>"mathematics" is not at all like what mathematicians do.<br>The great mathematician G. H. Hardy said he didn't like math in <br>high school either. He only took it up because he was better at<br>it than the other students. Only later did he realize math was<br>interesting — only later did he start to ask questions instead of<br>merely answering them correctly.<br>When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a<br>paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it<br>interesting. That's what you need to do: find a question that makes<br>the world interesting. People who do great things look at the same<br>world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's<br>compellingly mysterious.<br>And not only in intellectual matters. Henry Ford's great question <br>was, why do cars have to be a luxury item? What would happen if<br>you treated them as a commodity? Franz Beckenbauer's was, in effect,<br>why does everyone have to stay in his position? Why can't defenders<br>score goals too?<br>**Now**<br>If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now,<br>at sixteen? Work toward finding one. Great questions don't appear<br>suddenly. They gradually congeal in your head. And what makes<br>them congeal is experience. So the way to find great questions is<br>not to search for them — not to wander about thinking, what great <br>discovery shall I make? You can't answer that; if you could, you'd <br>have made it.<br>The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for<br>big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you,<br>and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can<br>take roost. Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe.<br>They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys. So <br>when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to<br>notice it.<br>Put in time how and on what? Just pick a project that seems<br>interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something,<br>or to answer some question. Choose a project that will take less<br>than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish.<br>Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially <br>at first. If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever <br>seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat<br>till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes <br>self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This<br>could take years.)<br>It may be just as well not to do a project "for school," if that<br>will restrict you or make it seem like work. Involve your friends<br>if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes. <br>Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person),<br>but secrecy also has its advantages. There's something pleasing<br>about a secret project. And you can take more risks, because no <br>one will know if you fail.<br>Don't worry if a project doesn't seem to be on the path to some<br>goal you're supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you<br>think. So let the path grow out the project. The most important<br>thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you <br>learn.<br>Don't disregard unseemly motivations. One of the most powerful is<br>the desire to be better than other people at something. Hardy said<br>that's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing <br>about him is that he admitted it. Another powerful motivator is<br>the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to. Closely<br>related is the desire to do something audacious. Sixteen year olds<br>aren't supposed to write novels. So if you try, anything you achieve<br>is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing<br>no worse than expectations. \[8\]<br>Beware of bad models. Especially when they excuse laziness. When <br>I was in high school I used to write "existentialist" short stories<br>like ones I'd seen by famous writers. My stories didn't have a lot<br>of plot, but they were very deep. And they were less work to write<br>than entertaining ones would have been. I should have known that<br>was a danger sign. And in fact I found my stories pretty boring; <br>what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff<br>like the famous writers.<br>Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers<br>actually sucked. Plenty of famous people do; in the short term,<br>the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame. <br>I should have been less worried about doing something<br>that seemed cool, and just done something I liked. That's the<br>actual road to coolness anyway.<br>A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is <br>to find good books. Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are<br>bad. \[9\] So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever<br>book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for <br>the tiny number of good books.<br>The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of<br>waiting to be taught, go out and learn.<br>Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It <br>could be shaped by your own curiosity. It is for all ambitious <br>adults. And you don't have to wait to start. In fact, you don't <br>have to wait to be an adult. There's no switch inside you that<br>magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some<br>institution. You start being an adult when you decide to take<br>responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age. \[10\]<br>This may sound like bullshit. I'm just a minor, you may think, I<br>have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults <br>tell me all day long. Well, most adults labor under restrictions <br>just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done. If you<br>think it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.<br>The only real difference between adults and high school kids is<br>that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school<br>kids don't. That realization hits most people around 23. But I'm<br>letting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can<br>be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't<br>how much time you wasted.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate <br>picture. "Who knew how much time it would take up, how little<br>autonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how<br>unbelievably annoying it is to carry a beeper?"<br>\[2\] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate<br>the NBA into letting him play. So far the closest anyone has come<br>is Secretary of Labor.<br>\[3\] A day job is one you take to pay the bills so you can do what<br>you really want, like play in a band, or invent relativity.<br>Treating high school as a day job might actually make it easier for<br>some students to get good grades. If you treat your classes<br>as a game, you won't be demoralized if they seem pointless.<br>However bad your classes, you need to get good grades in them to <br>get into a decent college. And that _is_ worth doing, because<br>universities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these<br>days.<br>\[4\] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant<br>things. And especially about what other people thought of them.<br>I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what<br>random people thought of them. Adults care just as much what other<br>people think, but they get to be more selective about the other<br>people.<br>I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about,<br>and the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me. The<br>problem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by <br>accidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect<br>for their judgement.<br>\[5\] The key to wasting time is distraction. Without distractions<br>it's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing anything with<br>it, and you start to feel uncomfortable. If you want to measure <br>how dependent you've become on distractions, try this experiment:<br>set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think.<br>You can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing<br>else: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, Web, games, books, <br>newspapers, or magazines. Within an hour most people will feel a <br>strong craving for distraction.<br>\[6\] I don't mean to imply that the only function of prep schools<br>is to trick admissions officers. They also generally provide a <br>better education. But try this thought experiment: suppose prep<br>schools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.001)<br>negative effect on college admissions. How many parents would still<br>send their kids to them?<br>It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because<br>they've learned more, _are_ better college candidates. But<br>this seems empirically false. What you learn in even the best high<br>school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college. <br>Public school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage, <br>but they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.<br>(I'm not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just<br>that they are within any given college. That follows necessarily<br>if you agree prep schools improve kids' admissions prospects.)<br>\[7\] Why does society foul you? Indifference, mainly. There are<br>simply no outside forces pushing high school to be good. The air<br>traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise.<br>Businesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take<br>their customers. But no planes crash if your school sucks, and it<br>has no competitors. High school isn't evil; it's random; but random<br>is pretty bad.<br>\[8\] And then of course there is money. It's not a big factor in<br>high school, because you can't do much that anyone wants. But a<br>lot of great things were created mainly to make money. Samuel<br>Johnson said "no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money."<br>(Many hope he was exaggerating.)<br>\[9\] Even college textbooks are bad. When you get to college,<br>you'll find that (with a few stellar exceptions) the textbooks are<br>not written by the leading scholars in the field they describe.<br>Writing college textbooks is unpleasant work, done mostly by people<br>who need the money. It's unpleasant because the publishers exert<br>so much control, and there are few things worse than close supervision<br>by someone who doesn't understand what you're doing. This phenomenon<br>is apparently <br>[even worse](http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine) in the production of high school textbooks.<br>\[10\] Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults.<br>I wonder if they'd like it if you did. You may be loud and<br>disorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults. If you<br>actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch<br>of adults had been transposed into your bodies. Imagine the reaction<br>of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had<br>to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go<br>at a time. To say nothing of the things you're taught.
