| ![Write Simply](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/write-simply-4.gif)<br>March 2021<br>I try to write using ordinary words and simple sentences.<br>That kind of writing is easier to read, and the easier something<br>is to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it. The less<br>energy they expend on your prose, the more they'll have left for<br>your ideas.<br>And the further they'll read. Most readers' energy tends to flag<br>part way through an article or essay. If the friction of reading<br>is low enough, more keep going till the end.<br>There's an Italian dish called _saltimbocca_, which means "leap<br>into the mouth." My goal when writing might be called _saltintesta_:<br>the ideas leap into your head and you barely notice the words that<br>got them there.<br>It's too much to hope that writing could ever be pure ideas. You<br>might not even want it to be. But for most writers, most of the<br>time, that's the goal to aim for. The gap between most writing and<br>pure ideas is not filled with poetry.<br>Plus it's more considerate to write simply. When you write in a<br>fancy way to impress people, you're making them do extra work just<br>so you can seem cool. It's like trailing a long train behind you<br>that readers have to carry.<br>And remember, if you're writing in English, that a lot of your<br>readers won't be native English speakers. Their understanding of<br>ideas may be way ahead of their understanding of English. So you<br>can't assume that writing about a difficult topic means you can<br>use difficult words.<br>Of course, fancy writing doesn't just conceal ideas. It can also<br>conceal the lack of them. That's why some people write that way,<br>to conceal the fact that they have <br> nothing to say. Whereas writing<br>simply keeps you honest. If you say nothing simply, it will be<br>obvious to everyone, including you.<br>Simple writing also lasts better. People reading your stuff in the<br>future will be in much the same position as people from other<br>countries reading it today. The culture and the language will have<br>changed. It's not vain to care about that, any more than it's vain<br>for a woodworker to build a chair to last.<br>Indeed, lasting is not merely an accidental quality of chairs, or<br>writing. It's a sign you did a good job.<br>But although these are all real advantages of writing simply, none<br>of them are why I do it. The main reason I write simply is that it<br>offends me not to. When I write a sentence that seems too complicated,<br>or that uses unnecessarily intellectual words, it doesn't seem fancy<br>to me. It seems clumsy.<br>There are of course times when you want to use a complicated sentence<br>or fancy word for effect. But you should never do it by accident.<br>The other reason my writing ends up being simple is the way I do<br>it. I write the first draft fast, then spend days editing it, trying<br>to get everything just right. Much of this editing is cutting, and<br>that makes simple writing even simpler. |
