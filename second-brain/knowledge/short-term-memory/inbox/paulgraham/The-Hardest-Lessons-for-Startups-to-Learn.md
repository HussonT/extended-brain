| ![The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-hardest-lessons-for-startups-to-learn-2.gif)<br>April 2006<br>_(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2006_<br>_[Startup School](http://startupschool.org/).)_<br>The startups we've funded so far are pretty quick, but they seem<br>quicker to learn some lessons than others. I think it's because<br>some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.<br>We've now <br>[invested](http://ycombinator.com/) <br>in enough companies that I've learned a trick<br>for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones:<br>they're the ones I have to keep repeating.<br>So I'm going to number these points, and maybe with future startups<br>I'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding. I'll make them<br>all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I'll<br>just be able to say: _number four!_<br>**1\. Release Early.**<br>The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: get<br>a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users' reactions.<br>By "release early" I don't mean you should release something full<br>of bugs, but that you should release something minimal. Users hate<br>bugs, but they don't seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there's<br>more coming soon.<br>There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast. One<br>is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for<br>a startup or not. I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to<br>contradict it. I've seen a lot of startups die because they were<br>too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html#f1n)\]<br>One of the things that will surprise you if you build something<br>popular is that you won't know your users. [Reddit](http://reddit.com/) now has almost half a million<br>unique visitors a month. Who are all those people? They have no<br>idea. No web startup does. And since you don't know your users,<br>it's dangerous to guess what they'll like. Better to release<br>something and let them tell you.<br>[Wufoo](http://wufoo.com/) took this to heart and released<br>their form-builder before the underlying database. You can't even<br>drive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver's<br>seat and hold the steering wheel. And Wufoo got valuable feedback<br>from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they<br>rewrote their software not to. If they'd waited to release everything<br>at once, they wouldn't have discovered this problem till it was<br>more deeply wired in.<br>Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release<br>quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown<br>cruise. If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good,<br>for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting<br>that first version out will expose it. And if you have such problems<br>you want to find them early.<br>Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that<br>it makes you work harder. When you're working on something that<br>isn't released, problems are intriguing. In something that's out<br>there, problems are alarming. There is a lot more urgency once you<br>release. And I think that's precisely why people put it off. They<br>know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html#f2n)\]<br>**2\. Keep Pumping Out Features.**<br>Of course, "release early" has a second component, without which<br>it would be bad advice. If you're going to start with something<br>that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast.<br>What I find myself repeating is "pump out features." And this rule<br>isn't just for the initial stages. This is something all startups<br>should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.<br>I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever<br>more complex. By "feature" I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum<br>of making users' lives better.<br>As with exercise, improvements beget improvements. If you run every<br>day, you'll probably feel like running tomorrow. But if you skip<br>running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself<br>out. So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more<br>ideas you'll have. You should make your system better at least in<br>some small way every day or two.<br>This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a<br>form of marketing. Users love a site that's constantly improving.<br>In fact, users expect a site to improve. Imagine if you visited a<br>site that seemed very good, and then returned two months later and<br>not one thing had changed. Wouldn't it start to seem lame? <br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html#f3n)\]<br>They'll like you even better when you improve in response to their<br>comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them.<br>If you're the rare exception-- a company that actually listens--<br>you'll generate fanatical loyalty. You won't need to advertise,<br>because your users will do it for you.<br>This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it? I<br>think the problem here is that people get used to how things are.<br>Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, you<br>start to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happens<br>to have become its identity. For example, I doubt many people at<br>Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail<br>could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.<br>I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far<br>short of what it could be. Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual<br>exercise, to keep thinking of improvements. Ok, sure, what you<br>have is perfect. But if you had to change something, what would<br>it be?<br>If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations:<br>(a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination. Experience suggests<br>(b) is a thousand times more likely.<br>**3\. Make Users Happy.**<br>Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make<br>users happy. One thing all startups have in common is that they<br>can't force anyone to do anything. They can't force anyone to use<br>their software, and they can't force anyone to do deals with them.<br>A startup has to sing for its supper. That's why the successful<br>ones make great things. They have to, or die.<br>When you're running a startup you feel like a little bit of debris<br>blown about by powerful winds. The most powerful wind is users.<br>They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did<br>with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with<br>most startups. Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any<br>other. If they take you up, no competitor can keep you down.<br>As a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do is<br>not to lie flat, but to curl yourself into a shape the wind will<br>catch.<br>I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the<br>stream of traffic is. The vast majority of people who visit your<br>site will be casual visitors. It's them you have to design your<br>site for. The people who really care will find what they want by<br>themselves.<br>The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back<br>button. Think about your own experience: most links you<br>follow lead to something lame. Anyone who has used the web for<br>more than a couple weeks has been _trained_ to click on Back after<br>following a link. So your site has to say "Wait! Don't click on<br>Back. This site isn't lame. Look at this, for example."<br>There are two things you have to do to make people pause. The most<br>important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell<br>your site is about. How often have you visited a site that seemed<br>to assume you already knew what they did? For example, the corporate<br>site that says the<br>company makes<br>> enterprise content management solutions for business that enable<br>>  organizations to unify people, content and processes to minimize<br>>  business risk, accelerate time-to-value and sustain lower total<br>>  cost of ownership.<br>An established company may get away with such an opaque description,<br>but no startup can. A startup<br>should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it<br>does. <br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html#f4n)\]<br>And not just to users. You need this for everyone:<br>investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and<br>even current employees. You probably shouldn't even start a company<br>to do something that can't be described compellingly in one or two<br>sentences.<br>The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you've got,<br>right away. If you have something impressive, try to put it on the<br>front page, because that's the only one most visitors will see.<br>Though indeed there's a paradox here: the more you push the good<br>stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore<br>further. <br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html#f5n)\]<br>In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell<br>visitors what your site is about by _showing_ them. One of the<br>standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is "show, don't tell."<br>Don't say that a character's angry; have him grind his teeth, or<br>break his pencil in half. Nothing will explain what your site does<br>so well as using it.<br>The industry term here is "conversion." The job of your site is<br>to convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your definition<br>of a user is. You can measure this in your growth rate. Either<br>your site is catching on, or it isn't, and you must know which. If<br>you have decent growth, you'll win in the end, no matter how obscure<br>you are now. And if you don't, you need to fix something.<br>**4\. Fear the Right Things.**<br>Another thing I find myself saying a lot is "don't worry." Actually,<br>it's more often "don't worry about this; worry about that instead."<br>Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong<br>things.<br>Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem. Disasters<br>are normal in a startup: a founder quits, you discover a patent<br>that covers what you're doing, your servers keep crashing, you run<br>into an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name,<br>a deal falls through-- these are all par for the course. They won't<br>kill you unless you let them.<br>Nor will most competitors. A lot of startups worry "what if Google<br>builds something like us?" Actually big companies are not the ones<br>you have to worry about-- not even Google. The people at Google<br>are smart, but no smarter than you; they're not as motivated, because<br>Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails;<br>and even at Google they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down.<br>What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players,<br>but other startups you don't know exist yet. They're way more<br>dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered animals.<br>Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of<br>security. You should compete against what someone else _could_ be<br>doing, not just what you can see people doing. A corollary is that<br>you shouldn't relax just because you have no visible competitors<br>yet. No matter what your idea, there's someone else out there<br>working on the same thing.<br>That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people<br>are doing it. But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that<br>makes this a bad time to start a startup. More people are starting<br>startups, but not as many more as could. Most college graduates<br>still think they have to get a job. The average person can't ignore<br>something that's been beaten into their head since they were three<br>just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper.<br>And in any case, competitors are not the biggest threat. Way more<br>startups hose themselves than get crushed by competitors. There<br>are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal<br>disputes, inertia, and ignoring users. Each is, by itself, enough<br>to kill you. But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring<br>users. If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die,<br>here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know<br>everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build,<br>no matter what.<br>Almost everyone's initial plan is broken. If companies stuck to<br>their initial plans, Microsoft would be selling programming languages,<br>and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards. In both cases<br>their customers told them what their business should be-- and they<br>were smart enough to listen.<br>As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than<br>the imagination of man. You'll find more interesting things by<br>looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.<br>This principle is very powerful. It's why the best abstract painting<br>still falls short of Leonardo, for example. And it applies to<br>startups too. No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the<br>ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam<br>of users.<br>**5\. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.**<br>I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what<br>the most important quality is in a startup founder, and it's not<br>what you might think. The most important quality in a startup<br>founder is determination. Not intelligence-- determination.<br>This is a little depressing. I'd like to believe Viaweb succeeded<br>because we were smart, not merely determined. A lot of people in<br>the startup world want to believe that. Not just founders, but<br>investors too. They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by<br>intelligence. And you can tell they really believe this, because<br>it affects their investment decisions.<br>Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors.<br>This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize<br>existing research, but in software you want to invest in students,<br>not professors. Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by<br>people who dropped out of school to do it. What students lack in<br>experience they more than make up in dedication.<br>Of course, if you want to get rich, it's not enough merely to be<br>determined. You have to be smart too, right? I'd like to think<br>so, but I've had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spent<br>several years living in New York.<br>You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won't kill<br>you. But lose even a little bit in the commitment department, and<br>that will kill you very rapidly.<br>Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it's possible, but<br>it requires extraordinary effort. If an ordinary employee were<br>asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very<br>indignant. Imagine if you were hired at some big company, and in<br>addition to writing software ten times faster than you'd ever had<br>to before, they expected you to answer support calls, administer<br>the servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find the<br>company office space, and go out and get everyone lunch.<br>And to do all this not in the calm, womb-like atmosphere of a big<br>company, but against a backdrop of constant disasters. That's the<br>part that really demands determination. In a startup, there's<br>always some disaster happening. So if you're the least bit inclined<br>to find an excuse to quit, there's always one right there.<br>But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting<br>you long before you actually quit. Everyone who deals with startups<br>knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you're ambivalent,<br>they won't give you much attention. If you lack commitment, you'll<br>just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to<br>your competitors but not to you. If you lack commitment, it will<br>seem to you that you're unlucky.<br>Whereas if you're determined to stick around, people will pay<br>attention to you, because odds are they'll have to deal with you<br>later. You're a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come<br>to terms with you.<br>At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the<br>attitude that they're going to give this startup thing a shot for<br>three months, and if something great happens, they'll stick with<br>it-- "something great" meaning either that someone wants to buy<br>them or invest millions of dollars in them. But if this is your<br>attitude, "something great" is very unlikely to happen to you,<br>because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of<br>commitment.<br>If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what,<br>they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you<br>stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and<br>they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier. Ditto for<br>investors. What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not<br>the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out. <br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html#f6n)\]<br>So if<br>you make it clear you're going to succeed no matter what, and the only<br>reason you need them is to make it happen a little faster, you're<br>much more likely to get money.<br>You can't fake this. The only way to convince everyone that you're<br>ready to fight to the death is actually to be ready to.<br>You have to be the right kind of determined, though. I carefully<br>chose the word determined rather than stubborn, because stubbornness<br>is a disastrous quality in a startup. You have to be determined,<br>but flexible, like a running back. A successful running back doesn't<br>just put his head down and try to run through people. He improvises:<br>if someone appears in front of him, he runs around them; if someone<br>tries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he'll even run in<br>the wrong direction briefly if that will help. The one thing he'll<br>never do is stand still. <br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html#f7n)\]<br>**6\. There Is Always Room.**<br>I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might<br>be good to add a social component to their software. He said he<br>didn't think so, because the whole social thing was tapped out.<br>Really? So in a hundred years the only social networking sites<br>will be the Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and Del.icio.us? Not likely.<br>There is always room for new stuff. At every point in history,<br>even the darkest bits of the dark ages, people were discovering<br>things that made everyone say "why didn't anyone think of that<br>before?" We know this continued to be true up till 2004, when the<br>Facebook was founded-- though strictly speaking someone else did<br>think of that.<br>The reason we don't see the opportunities all around us is that we<br>adjust to however things are, and assume that's how things have to<br>be. For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make<br>a better search engine than Google. Surely that field, at least,<br>is tapped out. Really? In a hundred years-- or even twenty-- are<br>people still going to search for information using something like<br>the current Google? Even Google probably doesn't think that.<br>In particular, I don't think there's any limit to the number of<br>startups. Sometimes you hear people saying "All these guys starting<br>startups now are going to be disappointed. How many little startups<br>are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?" That sounds cleverly<br>skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken. No one proposes that<br>there's some limit to the number of people who can be employed in<br>an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple<br>thousand people each. Why should there be any limit to the number<br>who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each?<br>It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who<br>want to work that hard.<br>The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get<br>acquired by Google and Yahoo-- though it seems even that should<br>be unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying-- but the<br>amount of wealth that can be created. And I don't think there's<br>any limit on that, except cosmological ones.<br>So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of<br>startups. Startups make wealth, which means they make things people<br>want, and if there's a limit on the number of things people want,<br>we are nowhere near it. I still don't even have a flying car.<br>**7\. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.**<br>This is another one I've been repeating since long before Y Combinator.<br>It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb.<br>Startup founders are naturally optimistic. They wouldn't do it<br>otherwise. But you should treat your optimism the way you'd treat<br>the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also<br>very dangerous. You have to build a shield around it, or it will<br>fry you.<br>The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would be<br>useless if it were. It's pierced in a few places to let pipes in.<br>An optimism shield has to be pierced too. I think the place to<br>draw the line is between what you expect of yourself, and what you<br>expect of other people. It's ok to be optimistic about what you<br>can do, but assume the worst about machines and other people.<br>This is particularly necessary in a startup, because you tend to<br>be pushing the limits of whatever you're doing. So things don't<br>happen in the smooth, predictable way they do in the rest of the<br>world. Things change suddenly, and usually for the worse.<br>Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals.<br>If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not going to<br>happen. The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't.<br>The company that says they're going to buy you isn't. The big<br>customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't.<br>Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.<br>The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save<br>them from being _disappointed_ when things fall through. It's<br>for a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning their<br>company against something that's going to fall over, taking them<br>with it.<br>For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there's a<br>natural tendency to stop looking for other investors. That's why<br>people proposing deals seem so positive: they _want_ you to<br>stop looking. And you want to stop too, because doing deals is a<br>pain. Raising money, in particular, is a huge time sink. So you<br>have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.<br>Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage<br>to have kept looking, because you'll get better terms. Deals are<br>dynamic; unless you're negotiating with someone unusually honest,<br>there's not a single point where you shake hands and the deal's<br>done. There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared<br>up after the handshake, and if the other side senses weakness-- if<br>they sense you need this deal-- they will be very tempted to screw<br>you in the details.<br>VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators. They're trained<br>to take advantage of weakness. <br>\[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html#f8n)\]<br>So while they're often nice<br>guys, they just can't help it. And as pros they do this more than<br>you. So don't even try to bluff them. The only way a startup can<br>have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it. And if<br>you don't believe in a deal, you'll be less likely to depend on it.<br>So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads: when you<br>hear someone say the words "we want to invest in you" or "we want<br>to acquire you," I want the following phrase to appear automatically<br>in your head: _don't get your hopes up._ Just continue running<br>your company as if this deal didn't exist. Nothing is more likely<br>to make it close.<br>The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting<br>lots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it while investors<br>and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face.<br>**Speed, not Money**<br>The way I've described it, starting a startup sounds pretty stressful.<br>It is. When I talk to the founders of the companies we've funded,<br>they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, but I didn't<br>realize it would be this hard.<br>So why do it? It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress<br>to do something grand or heroic, but just to make money? Is making<br>money really that important?<br>No, not really. It seems ridiculous to me when people take business<br>too seriously. I regard making money as a boring errand to be got<br>out of the way as soon as possible. There is nothing grand or<br>heroic about starting a startup per se.<br>So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups? I'll tell<br>you why. Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get<br>rich, but as a way to work faster. You have to make a living, and<br>a startup is a way to get that done quickly, instead of letting it<br>drag on through your whole life.<br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html#f9n)\]<br>We take it for granted most of the time, but human life is fairly<br>miraculous. It is also palpably short. You're given this marvellous<br>thing, and then poof, it's taken away. You can see why people<br>invent gods to explain it. But even to people who don't believe<br>in gods, life commands respect. There are times in most of our<br>lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a<br>sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious. As Ben<br>Franklin said, if you love life, don't waste time, because time is<br>what life is made of.<br>So no, there's nothing particularly grand about making money. That's<br>not what makes startups worth the trouble. What's important about<br>startups is the speed. By compressing the dull but necessary task<br>of making a living into the smallest possible time, you show respect<br>for life, and there is something grand about that.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>Startups can die from releasing something full of bugs, and not<br>fixing them fast enough, but I don't know of any that died from<br>releasing something stable but minimal very early, then promptly<br>improving it.<br>\[2\]<br>I know this is why I haven't released Arc. The moment I do,<br>I'll have people nagging me for features.<br>\[3\]<br>A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application<br>in this respect. Users judge a site not as a single snapshot, but<br>as an animation with multiple frames. Of the two, I'd say the rate of<br>improvement is more important to users than where you currently<br>are.<br>\[4\]<br>It should not always tell this to users, however. For example,<br>MySpace is basically a replacement mall for mallrats. But it was<br>wiser for them, initially, to pretend that the site was about bands.<br>\[5\]<br>Similarly, don't make users register to try your site. Maybe<br>what you have is so valuable that visitors should gladly register<br>to get at it. But they've been trained to expect the opposite.<br>Most of the things they've tried on the web have sucked-- and<br>probably especially those that made them register.<br>\[6\]<br>VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way. They don't<br>make their money (if they make money) off their median investments.<br>In a typical fund, half the companies fail, most of the rest generate<br>mediocre returns, and one or two "make the fund" by succeeding<br>spectacularly. So if they miss just a few of the most promising<br>opportunities, it could hose the whole fund.<br>\[7\]<br>The attitude of a running back doesn't translate to soccer.<br>Though it looks great when a forward dribbles past multiple defenders,<br>a player who persists in trying such things will do worse in the<br>long term than one who passes.<br>\[8\]<br>The reason Y Combinator never negotiates valuations<br>is that we're not professional negotiators, and don't want to turn<br>into them.<br>\[9\]<br>There are two ways to do <br>[work you love](https://paulgraham.com/love.html): (a) to make money, then work<br>on what you love, or (b) to get a job where you get paid to work on<br>stuff you love.
