| ![The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-bus-ticket-theory-of-genius-4.gif)<br>November 2019<br>Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability<br>and determination. But there's a third ingredient that's not as<br>well understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic.<br>To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group<br>of people, and I'm going to choose bus ticket collectors. There<br>are people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, they<br>have an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect.<br>They can keep track of distinctions between different types of bus<br>tickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember. Because<br>we don't care enough. What's the point of spending so much time<br>thinking about old bus tickets?<br>Which leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession:<br>there is no point. A bus ticket collector's love is disinterested.<br>They're not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, but<br>for its own sake.<br>When you look at the lives of people who've done great work, you<br>see a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket<br>collector's obsessive interest in something that would have seemed<br>pointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most striking<br>features of Darwin's book about his voyage on the Beagle is the<br>sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His curiosity seems<br>infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out on<br>his slate what happens to series.<br>It's a mistake to think they were "laying the groundwork" for the<br>discoveries they made later. There's too much intention in that<br>metaphor. Like bus ticket collectors, they were doing it<br>because they liked it.<br>But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket<br>collector. Series matter, and bus tickets don't.<br>If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might<br>be it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.<br>Aren't I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you<br>might think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for<br>ability and a substitute for determination. Unless you have<br>sufficient mathematical aptitude, you won't find series interesting.<br>And when you're obsessively interested in something, you don't need<br>as much determination: you don't need to push yourself as hard when<br>curiosity is pulling you.<br>An obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extent<br>anything can. Chance, as Pasteur said, favors the prepared mind,<br>and if there's one thing an obsessed mind is, it's prepared.<br>The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most important<br>feature. Not just because it's a filter for earnestness, but because<br>it helps you discover new ideas.<br>The paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If they<br>looked promising, other people would already have explored them.<br>How do the people who do great work discover these paths that others<br>overlook? The popular story is that they simply have better vision:<br>because they're so talented, they see paths that others miss. But<br>if you look at the way great discoveries are made, that's not what<br>happens. Darwin didn't pay closer attention to individual species<br>than other people because he saw that this would lead to great<br>discoveries, and they didn't. He was just really, really interested<br>in such things.<br>Darwin couldn't turn it off. Neither could Ramanujan. They didn't<br>discover the hidden paths that they did because they seemed promising,<br>but because they couldn't help it. That's what allowed them to<br>follow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would have<br>ignored.<br>What rational person would decide that the way to write great novels<br>was to begin by spending several years creating an imaginary elvish<br>language, like Tolkien, or visiting every household in southwestern<br>Britain, like Trollope? No one, including Tolkien and Trollope.<br>The bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle's famous definition of<br>genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. But there are two<br>differences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the source<br>of this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence,<br>as Carlyle seems to have meant, but the sort of infinite interest<br>that collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: an<br>infinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters.<br>So what matters? You can never be sure. It's precisely because no<br>one can tell in advance which paths are promising that you can<br>discover new ideas by working on what you're interested in.<br>But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an<br>obsession might be one that matters. For example, it's more promising<br>if you're creating something, rather than just consuming something<br>someone else creates. It's more promising if something you're<br>interested in is difficult, especially if it's [more difficult for\<br>other people](https://paulgraham.com/work.html) than it is for you. And the obsessions of talented<br>people are more likely to be promising. When talented people become<br>interested in random things, they're not truly random.<br>But you can never be sure. In fact, here's an interesting idea<br>that's also rather alarming if it's true: it may be that to do great<br>work, you also have to waste a lot of time.<br>In many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If that<br>rule holds here, then the way to find paths that lead to truly great<br>work is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turn<br>out to be every bit as unpromising as they seem.<br>I'm not sure if this is true. On one hand, it seems surprisingly<br>difficult to waste your time so long as you're working hard on<br>something interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful.<br>But on the other hand, the rule about the relationship between risk<br>and reward is so powerful that it seems to hold wherever risk occurs.<br>[Newton's](https://paulgraham.com/disc.html) case, at least, suggests that the risk/reward rule holds<br>here. He's famous for one particular obsession of his that turned<br>out to be unprecedentedly fruitful: using math to describe the<br>world. But he had two other obsessions, alchemy and theology, that<br>seem to have been complete wastes of time. He ended up net ahead.<br>His bet on what we now call physics paid off so well that it more<br>than compensated for the other two. But were the other two necessary,<br>in the sense that he had to take big risks to make such big<br>discoveries? I don't know.<br>Here's an even more alarming idea: might one make all bad bets? It<br>probably happens quite often. But we don't know how often, because<br>these people don't become famous.<br>It's not merely that the returns from following a path are hard to<br>predict. They change dramatically over time. 1830 was a really good<br>time to be obsessively interested in natural history. If Darwin had<br>been born in 1709 instead of 1809, we might never have heard of<br>him.<br>What can one do in the face of such uncertainty? One solution is<br>to hedge your bets, which in this case means to follow the obviously<br>promising paths instead of your own private obsessions. But as with<br>any hedge, you're decreasing reward when you decrease risk. If you<br>forgo working on what you like in order to follow some more<br>conventionally ambitious path, you might miss something wonderful<br>that you'd otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all the<br>time, perhaps even more often than the genius whose bets all fail.<br>The other solution is to let yourself be interested in lots of<br>different things. You don't decrease your upside if you switch<br>between equally genuine interests based on which seems to be working<br>so far. But there is a danger here too: if you work on too many<br>different projects, you might not get deeply enough into any of<br>them.<br>One interesting thing about the bus ticket theory is that it may<br>help explain why different types of people excel at different kinds<br>of work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability.<br>If natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural<br>ability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theories<br>to explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actually<br>do great work in various fields. But it may be that much of the<br>skew has a simpler explanation: different people are interested in<br>different things.<br>The bus ticket theory also explains why people are less likely to<br>do great work after they have children. Here interest has to compete<br>not just with external obstacles, but with another interest, and<br>one that for most people is extremely powerful. It's harder to find<br>time for work after you have kids, but that's the easy part. The<br>real change is that you don't want to.<br>But the most exciting implication of the bus ticket theory is that<br>it suggests ways to encourage great work. If the recipe for genius<br>is simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope we<br>have a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interest<br>is a critical ingredient in genius, we may be able, by cultivating<br>interest, to cultivate genius.<br>For example, for the very ambitious, the bus ticket theory suggests<br>that the way to do great work is to relax a little. Instead of<br>gritting your teeth and diligently pursuing what all your peers<br>agree is the most promising line of research, maybe you should try<br>doing something just for fun. And if you're stuck, that may be the<br>vector along which to break out.<br>I've always liked [Hamming's](https://paulgraham.com/hamming.html) famous double-barrelled question: what<br>are the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you<br>working on one of them? It's a great way to shake yourself up. But<br>it may be overfitting a bit. It might be at least as useful to ask<br>yourself: if you could take a year off to work on something that<br>probably wouldn't be important but would be really interesting,<br>what would it be?<br>The bus ticket theory also suggests a way to avoid slowing down as<br>you get older. Perhaps the reason people have fewer new ideas as<br>they get older is not simply that they're losing their edge. It may<br>also be because once you become established, you can no longer mess<br>about with irresponsible side projects the way you could when you<br>were young and no one cared what you did.<br>The solution to that is obvious: remain irresponsible. It will be<br>hard, though, because the apparently random projects you take up<br>to stave off decline will read to outsiders as evidence of it. And<br>you yourself won't know for sure that they're wrong. But it will<br>at least be more fun to work on what you want.<br>It may even be that we can cultivate a habit of intellectual bus<br>ticket collecting in kids. The usual plan in education is to start<br>with a broad, shallow focus, then gradually become more specialized.<br>But I've done the opposite with my kids. I know I can count on their<br>school to handle the broad, shallow part, so I take them deep.<br>When they get interested in something, however random, I encourage<br>them to go preposterously, bus ticket collectorly, deep. I don't<br>do this because of the bus ticket theory. I do it because I want<br>them to feel the joy of learning, and they're never going to feel<br>that about something I'm making them learn. It has to be something<br>they're interested in. I'm just following the path of least resistance;<br>depth is a byproduct. But if in trying to show them the joy of<br>learning I also end up training them to go deep, so much the better.<br>Will it have any effect? I have no idea. But that uncertainty may<br>be the most interesting point of all. There is so much more to learn<br>about how to do great work. As old as human civilization feels,<br>it's really still very young if we haven't nailed something so<br>basic. It's exciting to think there are still discoveries to make<br>about discovery. If that's the sort of thing you're interested in.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\] There are other types of collecting that illustrate this point<br>better than bus tickets, but they're also more popular. It seemed<br>just as well to use an inferior example rather than offend more<br>people by telling them their hobby doesn't matter.<br>\[2\] I worried a little about using the word "disinterested," since<br>some people mistakenly believe it means not interested. But anyone<br>who expects to be a genius will have to know the meaning of such a<br>basic word, so I figure they may as well start now.<br>\[3\] Think how often genius must have been nipped in the bud by<br>people being told, or telling themselves, to stop messing about and<br>be responsible. Ramanujan's mother was a huge enabler. Imagine if<br>she hadn't been. Imagine if his parents had made him go out and get<br>a job instead of sitting around at home doing math.<br>On the other hand, anyone quoting the preceding paragraph to justify<br>not getting a job is probably mistaken.<br>\[4\] 1709 Darwin is to time what the [Milanese Leonardo](https://paulgraham.com/cities.html) is to space.<br>\[5\] "An infinite capacity for taking pains" is a paraphrase of what<br>Carlyle wrote. What he wrote, in his _History of Frederick the Great_,<br>was "... it is the fruit of 'genius' (which means transcendent<br>capacity of taking trouble, first of all)...." Since the paraphrase<br>seems the name of the idea at this point, I kept it.<br>Carlyle's _History_ was published in 1858. In 1785 Hérault de Séchelles<br>quoted Buffon as saying "Le génie n'est qu'une plus grande aptitude<br>à la patience." (Genius is only a greater aptitude for patience.)<br>\[6\] Trollope was establishing the system of postal routes. He himself<br>sensed the obsessiveness with which he pursued this goal.<br>> It is amusing to watch how a passion will grow upon a man. During<br>>  those two years it was the ambition of my life to cover the<br>>  country with rural letter-carriers.<br>Even Newton occasionally sensed the degree of his obsessiveness.<br>After computing pi to 15 digits, he wrote in a letter to a friend:<br>> I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these<br>>  computations, having no other business at the time.<br>Incidentally, Ramanujan was also a compulsive calculator. As Kanigel<br>writes in his excellent biography:<br>> One Ramanujan scholar, B. M. Wilson, later told how Ramanujan's<br>>  research into number theory was often "preceded by a table of<br>>  numerical results, carried usually to a length from which most<br>>  of us would shrink."<br>\[7\] Working to understand the natural world counts as creating<br>rather than consuming.<br>Newton tripped over this distinction when he chose<br>to work on theology. His beliefs did not allow him to see it, but<br>chasing down paradoxes in nature is fruitful in a way that chasing<br>down paradoxes in sacred texts is not.<br>\[8\] How much of people's propensity to become interested in a topic<br>is inborn? My experience so far suggests the answer is: most of<br>it. Different kids get interested in different things, and it's<br>hard to make a child interested in something they wouldn't otherwise<br>be. Not in a way that sticks. The most you can do on behalf of a<br>topic is to make sure it gets a fair showing — to make it clear to<br>them, for example, that there's more to math than the dull drills<br>they do in school. After that it's up to the child.<br>**Thanks** to Marc Andreessen, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Kevin<br>Lacker, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Lisa<br>Randall, Zak Stone, and [my 7 year old](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1196537802621669376) for reading drafts of this. |
