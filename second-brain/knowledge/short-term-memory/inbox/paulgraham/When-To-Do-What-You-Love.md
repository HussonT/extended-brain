| ![When To Do What You Love](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/when-to-do-what-you-love-1.gif)<br>September 2024<br>There's some debate about whether it's a good idea to "follow your<br>passion." In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple<br>yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't, but<br>the border between should and shouldn't is very complicated. The<br>only way to give a general answer is to trace it.<br>When people talk about this question, there's always an implicit<br>"instead of." All other things being equal, why wouldn't you work<br>on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies<br>that all other things aren't equal, and that you have to choose<br>between working on what interests you the most and something else,<br>like what pays the best.<br>And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can't usually<br>afford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for<br>doing what they want, not what you want. But there's an obvious<br>exception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you<br>love football, and you're good enough at it, you can get paid a lot<br>to play it.<br>Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because<br>so many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you<br>shouldn't try though. It depends how much ability you have and how<br>hard you're willing to work.<br>The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like<br>something that pays well and that few other people like. For example,<br>it's clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company.<br>He didn't just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved<br>writing software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed,<br>but if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it.<br>There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest<br>in making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can't<br>help noticing when something is mispriced, and can't help doing<br>something about it. It's like a puzzle for them.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/when.html#f1n)\]<br>In fact there's an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all<br>the preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really <br>huge<br>amount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars<br>— it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the<br>most. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing<br>this, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is<br>to start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent<br>way to discover [startup ideas](https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html).<br>Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the<br>founders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began<br>that way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas<br>tend to be such outliers that you'd overlook them if you were<br>consciously looking for ways to make money. Whereas if you're young<br>and good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would<br>be interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to<br>be built.<br>So there's something like a midwit peak for making money. If you<br>don't need to make much, you can work on whatever you're most<br>interested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can't<br>usually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you're<br>young and good at technology, working on what you're most interested<br>in becomes a good idea again.<br>What if you're not sure what you want? What if you're attracted to<br>the idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work<br>than others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break<br>ties?<br>The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent.<br>When you have trouble choosing between following your interests and<br>making money, it's never because you have complete knowledge of<br>yourself and of the types of work you're choosing between, and the<br>options are perfectly balanced. When you can't decide which path<br>to take, it's almost always due to ignorance. In fact you're usually<br>suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don't<br>know what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really<br>like, or how well you could do them. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/when.html#f2n)\]<br>In a way this ignorance is excusable. It's often hard to predict<br>these things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you're<br>ambitious you're told you should go to college, and this is good<br>advice so far as it goes, but that's where it usually ends. No one<br>tells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can<br>be.<br>What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And<br>probably the best way to do that is to try working on things you're<br>interested in. That will get you more information about how interested<br>you are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they<br>offer for ambition.<br>Don't wait. Don't wait till the end of college to figure out what<br>to work on. Don't even wait for internships during college. You<br>don't necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often<br>you can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring<br>out what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve,<br>the sooner you start, the better.<br>One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at<br>who your colleagues will be. You'll become like whoever you work<br>with. Do you want to become like these people?<br>Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work<br>is magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same<br>decisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well<br>it pays, you'll be surrounded by other people who chose it for the<br>same reason, and that will make it even more soul-sucking than it<br>seems from the outside. Whereas if you choose work you're genuinely<br>interested in, you'll be surrounded mostly by other people who are<br>genuinely interested in it, and that will make it extra inspiring.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/when.html#f3n)\]<br>The other thing you do in the face of uncertainty is to make choices<br>that are uncertainty-proof. The less sure you are about what to do,<br>the more important it is to choose options that give you more options<br>in the future. I call this "staying upwind." If you're unsure whether<br>to major in math or economics, for example, choose math; math is<br>upwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch<br>later from math to economics than from economics to math.<br>There's one case, though, where it's easy to say whether you should<br>work on what interests you the most: if you want to do <br>[great work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html).<br>This is not a sufficient condition for doing great work, but it is<br>a necessary one.<br>There's a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to "follow<br>your passion," and this is the reason. Most such advice comes from<br>people who are famously successful, and if you ask someone who's<br>famously successful how to do what they did, most will tell you<br>that you have to work on what you're most interested in. And this<br>is in fact true.<br>That doesn't mean it's the right advice for everyone. Not everyone<br>can do great work, or wants to. But if you do want to, the complicated<br>question of whether or not to work on what interests you the most<br>becomes simple. The answer is yes. The root of great work is a sort<br>of ambitious curiosity, and you can't manufacture that.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>These examples show why it's a mistake to assume that economic<br>inequality must be evidence of some kind of brokenness or unfairness.<br>It's obvious that different people have different interests, and<br>that some interests yield far more money than others, so how can<br>it not be obvious that some people will end up much richer than<br>others? In a world where some people like to write enterprise<br>software and others like to make studio pottery, economic inequality<br>is the natural outcome.<br>\[2\]<br>Difficulty choosing between interests is a different matter.<br>That's not always due to ignorance. It's often intrinsically<br>difficult. I still have trouble doing it.<br>\[3\]<br>You can't always take people at their word on this. Since<br>it's more prestigious to work on things you're interested in than<br>to be driven by money, people who are driven mainly by money will<br>often claim to be more interested in their work than they actually<br>are. One way to test such claims is by doing the following thought<br>experiment: if their work didn't pay well, would they take day jobs<br>doing something else in order to do it in their spare time? Lots<br>of mathematicians and scientists and engineers would. Historically<br>lots _have_. But I don't think as many investment bankers would.<br>This thought experiment is also useful for distinguishing between<br>university departments.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, <br>Jessica Livingston,<br>Robert Morris, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of<br>this. |
