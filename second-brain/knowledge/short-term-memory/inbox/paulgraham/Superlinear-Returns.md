| ![Superlinear Returns](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/superlinear-returns-1.gif)<br>October 2023<br>One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world<br>when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance<br>are superlinear.<br>Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.<br>"You get out," I heard a thousand times, "what you put in." They<br>meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half<br>as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers.<br>You get no customers, and you go out of business.<br>It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear<br>in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if<br>we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear<br>returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact<br>of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power,<br>military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all<br>of these, the rich get richer.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f1n)\]<br>You can't understand the world without understanding the concept<br>of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely<br>should, because this will be the wave you surf on.<br>It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with<br>superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two<br>fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.<br>The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working<br>on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial<br>cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're<br>tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone<br>who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.<br>Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern<br>there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And<br>as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies<br>with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the<br>ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.<br>Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather<br>than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early<br>on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them<br>decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to<br>tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that<br>by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows<br>exponentially.<br>YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate "you get<br>out what you put in," but it's not far from the truth. And if growth<br>rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance<br>_p_ over time _t_ would be proportional to _pt_.<br>Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence<br>startling.<br>Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll<br>get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare<br>us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is<br>surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who<br>asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double<br>the amount each successive day.<br>What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with,<br>but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either,<br>because there have been so few instances of it in human history.<br>In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you<br>had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land<br>was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that<br>exponentially.<br>Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There _was_ a way<br>to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory<br>you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier<br>it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of<br>empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their<br>experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a<br>remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use<br>in one's own life.<br>The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times<br>was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to<br>learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people<br>were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain<br>topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires<br>of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in<br>preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f2n)\]<br>That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of<br>ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But<br>this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated<br>it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from<br>exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances<br>of it.<br>The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression<br>"winner take all." In a sports match the relationship between<br>performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets<br>one win whether they do much better or just slightly better.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f3n)\]<br>The source of the step function is not competition per se, however.<br>It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need<br>competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations<br>where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting<br>a target.<br>It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear<br>returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential<br>growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage,<br>which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential<br>growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects,<br>a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.<br>Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both<br>sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because<br>existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's<br>so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the<br>A-list in the average person's head.<br>The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns<br>may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also<br>thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of<br>these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read,<br>you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important<br>thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge<br>seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the<br>boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole<br>new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new<br>discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and<br>Darwin.<br>Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear<br>returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.<br>There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in<br>the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in<br>the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure,<br>or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching<br>you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting<br>one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You<br>may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning<br>a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.<br>This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People<br>in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only<br>continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But<br>if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't<br>grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should<br>yield results eventually.<br>Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of<br>learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably<br>treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields<br>another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning,<br>you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.<br>But don't overoptimize _what_ you're learning. Don't limit yourself<br>to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're<br>learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable,<br>and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.<br>What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the<br>form "seek thresholds" or "seek competition?" Here the situation<br>is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the<br>game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette,<br>you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the<br>best case you're no better off. "Seek competition" is similarly<br>useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently<br>fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of<br>the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will<br>grow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds<br>only guarantee the shape.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f4n)\]<br>A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a<br>test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if<br>you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it<br>could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes<br>a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd<br>buy a better alternative if you made one.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f5n)\]<br>It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual<br>thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new<br>fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty,<br>but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have<br>predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's<br>hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research<br>problem _isn't_ likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems<br>legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries<br>tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they<br>were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open<br>questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one<br>heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism<br>— to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what<br>you're supposed to.<br>The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting<br>one for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department:<br>this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types<br>of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns<br>themselves are growing.<br>There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined<br>that they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and<br>the decreasing importance of organizations.<br>Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an<br>organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to<br>get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and<br>the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in<br>most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And<br>prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of<br>an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a<br>handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked<br>alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even<br>they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.<br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f6n)\]<br>A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns<br>for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in<br>my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists<br>and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious<br>projects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new<br>ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.<br>There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change<br>has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering<br>what's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change<br>than one in the returns for performance.<br>Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more<br>variation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better<br>off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly<br>will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing<br>oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people<br>will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for<br>superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know<br>they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher<br>variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to<br>risk trying it to find out.<br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f7n)\]<br>The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their<br>current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they'd<br>never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity<br>will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural<br>version the institutions themselves might have cooked up.<br>Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It<br>threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies. \[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f8n)\]<br>But if you're an ambitious individual it's good news for you.<br>How should you take advantage of it?<br>The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for<br>performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of<br>the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because<br>there's less competition at the far end — and not just for the<br>obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well,<br>but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few<br>even try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional<br>work, but a bargain even to try to.<br>There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if<br>you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right.<br>For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be<br>interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with<br>superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're<br>interested in, and to find ways to work on it.<br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f9n)\]<br>It will also be<br>important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example,<br>if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure<br>of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when<br>you're young and don't yet have children.<br>There's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work.<br>It's not just a matter of trying hard. I'm going to take a shot<br>giving a recipe in one paragraph.<br>Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in.<br>Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter<br>what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work<br>as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually<br>bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth<br>from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and<br>explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole<br>new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing<br>occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the<br>best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples.<br>Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep<br>well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your<br>curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's<br>worth paying attention to.<br>\[ [10](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f10n)\]<br>And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck<br>is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're<br>working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And<br>though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where<br>preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component<br>of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is<br>to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking<br>risks early.<br>The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably<br>science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined<br>with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at<br>the limits of knowledge.<br>The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery<br>that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies<br>seem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater<br>than all his contemporaries' combined.<br>\[ [11](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f11n)\]<br>This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell<br>it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return<br>curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.<br>In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality<br>is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of<br>this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform<br>everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same<br>is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.<br>What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else?<br>Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting,<br>directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing.<br>In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds;<br>you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In<br>politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And<br>in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven<br>largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth.<br>But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a<br>remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same<br>as the list of fields where you have to be [independent-minded](https://paulgraham.com/think.html) to<br>succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel<br>as well.<br>\[ [12](https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f12n)\]<br>This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers<br>saying things that other people have already said. But it's just<br>as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that<br>a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone<br>else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will<br>already reflect that, and there's no room to make money.<br>What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have<br>to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at<br>first. _At this rate,_ you find yourself thinking, _I'll never get_<br>_anywhere._ But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far<br>end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.<br>In the startup world, the name for this principle is "do things<br>that don't scale." If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to<br>your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential<br>growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything<br>that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first<br>start learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the<br>initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the<br>easier it will get.<br>There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with<br>superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the<br>20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a<br>result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with<br>having a job. Even now to most people the phrase "your work" means<br>their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever<br>they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their<br>work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they<br>have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of<br>their portfolio.<br>It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big<br>winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately,<br>but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and<br>you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one.<br>Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and<br>interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns<br>if they're not already part of one.<br>The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed,<br>the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both<br>ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity<br>may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you<br>climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting<br>enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.<br>**Notes**<br>There's a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort,<br>performance, and return, because they're not sharply distinguished<br>in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance<br>to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry,<br>they're not meaningless. I've tried to write about them as precisely<br>as I could without crossing into error.<br>\[1\]<br>Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of<br>superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to<br>empathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns.<br>\[2\]<br>Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the<br>Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human<br>life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad,<br>gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few<br>exceptionally learned people.<br>\[3\]<br>It's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as<br>superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a<br>superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort<br>by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the<br>step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after<br>the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one<br>would bother.<br>\[4\]<br>Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that<br>some people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to<br>promising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them<br>promising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring<br>crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by<br>someone quietly working on another one.<br>\[5\]<br>Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When<br>something is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden<br>reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete.<br>Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for<br>deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things<br>that exist for such reasons.<br>\[6\]<br>In my twenties I wanted to be an [artist](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html) <br>and even went to art<br>school to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial<br>part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least<br>at the mercy of organizations.<br>\[7\]<br>In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning<br>compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in<br>practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where<br>the return curve gets really steep.<br>\[8\]<br>It's unclear exactly what advocates of "equity" mean by it.<br>They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is<br>probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power<br>to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than<br>everyone else.<br>It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just<br>the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction,<br>but I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it<br>arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly<br>increasing variation in performance.<br>\[9\]<br>Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something<br>prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in<br>it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.<br>\[10\]<br>The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of<br>" [How to Do Great Work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)." <br>As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear<br>returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its<br>own. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because<br>after I finished "How to Do Great Work" I rewrote it based on that.<br>\[11\]<br>Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually<br>did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful<br>and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist,<br>by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people<br>who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most<br>advanced economies the ratio has [shifted dramatically](https://paulgraham.com/richnow.html) toward discovery<br>just in the last half century.<br>\[12\]<br>It's not surprising that conventional-minded people would<br>dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest<br>drivers of it. But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to<br>have what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine<br>what it's like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great<br>variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they<br>encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some<br>malign external influence.<br>**Thanks** <br>to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Tyler Cowen,<br>Jessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts<br>of this. |
