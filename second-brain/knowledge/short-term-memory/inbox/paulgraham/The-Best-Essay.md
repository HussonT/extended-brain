| ![The Best Essay](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-best-essay-1.gif)<br>March 2024<br>Despite its title this isn't meant to be the best essay. My goal<br>here is to figure out what the best essay would be like.<br>It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic.<br>What made it special would be what it was about.<br>Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably<br>wouldn't be about this year's lipstick colors. But it wouldn't be<br>vaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be<br>surprising. It has to tell people something they don't already know.<br>The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell<br>people something surprising about.<br>That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences.<br>One is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping<br>into a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of<br>natural selection in an essay written in 1844.<br>Talk about an<br>important topic you could tell people something surprising about.<br>If that's the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one<br>written in 1844. <br>And indeed, the best possible essay at any given<br>time would usually be one describing the most important scientific<br>or technological discovery it was possible to make.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f1n)\]<br>Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing<br>this that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best<br>essay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best<br>one you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true.<br>It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this<br>sense. But it wouldn't be impressive to write an essay introducing<br>natural selection now. The best essay _now_ would be one describing<br>a great discovery we didn't yet know about.<br>If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to<br>the question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with<br>the wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we<br>shouldn't waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making<br>discoveries in some specific domain. But I'm interested in essays<br>and what can be done with them, so I want to see if there's some<br>other question I could have asked.<br>There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the<br>one I started with. Instead of asking _what would the best essay_<br>_be?_ I should have asked _how do you write essays well?_ Though<br>these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer<br>to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay<br>writing. The second question forces it to be.<br>Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do<br>you do that well? How do you discover by writing?<br>An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a<br>question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't<br>have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like<br>one in the sense that it spurs some response.<br>How do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to<br>choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it.<br>Professional traders won't even trade unless they have what they<br>call an _edge_ — a convincing story about why in some class of<br>trades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't<br>attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about<br>it or way of approaching it.<br>You don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind<br>of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about<br>something other people take for granted can be edge enough.<br>If you come across a question that's sufficiently puzzling, it could<br>be worth exploring even if it doesn't seem very momentous. Many an<br>important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed<br>insignificant at first. How can they _all_ be finches? <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f2n)\]<br>Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud<br>about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific<br>string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This<br>initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts<br>your ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because<br>once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.<br>Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting<br>with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because<br>this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some<br>specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's<br>wrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay<br>writing is rereading what you've written and asking _is this correct_<br>_and complete?_ You have to be very strict when rereading, not just<br>because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between<br>your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be<br>discovered.<br>The prize for being strict with what you've written is not just<br>refinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make<br>it exactly right, sometimes you find that you can't, and that the<br>reason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when<br>you discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f3n)\]<br>Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step<br>in a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional<br>questions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process<br>continues recursively, as response spurs response. <br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f4n)\]<br>Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which<br>means you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped,<br>which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point.<br>How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the<br>greatest combination of generality and novelty. I don't consciously<br>rank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting;<br>but generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting. <br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f5n)\]<br>If you're willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don't have to guess<br>right. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it<br>isn't good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time.<br>In this essay I've already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition<br>to countless shorter ones. Maybe I'll reattach it at the end, or<br>boil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we'll<br>see. <br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f6n)\]<br>In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous<br>temptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep<br>something that isn't right, just because it contains a few good bits<br>or cost you a lot of effort.<br>The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is<br>_does it really matter what the initial question is?_ If the space<br>of ideas is highly connected, it shouldn't, because you should be<br>able to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a few<br>hops. And we see evidence that it's highly connected in the way,<br>for example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turn<br>any conversation toward it. But that only works if you know where<br>you want to go, and you don't in an essay. That's the whole point.<br>You don't want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all your<br>essays will be about the same thing. <br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f7n)\]<br>The other reason the initial question matters is that you usually<br>feel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don't think about this when<br>I decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality.<br>Sticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I've<br>wandered too far and have to backtrack. But I think this is<br>the optimal solution. You don't want the hunt for novelty and<br>generality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what<br>you get.<br>\[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f8n)\]<br>Since the initial question does constrain you, in the best case it<br>sets an upper bound on the quality of essay you'll write. If you<br>do as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow<br>from the initial question, the initial question itself is the only<br>place where there's room for variation.<br>It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though,<br>because you can't predict where a question will lead. Not if you're<br>doing things right, because doing things right means making<br>discoveries, and by definition you can't predict those. So the way<br>to respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which<br>initial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays<br>are for taking risks.<br>Almost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took some<br>effort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the third<br>paragraph, because any essayist's first impulse on hearing that the<br>best essay couldn't be about x would be to try to write it. But if<br>most questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.<br>Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering<br>how long I've been writing essays, it's alarming how novel that<br>question feels.<br>One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love<br>questions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming<br>counterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three.<br>This essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies there<br>is such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive,<br>though it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essay<br>being better than another. And thinking about how to do something<br>so ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.<br>I like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be just<br>a taste of mine, but there's one aspect of it that probably isn't:<br>to write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested<br>in it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretch<br>for the novel insights that are the raison d'etre of the essay, you<br>have to care.<br>If caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question,<br>then the optimal question varies from person to person. It also<br>means you're more likely to write great essays if you care about a<br>lot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater the<br>probable overlap between the set of things you're curious about and<br>the set of topics that yield great essays.<br>What other qualities would a great initial question have? It's<br>probably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas.<br>And I find it's a good sign if it's one that people think has already<br>been thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I've barely thought<br>about how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. I<br>rarely _choose_ what to write about; I just start thinking about<br>something, and sometimes it turns into an essay.<br>Am I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to be<br>thinking about and instead start working my way through some<br>systematically generated list of topics? That doesn't sound like<br>much fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initial<br>question matters, I should care about it.<br>Perhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whatever<br>pops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into your<br>head is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be the<br>answer, because a mere list of topics wouldn't be any use if you<br>didn't have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you<br>need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't<br>generate those systematically. If only. <br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f9n)\]<br>You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The<br>quality of the ideas that come out of your head depends on what goes<br>in, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.<br>You can't learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning<br>about topics that are very different from one another. When I tell<br>people about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy<br>books about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the<br>topics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps<br>that's actually optimal in this business.<br>You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building<br>things, and by going places and seeing things. I don't think it's<br>important to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who<br>make you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an<br>afternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart<br>people. I know because that's what a block of office hours at Y<br>Combinator consists of.<br>While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes<br>from doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have<br>to solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing,<br>I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have<br>done, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other<br>fields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your<br>time working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was<br>hard.<br>I'm not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to<br>those already doing it. If you've spent all your life so far working<br>on other things, you're already halfway there. Though of course to<br>be good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing<br>you'd probably have spent at least some time doing it.<br>Everything I've said about initial questions applies also to the<br>questions you encounter in writing the essay. They're the same<br>thing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just<br>as every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any<br>technique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good<br>whole essays.<br>At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels<br>like a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn't every<br>answer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you<br>start to feel sated. Once you've covered enough interesting ground,<br>you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just<br>as well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it's<br>not lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be<br>asking the initial question of a new essay.<br>That's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas:<br>the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough<br>starting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. Though<br>if you keep writing essays you'll gradually fix this problem by<br>burning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of<br>essays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.<br>When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You<br>can either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees<br>end to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually<br>it requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously<br>at this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an<br>example of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that<br>the best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in the way the<br>best painting would. This seems surprising enough to be<br>worth investigating further.<br>There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about<br>a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect<br>on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that<br>looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us.<br>But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays<br>teach, and you can't teach people something they already know.<br>Natural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance,<br>but an essay explaining it couldn't have the same effect on us that<br>it would have had on Darwin's contemporaries, precisely because his<br>ideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them.<br>\[ [10](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f10n)\]<br>I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay<br>would be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would<br>contain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally to<br>Aristotle and Feynman. That doesn't seem to be true. But if the<br>best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in this stricter<br>sense, what would it take to write essays that were?<br>The answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreen<br>kind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that<br>its discoveries aren't assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise<br>there will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers.<br>If you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as<br>well, you have to write essays that won't stick — essays that,<br>no matter how good they are, won't become part of what people in<br>the future learn before they read them. <br>\[ [11](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f11n)\]<br>I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about<br>things people never learn. For example, it's a long-established<br>pattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes,<br>and only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them<br>weren't worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you<br>can be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised<br>by it.<br>Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo<br>things — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions,<br>for example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn<br>to avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless<br>topic.<br>Sometimes when we're slow to grasp things it's not just because<br>we're obtuse or in denial but because we've been deliberately lied<br>to. There are a lot of things adults [lie](https://paulgraham.com/lies.html) <br>to kids about, and when<br>you reach adulthood, they don't take you aside and hand you a list<br>of them. They don't remember which lies they told you, and most<br>were implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a source<br>of surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.<br>Sometimes it's systems that lie to you. For example, the educational<br>systems in most countries train you to win by <br>[hacking the test](https://paulgraham.com/lesson.html). But<br>that's not how you win at the most important real-world tests, and<br>after decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the real<br>world to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies will<br>work as long as the institutions remain broken. <br>\[ [12](https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f12n)\]<br>Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers<br>already know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted<br>culturally. "Everyone knows," for example, that it can be rewarding<br>to have [kids](https://paulgraham.com/kids.html). But till you have them you don't know precisely what<br>forms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never<br>have put into words.<br>I've written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn't do it<br>in a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in the<br>stricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one's ideas<br>not sticking suggests that it's not worth making a deliberate attempt<br>to. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, but<br>if you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and future<br>generations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much the<br>better. You've crossed into Darwin territory.<br>Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance of<br>something even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And<br>there are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying to<br>lots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate<br>aim.<br>I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I'm<br>always chasing. But I'm glad I understand where timelessness fits.<br>I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay has<br>been a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to get<br>advice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thing<br>left to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did get<br>advice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that would<br>be nice. But when you step back and ask what's the best you can do<br>short of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns<br>out to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is a<br>function of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get them<br>is by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exacting<br>with the answers.<br>The most striking feature of this map of essay writing are the<br>alternating stripes of inspiration and effort required. The questions<br>depend on inspiration, but the answers can be got by sheer persistence.<br>You don't have to get an answer right the first time, but there's<br>no excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keep<br>rewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility.<br>It's a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I'm rewriting<br>as we speak.<br>But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly<br>on effort, in the limit case it's inspiration that makes the<br>difference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing<br>to get. That pool has no bottom.<br>How to get more questions? That is the most important question of<br>all.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>There might be some resistance to this conclusion on the<br>grounds that some of these discoveries could only be understood by<br>a small number of readers. But you get into all sorts of difficulties<br>if you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide<br>where the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a <br>handful of people sequestered at Los Alamos,<br>could an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.<br>Darwin's 1844 essay was derived from an earlier version written in 1839.<br>Extracts from it were published in 1858.<br>\[2\]<br>When you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor<br>question, that's an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to<br>pay attention to things that matter. So when you're very curious<br>about something random, that could mean you've unconsciously noticed<br>it's less random than it seems.<br>\[3\]<br>Corollary: If you're not intellectually honest, your writing<br>won't just be biased, but also boring, because you'll miss all the<br>ideas you'd have discovered if you pushed for the truth.<br>\[4\]<br>Sometimes this process begins before you start writing.<br>Sometimes you've already figured out the first few things you want<br>to say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide _everything_<br>they want to say, and write this down as an outline before they<br>start writing the essay itself. Maybe that's a good way to get them<br>started — or not, I don't know — but it's antithetical to the<br>spirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less<br>your ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.<br>\[5\]<br>The problem with this type of "greedy" algorithm is that you<br>can end up on a local maximum. If the most valuable question is<br>preceded by a boring one, you'll overlook it. But I can't imagine<br>a better strategy. There's no lookahead except by writing. So use<br>a greedy algorithm and a lot of time.<br>\[6\]<br>I ended up reattaching the first 5 of the 17 paragraphs, and<br>discarding the rest.<br>\[7\]<br>Stephen Fry confessed to making use of this phenomenon when<br>taking exams at Oxford. He had in his head a standard essay about<br>some general literary topic, and he would find a way to turn the<br>exam question toward it and then just reproduce it again.<br>Strictly speaking it's the graph of ideas that would be highly<br>connected, not the space, but that usage would confuse people who<br>don't know graph theory, whereas people who do know it will get<br>what I mean if I say "space".<br>\[8\]<br>Too far doesn't depend just on the distance from the original<br>topic. It's more like that distance divided by the value of whatever<br>I've discovered in the subtree.<br>\[9\]<br>Or can you? I should try writing about this. Even if the<br>chance of succeeding is small, the expected value is huge.<br>\[10\]<br>There was a vogue in the 20th century for saying that the<br>purpose of art was also to teach. Some artists tried to justify<br>their work by explaining that their goal was not to produce something<br>good, but to challenge our preconceptions about art. And to be fair,<br>art can teach somewhat. The ancient Greeks' naturalistic sculptures<br>represented a new idea, and must have been extra exciting to<br>contemporaries on that account. But they still look good to us.<br>\[11\]<br>Bertrand Russell caused huge controversy in the early 20th<br>century with his ideas about "trial marriage." But they make boring<br>reading now, because they prevailed. "Trial marriage" is what we<br>call "dating."<br>\[12\]<br>If you'd asked me 10 years ago, I'd have predicted that schools<br>would continue to teach hacking the test for centuries. But now it<br>seems plausible that students will soon be taught individually by<br>AIs, and that exams will be replaced by ongoing, invisible<br>micro-assessments.<br>**Thanks** to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, <br>Jessica Livingston, Robert<br>Morris, Courtenay Pipkin, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of<br>this. |
