| ![How to Do Great Work](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-do-great-work-2.gif)<br>July 2023<br>If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot<br>of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided<br>to find out by making it.<br>Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone<br>working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the<br>intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does<br>have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled "work hard."<br>The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.<br>The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose<br>needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a<br>natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that<br>offers scope to do great work.<br>In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion.<br>Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it.<br>So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for<br>and great interest in.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f1n)\]<br>That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When<br>you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different<br>kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not<br>even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at<br>14, most have to figure it out.<br>The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not<br>sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going.<br>You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's<br>good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries<br>come from noticing connections between different fields.<br>Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let "work"<br>mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do<br>great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.<br>It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your<br>part of it.<br>What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly<br>ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves,<br>exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly<br>ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach<br>yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered<br>questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.<br>There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the<br>rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let<br>it have its way, will also show you what to work on.<br>What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that<br>would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.<br>Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the<br>next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the<br>frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a<br>distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get<br>close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.<br>The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because<br>your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler<br>model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions<br>about things that everyone else took for granted. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f2n)\]<br>If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often<br>has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math.<br>It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears,<br>embrace it.<br>Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested<br>in them — in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited<br>about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have<br>enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking,<br>that's as good a bet as you'll find.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f3n)\]<br>Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier,<br>notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone<br>who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.<br>Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible<br>to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the<br>empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.<br>That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply<br>interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere<br>diligence ever could.<br>The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the<br>desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and<br>that combination is the most powerful of all.<br>The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack<br>in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world<br>inside.<br>Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring<br>out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't<br>tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which<br>means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for<br>years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at<br>it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning<br>about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose<br>late based on very incomplete information.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f4n)\]<br>The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in<br>two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that<br>grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the<br>more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what<br>to do.<br>The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They<br>expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what<br>it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal<br>trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.<br>It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted<br>that the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what<br>to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow<br>magically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will:<br>when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own.<br>Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will<br>find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on<br>the assumption that everyone does.<br>What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know<br>what to work on? What you should _not_ do is drift along passively,<br>assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action.<br>But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read<br>biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how<br>much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result<br>of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.<br>So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to<br>do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people,<br>read lots of books, ask lots of questions.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f5n)\]<br>When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you<br>learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very<br>different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need<br>to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're<br>like. But a field should become _increasingly_ interesting as you<br>learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.<br>Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than<br>other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the<br>better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste<br>for work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find<br>new things if you're looking where few have looked before.<br>One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like<br>even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.<br>But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the<br>course of working on one thing you discover another that's more<br>exciting, don't be afraid to switch.<br>If you're making something for people, make sure it's something<br>they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something<br>you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool<br>you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests,<br>this will also get you your initial audience.<br>This _should_ follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most<br>exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason<br>I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong.<br>Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some<br>imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down<br>that route, you're lost.<br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f6n)\]<br>There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're<br>trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion,<br>fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But<br>if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof<br>against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.<br>Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy,<br>but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of<br>obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it<br>does take a good deal of boldness.<br>But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning.<br>In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard<br>on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of<br>it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try<br>to preserve certain invariants.<br>The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements<br>you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich<br>by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal,<br>but you can't discover natural selection that way.<br>I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy<br>is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most<br>interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call<br>this approach "staying upwind." This is how most people who've done<br>great work seem to have done it.<br>Even when you've found something exciting to work on, working on<br>it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new<br>idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to<br>work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't<br>like that.<br>You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.<br>There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a<br>technique to working, just as there is to sailing.<br>For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too<br>hard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns:<br>fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health.<br>The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the<br>type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for<br>four or five hours a day.<br>Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try<br>to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in.<br>You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.<br>It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.<br>You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial<br>threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a<br>flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both<br>per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the<br>sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's<br>ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over<br>it.<br>It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great<br>work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't. When I'm<br>reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by<br>saying "I'll just read over what I've got so far." Five minutes<br>later I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and<br>I'm off.<br>Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie<br>to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example.<br>Lots of great things began with someone saying "How hard could it<br>be?"<br>This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more<br>optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism<br>is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.<br>Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be<br>more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise<br>in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best<br>work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.<br>Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what<br>you're working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you<br>discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after<br>all.<br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f7n)\]<br>Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per<br>project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project<br>procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting<br>that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't<br>quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can<br>get a lot not done.<br>\[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f8n)\]<br>One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it<br>usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around<br>doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So<br>per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day<br>procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.<br>The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I<br>working on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok<br>if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous<br>as you get older.<br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f9n)\]<br>Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people<br>an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of<br>this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the<br>work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.<br>There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years<br>at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not<br>how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently<br>on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take<br>stock, you're surprised how far you've come.<br>The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative<br>effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but<br>if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key:<br>consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every<br>day. They get something done, rather than nothing.<br>If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most<br>people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to<br>think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon:<br>the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more.<br>Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more<br>new fans they'll bring you.<br>The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat<br>in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential<br>curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential<br>growth in its early stages.<br>Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's<br>worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since<br>we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done<br>unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase<br>of learning something new because they know from experience that<br>learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their<br>audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do.<br>If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential<br>growth, many more would do it.<br>Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of<br>undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying<br>in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a<br>little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by<br>frontal attack.<br>You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this<br>phenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The<br>daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds<br>it questions.<br>\[ [10](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f10n)\]<br>Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important<br>to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your<br>mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that<br>moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out<br>of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on<br>the distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)<br>Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field.<br>Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't<br>know what you're aiming for.<br>And that _is_ what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to<br>be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made<br>by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth<br>thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a<br>phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where<br>almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short.<br>Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively<br>different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is<br>simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.<br>\[ [11](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f11n)\]<br>Fortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might<br>seem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the<br>best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It's exciting, and<br>also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it's<br>easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.<br>One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will<br>care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter<br>more than your contemporaries', but because something that still<br>seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.<br>Don't try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best<br>job you can; you won't be able to help doing it in a distinctive<br>way.<br>Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying<br>to is affectation.<br>Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is<br>doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while<br>you're pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows<br>in the work.<br>\[ [12](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f12n)\]<br>The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They<br>often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that<br>problem, because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently<br>ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're<br>not a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work and<br>your identity will take care of itself.<br>"Avoid affectation" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how<br>would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to<br>be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're<br>earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar<br>vices.<br>The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're<br>taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind<br>of sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new<br>ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're<br>trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can<br>you have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?<br>One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight<br>positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing<br>to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken<br>about something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it.<br>\[ [13](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f13n)\]<br>Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality.<br>Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative<br>name implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means<br>focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.<br>What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as<br>doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing<br>it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being<br>good. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work:<br>they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's<br>basically the definition of a nerd.<br>Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need<br>in doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood.<br>So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than<br>the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms<br>of them. "It's easy to criticize" is true in the most literal sense,<br>and the route to great work is never easy.<br>There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and<br>pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it's an advantage to<br>be optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a<br>fool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The<br>Old Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a<br>fool. But that's advice for _seeming_ smart. If you actually want<br>to discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling<br>people your ideas.<br>Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a<br>conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I<br>doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest.<br>It's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin<br>for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected,<br>intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool.<br>\[ [14](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f14n)\]<br>Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself.<br>It's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle<br>of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.<br>You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily<br>have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some<br>effort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias<br>and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat<br>this ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert<br>to what I have now?<br>Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit<br>just because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of<br>effort.<br>Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're<br>doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll<br>understand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about<br>whether there's anything real there.<br>Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from<br>the arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term "elegant"<br>applied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior — <br>that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical<br>elegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math.<br>Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will<br>often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of<br>effort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people,<br>at least temporarily.<br>Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively<br>little effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn't<br>have to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard<br>to say whether you're creating something or discovering it.<br>When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or<br>discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself<br>as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.<br>(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem<br>to work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case<br>it's more like creating something. In the best case you create the<br>field in the process of exploring it.)<br>Similarly, if you're trying to build a powerful tool, make it<br>gratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition<br>will be used in ways you didn't expect, so err on the side of<br>eliminating restrictions, even if you don't know what the benefit<br>will be.<br>Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something<br>others build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that<br>others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer.<br>The best ideas have implications in many different areas.<br>If you express your ideas in the most general form, they'll be truer<br>than you intended.<br>True by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be<br>true and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new<br>ideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers<br>of knowledge.<br>In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity,<br>and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name,<br>because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible<br>to have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great<br>deal of what's often called _technical_ ability — and yet not have<br>much of this.<br>I've never liked the term "creative process." It seems misleading.<br>Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers<br>throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle<br>grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.<br>If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand<br>very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most<br>original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got<br>divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15<br>year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see<br>originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all<br>the more clear.<br>I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there<br>are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For<br>example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're<br>working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have<br>original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something<br>slightly too difficult.<br>\[ [15](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f15n)\]<br>Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good<br>way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a<br>missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you.<br>Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.<br>Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll<br>often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often<br>dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit.<br>Sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk.<br>\[ [16](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f16n)\]<br>It also helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas<br>if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives<br>the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because<br>analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.<br>Don't divide your attention _evenly_ between many topics though,<br>or you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it<br>according to something more like a power law.<br>\[ [17](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f17n)\]<br>Be professionally<br>curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.<br>Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds<br>originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship<br>is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality;<br>it's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since<br>questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity<br>at its best is a creative force.<br>Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of<br>seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a<br>new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this<br>before?<br>When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably<br>a good one.<br>Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having<br>new ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction?<br>It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the<br>way you look at the world. We see the world through models that<br>both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas<br>become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard.<br>That's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover:<br>they're easy to see after you do something hard.<br>One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other<br>people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where<br>they bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these<br>clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached<br>to their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend<br>to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous<br>it may seem in retrospect.<br>To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead<br>of looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the<br>wild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was<br>looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.<br>The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical<br>as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps<br>to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the<br>point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially<br>shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.<br>Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new<br>ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem<br>perfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world<br>they brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the<br>greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally<br>accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.<br>Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to<br>most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what<br>you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of<br>crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often<br>ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of<br>crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas<br>ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.<br>There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy<br>breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases<br>being aggressively and passively independent-minded.<br>The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules<br>don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional<br>energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of<br>a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it<br>started.<br>The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps<br>even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often<br>make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts<br>as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies<br>also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs.<br>Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.<br>Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination.<br>In popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken<br>model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial<br>ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking _are_<br>opposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers<br>can be truly strict.<br>An overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do<br>see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious<br>shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much<br>work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if<br>you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.<br>One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for _someone_<br>_else_ to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to<br>protect you.<br>You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other<br>direction: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished<br>but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable<br>ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.<br>Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So<br>anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically<br>as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow.<br>Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.<br>\[ [18](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f18n)\]<br>What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being<br>too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident<br>as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?<br>People show much more originality in solving problems than in<br>deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly<br>conservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream<br>of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on<br>fashionable problems.<br>One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than<br>solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy<br>you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But<br>even so I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely<br>responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems<br>are undervalued.<br>One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the<br>problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't.<br>Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its<br>latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're<br>interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let<br>their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.<br>Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's<br>no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied<br>elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And<br>there's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that<br>would otherwise be wasted.<br>But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly<br>unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't<br>seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these?<br>By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way,<br>and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head<br>that says you should only be working on "important" problems.<br>You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is<br>too conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important<br>but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already<br>on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you<br>were going to take a break from "serious" work to work on something<br>just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The<br>answer is probably more important than it seems.<br>Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than<br>originality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people<br>who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the<br>initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key<br>to the whole game.<br>Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas<br>is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition.<br>People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was<br>in the question.<br>Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used<br>in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being<br>answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can<br>be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery.<br>How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to<br>earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By<br>even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel<br>territory.<br>Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around<br>with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of<br>noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing<br>that two unanswered questions are the same.<br>Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often<br>comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before<br>— in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about.<br>People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful<br>dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful<br>questions alive.<br>\[ [19](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f19n)\]<br>This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from<br>the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are<br>certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long<br>as (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else<br>understands them either.<br>Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea<br>is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled<br>about something. Which means that originality consists partly of<br>puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with<br>the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them,<br>but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them.<br>\[ [20](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f20n)\]<br>It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is<br>one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best<br>way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones.<br>Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.<br>The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread<br>protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it<br>just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be<br>obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict<br>that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to<br>predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.<br>It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on<br>a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The<br>initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side<br>projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start<br>lots of small things.<br>Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try,<br>the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand,<br>though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things<br>that don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also<br>having a lot of bad ones.<br>\[ [21](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f21n)\]<br>Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything<br>that's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by<br>trying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you<br>do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when<br>starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like<br>two puzzle pieces.<br>How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By<br>making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in<br>successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it,<br>and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than<br>anything you could have planned.<br>It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're<br>making something for people — to get an initial version in front<br>of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.<br>Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work.<br>Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn't, this will at least get<br>you started.<br>Don't try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There<br>are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long<br>to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are<br>both merely instances of a more general principle.<br>An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a<br>toy. It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has<br>everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow.<br>\[ [22](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f22n)\]<br>The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it<br>is to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does<br>usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized<br>to say "we're going to do x and then y and then z" than "we're going<br>to try x and see what happens." And it is more _organized_; it just<br>doesn't work as well.<br>Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a<br>necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something<br>you have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or<br>because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If<br>you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to<br>plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.<br>Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk<br>is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a<br>bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally,<br>you're probably being too conservative.<br>Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the<br>young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear<br>risk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most.<br>Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working<br>on it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and<br>encountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably<br>no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying<br>to do something slightly too hard.<br>Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages<br>of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy,<br>time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge,<br>efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of<br>the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.<br>The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they<br>have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest<br>is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time.<br>The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly<br>frivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know<br>about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just<br>because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.<br>That "slightly" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly<br>when you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference<br>between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing<br>something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet,<br>and possibly a better one than you think.<br>\[ [23](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f23n)\]<br>The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience,<br>is that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain<br>embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit<br>together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but<br>occasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly<br>and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the<br>idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not<br>to.<br>\[ [24](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f24n)\]<br>So when you're learning about something for the first time, pay<br>attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You'll be tempted<br>to ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you.<br>And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep<br>progressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further<br>into the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If<br>they're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they<br>probably represent an undiscovered idea.<br>One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience<br>is to know what you _don't_ have to worry about. The young know all<br>the things that could matter, but not their relative importance.<br>So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much<br>more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.<br>But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience.<br>The other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at<br>adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you've<br>acquired and false things you've been taught — and you won't be<br>able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in<br>the way of whatever type of work you want to do.<br>Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools.<br>We're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school<br>as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of<br>strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.<br>For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child,<br>there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you<br>what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither<br>classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts<br>of the way schools are usually designed.<br>The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still<br>in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your<br>teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem<br>a stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's<br>the truth economically, and in the best case it's the truth<br>intellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your<br>bosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source<br>of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.<br>Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like.<br>In school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost<br>always soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In<br>real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you<br>often don't know if they're soluble at all.<br>But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win<br>by hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You<br>can't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way<br>to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others<br>have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.<br>Don't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you<br>a "big break." Even if this were true, the best way to get it would<br>be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential<br>people.<br>And don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that<br>impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different<br>from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection<br>committees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of<br>a feedback loop, and very few are.<br>People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing<br>inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how<br>something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does<br>copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the<br>presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.<br>There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy<br>something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still,<br>unconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed<br>phrase "Great artists steal." The really dangerous kind of copying,<br>the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done<br>without realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train<br>running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other<br>extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.<br>\[ [25](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f25n)\]<br>In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be<br>in some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a<br>vacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're<br>first starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're<br>going to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once<br>you're established, you can react to your own. But while the former<br>gets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two<br>cases are more similar than they seem.<br>Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes<br>makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New<br>discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of<br>existing things, _even by their discoverers_, because there isn't<br>yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.<br>There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that<br>you'll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at<br>the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.<br>And when you do copy something, don't copy every feature of it.<br>Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don't copy the manner of<br>an eminent 50 year old professor if you're 18, for example, or the<br>idiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.<br>Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded<br>despite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the<br>most likely to be the flaws.<br>This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are<br>jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that<br>being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented<br>is merely how they get away with it.<br>One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from<br>one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries<br>of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by<br>deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas<br>from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.<br>Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you<br>can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things<br>done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's<br>missing.<br>If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one<br>place, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will<br>increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people<br>are human, increase your self-confidence.<br>\[ [26](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f26n)\]<br>If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you<br>might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy<br>to talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're<br>really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's<br>interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their<br>hobbies.<br>It may take some effort to find the people who are really good,<br>though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places,<br>particularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone<br>is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities<br>can't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in<br>different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people<br>doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.<br>Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't<br>be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's<br>good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.<br>Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect<br>you. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.<br>Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better<br>to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good<br>ones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from<br>history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests<br>that one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great<br>work and not.<br>How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my<br>experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure,<br>you probably don't. But it may be possible to give a more concrete<br>answer than that. Here's an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues<br>offer _surprising_ insights. They can see and do things that you<br>can't. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep<br>you on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.<br>Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some<br>projects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those<br>is not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you'll<br>have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and<br>interest like any other kind of work. If you don't have them, there<br>is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management<br>as a second language, or avoid such projects.<br>\[ [27](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f27n)\]<br>Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working<br>on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a<br>living organism.<br>Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great<br>work if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of<br>yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.<br>Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If<br>you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a<br>refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism,<br>it's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by<br>some of the greatest minds in history.<br>Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which<br>increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this<br>cycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing<br>good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since<br>it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right<br>direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when<br>you're stuck, just so you start to get something done.<br>One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow<br>setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.<br>You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering<br>setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always<br>involves some backtracking.<br>Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the<br>desire to. So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't<br>quite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either<br>try again, or backtrack and then try again.<br>"Never give up" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times<br>when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would<br>be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you<br>need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.<br>It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more<br>than it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends<br>how fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from<br>bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.<br>An audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar,<br>your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience<br>in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big.<br>The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with<br>its size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if<br>you're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated<br>audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people<br>genuinely love what you're doing, that's enough.<br>To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between<br>you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable,<br>but it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off<br>switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.<br>\[ [28](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f28n)\]<br>The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your<br>morale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and<br>others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always<br>what you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and<br>avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there's someone<br>you need to take care of, that takes precedence.<br>Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work,<br>or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're<br>ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition;<br>so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you,<br>or does and doesn't care.<br>Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's<br>important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly,<br>eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of<br>drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise<br>because they're good for thinking.<br>\[ [29](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f29n)\]<br>People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone<br>else, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. In fact,<br>if you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous _not_ to be productive.<br>People who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to<br>become bitter.<br>It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people.<br>The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the<br>opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just<br>adds noise.<br>The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and<br>sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough,<br>you'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of<br>work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.<br>Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose<br>the problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing<br>something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors<br>make you do anything much more specific than work harder.<br>Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows<br>more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.<br>Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the<br>secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single<br>word, my bet would be on "curiosity."<br>That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to<br>be curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can<br>nurture it and let it drive you.<br>Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will<br>choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to<br>notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole<br>process is a kind of dance with curiosity.<br>Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could.<br>But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it<br>this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so<br>you're already further along than you might realize, because the<br>set of people willing to want to is small.<br>The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal,<br>mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and<br>luck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can<br>ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to<br>do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest.<br>Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will<br>combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?<br>Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different<br>ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered.<br>Out of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited<br>for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close<br>match. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your<br>ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by<br>trying.<br>Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds<br>them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous<br>to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if<br>you tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation<br>is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do<br>great work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy<br>away from the question.<br>So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great<br>work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that.<br>I wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know<br>you're interested.<br>Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone.<br>And if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have<br>worse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst<br>problem you have.<br>Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to<br>work hard. And if you're working on something you find very<br>interesting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path,<br>the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your<br>peers'.<br>The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>I don't think you could give a precise definition of what<br>counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important<br>so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But<br>there's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree, and<br>often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused<br>on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether<br>they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and<br>leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.<br>\[2\]<br>A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in<br>everyday life. "Did you ever notice...?" New ideas come from doing<br>this about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people's<br>reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!<br>\[3\]<br>That second qualifier is critical. If you're excited about<br>something most authorities discount, but you can't give a more<br>precise explanation than "they don't get it," then you're starting<br>to drift into the territory of cranks.<br>\[4\]<br>Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding<br>a match between the current version of you and a list of known<br>problems. You'll often have to coevolve with the problem. That's<br>why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The<br>search space is huge. It's the cartesian product of all possible<br>types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible<br>future versions of you.<br>There's no way you could search this whole space, so you have to<br>rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope<br>the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be;<br>different types of work have been collected together as much by<br>accidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.<br>\[5\]<br>There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do<br>great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide<br>net, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in the<br>first place.<br>\[6\]<br>It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you<br>feel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk<br>down to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it<br>in a sufficiently cynical way, but it's not the route to great work.<br>Not that anyone using this m.o. would care.<br>\[7\]<br>This idea I learned from Hardy's _A Mathematician's Apology_,<br>which I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any<br>field.<br>\[8\]<br>Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate<br>what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done<br>by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by<br>procrastinating for several years.<br>\[9\]<br>You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want,<br>especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work<br>close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for<br>doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side.<br>Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your<br>work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight<br>to get time to do it.<br>\[10\]<br>If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax<br>cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and<br>that you walk to and from.<br>\[11\]<br>There may be some very unworldly people who do great work<br>without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to<br>cover that case, it becomes: Don't try to be anything except the<br>best.<br>\[12\]<br>This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the<br>goal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it's possible to be<br>affected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid<br>_unintentional_ affectation.<br>\[13\]<br>It's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable<br>if and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe<br>to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under<br>the law, because a sentence with a "should" in it isn't really a<br>statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And<br>if there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles,<br>there can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve<br>it.<br>\[14\]<br>Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty.<br>Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in<br>time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.<br>\[15\]<br>Obviously you don't have to be working at the exact moment<br>you have the idea, but you'll probably have been working fairly<br>recently.<br>\[16\]<br>Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I'm<br>skeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.<br>\[17\]<br>For example you might give the nth most important topic<br>(m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m > 1. You couldn't allocate<br>your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an<br>idea of a reasonable distribution.<br>\[18\]<br>The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken.<br>Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to<br>distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.<br>\[19\]<br>It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of<br>questions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you're<br>now in a position to do something about some of them.<br>\[20\]<br>The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a<br>strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain<br>than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand<br>in disputes, even though they're generally stupider.<br>> The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br>> <br>>  Are full of passionate intensity.<br>\[21\]<br>Derived from Linus Pauling's "If you want to have good ideas,<br>you must have many ideas."<br>\[22\]<br>Attacking a project as a "toy" is similar to attacking a<br>statement as "inappropriate." It means that no more substantial<br>criticism can be made to stick.<br>\[23\]<br>One way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if<br>you're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely<br>to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where<br>you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than<br>playing games where you don't.<br>\[24\]<br>Another related advantage is that if you haven't said anything<br>publicly yet, you won't be biased toward evidence that supports<br>your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve<br>eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people,<br>having previously published opinions has an effect similar to<br>ideology, just in quantity 1.<br>\[25\]<br>In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta<br>Maria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted<br>his own version to show how much better he was.<br>\[26\]<br>I'm being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of<br>this writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that<br>are hard to duplicate, but that could change.<br>\[27\]<br>This is false when the work the other people have to do is<br>very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible<br>to expand the area in which it's false by defining similarly<br>restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.<br>\[28\]<br>Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around<br>intermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably<br>a good idea.<br>\[29\]<br>It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because<br>that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and<br>there is some historical evidence for it.<br>**Thanks** <br>to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Pam Graham, Tom Howard,<br>Patrick Hsu, Steve Huffman, Jessica Livingston, Henry Lloyd-Baker,<br>Bob Metcalfe, Ben Miller, Robert Morris, Michael Nielsen, Courtenay<br>Pipkin, Joris Poort, Mieke Roos, Rajat Suri, Harj Taggar, Garry<br>Tan, and my younger son for suggestions and for reading drafts. |
