This was easy<br>to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same<br>popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of<br>football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the<br>kids with mild cases of Down's Syndrome, what in the language of<br>the time we called "retards."<br>We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking<br>physically different. We were not being especially candid to grade<br>ourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise.<br>Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was,<br>including us.<br>My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived;<br>I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground<br>newspaper. So I've seen a good part of the popularity landscape.<br>I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell<br>the same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart<br>and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between<br>being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to _make_ you<br>unpopular.<br>Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question to<br>ask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange to<br>imagine that it could be any other way. But it could. Being smart<br>doesn't make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm<br>you in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problem<br>so bad in most other countries. But in a typical American secondary<br>school, being smart is likely to make your life difficult. Why?<br>The key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why<br>don't smart kids make themselves popular? If they're so smart, why<br>don't they figure out how popularity works and beat the system,<br>just as they do for standardized tests?<br>One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart<br>kids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart,<br>and nothing they could do could make them popular. I wish. If the<br>other kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great job<br>of concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were really an<br>enviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The guys that<br>guys envy, girls like.<br>In the schools I went to, being smart just didn't matter much. Kids<br>didn't admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, they<br>would have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the<br>dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical<br>appearance, charisma, or athletic ability.<br>So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are<br>smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that<br>they don't really want to be popular.<br>If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at<br>him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of them<br>so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn't<br>want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of<br>thirst in a desert that he didn't want a glass of water. Of course<br>I wanted to be popular.<br>But in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted<br>more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that<br>counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write<br>well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to<br>make great things.<br>At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them<br>against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart<br>was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be<br>the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of<br>average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it.<br>Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don't think many<br>nerds would. To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable.<br>But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would be<br>a step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming,<br>as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who<br>wouldn't drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired<br>by everyone?<br>And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve two<br>masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even<br>more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in<br>your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an<br>American secondary school.<br>Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that<br>"no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you<br>want to excel in it."<br>I wonder if anyone in the world works harder<br>at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs<br>and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They<br>occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American<br>teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a<br>year.<br>I don't mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them truly<br>are little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagers<br>are always on duty as conformists.<br>For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes.<br>They don't consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good.<br>But to who? To the other kids. Other kids' opinions become their<br>definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything<br>they do, right down to the way they walk. And so every effort they<br>make to do things "right" is also, consciously or not, an effort<br>to be more popular.<br>Nerds don't realize this. They don't realize that it takes work to<br>be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field<br>don't realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though<br>often unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider<br>the ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall.<br>In fact, most people who "can draw" like drawing, and have spent<br>many hours doing it; that's why they're good at it. Likewise, popular<br>isn't just something you are or you aren't, but something you make<br>yourself.<br>The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things<br>to think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the natural<br>world, not fashions and parties. They're like someone trying to<br>play soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Other<br>players who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them<br>effortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable.<br>Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being<br>popular would be more work for them. The popular kids learned to<br>be popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned<br>to be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents. While the<br>nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids<br>were being trained to please.<br>So far I've been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd,<br>using them as if they were interchangeable. In fact it's only the<br>context that makes them so. A nerd is someone who isn't socially<br>adept enough. But "enough" depends on where you are. In a typical<br>American school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least,<br>so specific) that you don't have to be especially awkward to look<br>awkward by comparison.<br>Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires.<br>Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or<br>siblings of popular kids, they'll tend to become nerds. And that's<br>why smart people's lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven<br>and seventeen. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity<br>than before or after.<br>Before that, kids' lives are dominated by their parents, not by<br>other kids. Kids do care what their peers think in elementary school,<br>but this isn't their whole life, as it later becomes.<br>Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their<br>family as a day job. They create a new world among themselves, and<br>standing in this world is what matters, not standing in their family.<br>Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the<br>world they care about.<br>The problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is at<br>first a very crude one. If you leave a bunch of eleven-year-olds<br>to their own devices, what you get is _Lord of the Flies._ Like<br>a lot of American kids, I read this book in school. Presumably it<br>was not a coincidence. Presumably someone wanted to point out to<br>us that we were savages, and that we had made ourselves a cruel and<br>stupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemed<br>entirely believable, I didn't get the additional message. I wish<br>they had just told us outright that we were savages and our world<br>was stupid.<br>Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely<br>caused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school<br>is to be actively persecuted.<br>Why? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a<br>strange question to ask. How could things be any other way? But<br>they could be. Adults don't normally persecute nerds. Why do teenage<br>kids do it?<br>Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many<br>children are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the<br>same reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a<br>conscience, torture is amusing.<br>Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel<br>better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water<br>down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own<br>position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think<br>rank below. I've read that this is why poor whites in the United<br>States are the group most hostile to blacks.<br>But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's<br>part of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially<br>about individual attractiveness. It's much more about alliances.<br>To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that<br>bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people<br>closer than a common enemy.<br>Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at<br>home, you can create an enemy if there isn't a real one. By singling<br>out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the<br>hierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider<br>makes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying<br>happen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from<br>a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.<br>If it's any consolation to the nerds, it's nothing personal. The<br>group of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same<br>thing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together<br>to go hunting. They don't actually hate you. They just need something<br>to chase.<br>Because they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target<br>for the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular<br>kids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things.<br>Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous<br>middle classes.<br>The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of<br>popularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear.<br>The least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only<br>D table in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who want<br>to pick on nerds than there are nerds.<br>As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids,<br>one loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that<br>in high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking<br>to them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity<br>is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still<br>ostracize them in self-defense.<br>It's no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle<br>school and high school. Their other interests leave them little<br>attention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles<br>a zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole<br>school. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens<br>without any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the<br>situation.<br>For me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new<br>and harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate<br>the smarter kids had barely begun. Nearly everyone I've talked to<br>agrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen.<br>In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteen<br>for me. There was a brief sensation that year when one of our<br>teachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, and<br>was so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to an<br>eloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another.<br>It didn't have any noticeable effect. What struck me at the time<br>was that she was surprised. You mean she doesn't know the kind of<br>things they say to one another? You mean this isn't normal?<br>It's important to realize that, no, the adults don't know what the<br>kids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, that<br>kids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the<br>abstract that people get tortured in poorer countries. But, like<br>us, they don't like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don't<br>see evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it.<br>Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison<br>wardens. Wardens' main concern is to keep the prisoners on the<br>premises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible<br>prevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to<br>have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave<br>them to create whatever social organization they want. From what<br>I've read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage,<br>and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.<br>In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The most<br>important thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the<br>authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort<br>to teach you something. But beyond that they didn't want to have<br>too much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers<br>mostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture we<br>created was barbaric.<br>Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It might seem that<br>the answer is simply that it's populated by adults, who are too<br>mature to pick on one another. But I don't think this is true.<br>Adults in prison certainly pick on one another. And so, apparently,<br>do society wives; in some parts of Manhattan, life for women sounds<br>like a continuation of high school, with all the same petty intrigues.<br>I think the important thing about the real world is not that it's<br>populated by adults, but that it's very large, and the things you<br>do have real effects. That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch<br>all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little<br>bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect.<br>Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no<br>function for their form to follow.<br>When the things you do have real effects, it's no longer enough<br>just to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right<br>answers, and that's where nerds show to advantage. Bill Gates will<br>of course come to mind. Though notoriously lacking in social skills,<br>he gets the right answers, at least as measured in revenue.<br>The other thing that's different about the real world is that it's<br>much larger. In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities<br>can achieve a critical mass if they clump together. Out in the real<br>world, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societies<br>where intelligence is the most important thing. Sometimes the current<br>even starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularly<br>in university math and science departments, nerds deliberately<br>exaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter. John Nash<br>so admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching the<br>wall as he walked down a corridor.<br>As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn't have much more experience of<br>the world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little<br>world we lived in was, I thought, _the world._ The world seemed cruel<br>and boring, and I'm not sure which was worse.<br>Because I didn't fit into this world, I thought that something must<br>be wrong with me. I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't<br>fit in was that in some ways<br>we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about<br>the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending<br>all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the<br>others.<br>We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into<br>middle school. He wouldn't know the right clothes to wear, the right<br>music to like, the right slang to use. He'd seem to the kids a<br>complete alien. The thing is, he'd know enough not to care what<br>they thought. We had no such confidence.<br>A lot of people seem to think it's good for smart kids to be thrown<br>together with "normal" kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps.<br>But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don't fit in really<br>is that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience<br>at a "pep rally" at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders<br>threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn<br>to pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal<br>ritual.<br>If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice,<br>the main thing I'd tell him would be to stick his head up and look<br>around. I didn't really grasp it at the time, but the whole world<br>we lived in was as fake as a Twinkie. Not just school, but the<br>entire town. Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! So no<br>wonder it seemed boring and sterile. The whole place was a giant<br>nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of<br>breeding children.<br>Where I grew up, it felt as if there was nowhere to go, and nothing<br>to do. This was no accident. Suburbs are deliberately designed to<br>exclude the outside world, because it contains things that could<br>endanger children.<br>And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this<br>fake world. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In<br>fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one<br>place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And<br>I have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society,<br>it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.<br>What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that<br>(a) they aren't told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly<br>by the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing<br>meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run<br>after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing<br>in the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they're<br>called misfits.<br>Life in this twisted world is stressful for the kids. And not just<br>for the nerds. Like any war, it's damaging even to the winners.<br>Adults can't avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So why<br>don't they do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty.<br>The reason kids are so unhappy, adults tell themselves, is that<br>monstrous new chemicals, _hormones_, are now coursing through their<br>bloodstream and messing up everything. There's nothing wrong with<br>the system; it's just inevitable that kids will be miserable at<br>that age.<br>This idea is so pervasive that even the kids believe it, which<br>probably doesn't help. Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurt<br>is not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearing<br>the wrong size shoes.<br>I'm suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are<br>intrinsically messed up. If it's physiological, it should be<br>universal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I've read<br>a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference<br>to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century.<br>Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful<br>and eager. They got in fights and played tricks on one another of<br>course (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but they<br>weren't crazy.<br>As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager<br>is coeval with suburbia. I don't think this is a coincidence. I<br>think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they're made to lead.<br>Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers<br>now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the<br>idle everywhere.<br>When I was in school, suicide was a constant topic among the smarter<br>kids. No one I knew did it, but several planned to, and<br>some may have tried. Mostly this was just a pose. Like other<br>teenagers, we loved the dramatic, and suicide seemed very dramatic.<br>But partly it was because our lives were at times genuinely miserable.<br>Bullying was only part of the problem. Another problem, and possibly<br>an even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on.<br>Humans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity.<br>And all the work we did was <br>[pointless](https://paulgraham.com/essay.html), or seemed so at the time.<br>At best it was practice for real work we might do far in the future,<br>so far that we didn't even know at the time what we were practicing<br>for. More often it was just an arbitrary series of hoops to jump<br>through, words without content designed mainly for testability.<br>(The three main causes of the Civil War were....<br>Test: List the three main causes of the Civil War.)<br>And there was no way to opt out. The adults had agreed among<br>themselves that this was to be the route to college. The only way<br>to escape this empty life was to submit to it.<br>Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In<br>pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or<br>another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. They<br>weren't left to create their own societies. They were junior members<br>of adult societies.<br>Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because<br>the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying<br>to learn. Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in<br>their distant offices, and see no connection (indeed, there is<br>precious little) between schoolwork and the work they'll do as<br>adults.<br>And if teenagers respected adults more, adults also had more use<br>for teenagers. After a couple years' training, an apprentice could<br>be a real help. Even the newest apprentice could be made to carry<br>messages or sweep the workshop.<br>Now adults have no immediate use for teenagers. They would be in<br>the way in an office. So they drop them off at school on their way<br>to work, much as they might drop the dog off at a kennel if they <br>were going away for the weekend.<br>What happened? We're up against a hard one here. The cause of this<br>problem is the same as the cause of so many present ills: specialization.<br>As jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them.<br>Kids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 at<br>the latest; kids on farms, where most people lived, began far <br>earlier. Now kids who go to college don't start working full-time <br>till 21 or 22. With some degrees, like MDs and PhDs, you may not<br>finish your training till 30.<br>Teenagers now are useless, except as cheap labor in industries like<br>fast food, which evolved to exploit precisely this fact. In almost<br>any other kind of work, they'd be a net loss. But they're also too <br>young to be left unsupervised. Someone has to watch over them, and<br>the most efficient way to do this is to collect them together in<br>one place. Then a few adults can watch all of them.<br>If you stop there, what you're describing is literally a prison,<br>albeit a part-time one. The problem is, many schools practically<br>do stop there. The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids.<br>But there is no external pressure to do this well. And so most<br>schools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don't really<br>take it seriously-- not even the smart kids. Much of the time we<br>were all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions.<br>In my high school French class we were supposed to read Hugo's _Les_<br>_Miserables._ I don't think any of us knew French well enough to make<br>our way through this enormous book. Like the rest of the class, I <br>just skimmed the Cliff's Notes. When we were given a test on the<br>book, I noticed that the questions sounded odd. They were full of <br>long words that our teacher wouldn't have used. Where had these <br>questions come from? From the Cliff's Notes, it turned out. The <br>teacher was using them too. We were all just pretending.<br>There are certainly great public school teachers. The energy and <br>imagination of my fourth grade teacher, Mr. Mihalko, made that <br>year something his students still talk about, thirty years later.<br>But teachers like him were individuals swimming<br>upstream. They couldn't fix the system.<br>In almost any group of people you'll find hierarchy.<br>When groups of adults form in the real world, it's generally for <br>some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best<br>at it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. <br>But hierarchy there must be.<br>And so the kids make one out of nothing.<br>We have a phrase to describe what happens when rankings have to be<br>created without any meaningful criteria. We say that the situation<br>_degenerates into a popularity contest._ And that's exactly what<br>happens in most American schools.<br>Instead of depending on some real test, one's rank<br>depends mostly on one's ability to increase one's rank. It's<br>like the court of Louis XIV. There is no external opponent, so the<br>kids become one another's opponents.<br>When there is some real external test of skill, it isn't painful<br>to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. A rookie on a football team<br>doesn't resent the skill of the veteran; he hopes to be like him<br>one day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him.<br>The veteran may in turn feel a sense of<br>_noblesse oblige_.<br>And most importantly, their status depends on how well they<br>do against opponents, not on whether they can push the other down.<br>Court hierarchies are another thing entirely. This type of society<br>debases anyone who enters it. There is neither admiration at the <br>bottom, nor _noblesse oblige_ at the top. It's kill or be killed.<br>This is the sort of society that gets created<br>in American<br>secondary schools. And it happens because these schools have no<br>real purpose beyond keeping the kids all in one place for a certain<br>number of hours each day. What I didn't realize at the time, and<br>in fact didn't realize till very recently, is that the twin horrors<br>of school life, the cruelty and the boredom, both have the same <br>cause.<br>The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences<br>than just making kids unhappy for six years. It breeds a rebelliousness<br>that actively drives kids away from the things they're supposed to<br>be learning.<br>Like many nerds, probably, it was years after high school before I<br>could bring myself to read anything we'd been assigned then.<br>And I lost more than books. I mistrusted words like "character" and <br>"integrity" because they had been so debased by adults. As they<br>were used then, these words all seemed to mean the same thing:<br>obedience. The kids who got praised for these qualities tended to <br>be at best dull-witted prize bulls, and at worst facile schmoozers.<br>If that was what character and integrity were, I wanted no part of<br>them.<br>The word I most misunderstood was "tact." As used by adults, it<br>seemed to mean keeping your mouth shut.<br>I assumed it was derived from the same root as<br>"tacit" and "taciturn," and that it literally meant being quiet. I<br>vowed that I would never be tactful; they were never going to shut<br>me up. In fact, it's derived from the same root as "tactile," and<br>what it means is to have a deft touch. Tactful is the opposite of<br>clumsy. I don't think I learned this until college.<br>Nerds aren't the only losers in the popularity rat race. Nerds are<br>unpopular because they're distracted. There are other kids who<br>deliberately opt out because they're so disgusted with the whole <br>process.<br>Teenage kids, even rebels, don't like to be alone, so when kids opt<br>out of the system, they tend to do it as a group. At the schools I<br>went to, the focus of rebellion was drug use, specifically marijuana.<br>The kids in this tribe wore black concert t-shirts and were called<br>"freaks."<br>Freaks and nerds were allies, and there was a good deal of overlap<br>between them. Freaks were on the whole smarter than other kids,<br>though never studying (or at least never appearing to) was an <br>important tribal value. I was more in the nerd camp, but I was<br>friends with a lot of freaks.<br>They used drugs, at least at first, for the social bonds they<br>created. It was something to do together, and because the drugs <br>were illegal, it was a shared badge of rebellion.<br>I'm not claiming that bad schools are the whole reason kids get<br>into trouble with drugs. After a while, drugs have their own momentum.<br>No doubt some of the freaks ultimately used drugs to escape from <br>other problems-- trouble at home, for example. But, in my school<br>at least, the reason most kids _started_ using drugs was rebellion.<br>Fourteen-year-olds didn't start smoking pot because they'd heard<br>it would help them forget their problems. They started because they<br>wanted to join a different tribe.<br>Misrule breeds rebellion; this is not a new idea. And yet the<br>authorities still for the most part act as if drugs were themselves<br>the cause of the problem.<br>The real problem is the emptiness of school life. We won't see<br>solutions till adults realize that. The adults who<br>may realize it first are the ones who were themselves nerds in <br>school. Do you want your kids to be as unhappy in eighth grade as<br>you were? I wouldn't. Well, then, is there anything we can do to<br>fix things? Almost certainly. There is nothing inevitable about the<br>current system. It has come about mostly by default.<br>Adults, though, are busy. Showing up for school plays is one thing.<br>Taking on the educational bureaucracy is another. Perhaps a few<br>will have the energy to try to change things. I suspect the hardest <br>part is realizing that you can.<br>Nerds still in school should not hold their breath. Maybe one day<br>a heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to <br>rescue you, but they probably won't be coming this month. Any <br>immediate improvement in nerds' lives is probably going to have to<br>come from the nerds themselves.<br>Merely understanding the situation they're in should make it less <br>painful. Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game,<br>and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults<br>know this. It's hard to find successful adults now who don't claim<br>to have been nerds in high school.<br>It's important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life.<br>School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral.<br>It's all-encompassing, like life, but it isn't the real thing. It's<br>only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while<br>you're still in it.<br>If life seems awful to kids, it's neither because hormones are <br>turning you all into monsters (as your parents believe), nor because<br>life actually is awful (as you believe). It's because the adults,<br>who no longer have any economic use for you, have abandoned you to<br>spend years cooped up together with nothing real to do. _Any_ society<br>of that type is awful to live in.<br>You don't have<br>to look any further to explain why teenage kids are unhappy.<br>I've said some harsh things in this essay, but really the thesis<br>is an optimistic one-- that several problems we take for granted<br>are in fact not insoluble after all. Teenage kids are not inherently<br>unhappy monsters. That should be encouraging news to kids and adults<br>both.<br>**Thanks** to Sarah Harlin, Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris,<br>Eric Raymond, and Jackie Weicker for reading drafts of this essay,<br>and Maria Daniels for scanning photos. |
