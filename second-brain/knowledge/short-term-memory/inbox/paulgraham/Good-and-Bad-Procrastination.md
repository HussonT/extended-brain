| ![Good and Bad Procrastination](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/good-and-bad-procrastination-2.gif)<br>December 2005<br>The most impressive people I know are all terrible procrastinators.<br>So could it be that procrastination isn't always bad?<br>Most people who write about procrastination write about how to cure<br>it. But this is, strictly speaking, impossible. There are an<br>infinite number of things you could be doing. No matter what you<br>work on, you're not working on everything else. So the question<br>is not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well.<br>There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you<br>do instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing,<br>(b) something less important, or (c) something more important. That<br>last type, I'd argue, is good procrastination.<br>That's the "absent-minded professor," who forgets to shave, or eat,<br>or even perhaps look where he's going while he's thinking about<br>some interesting question. His mind is absent from the everyday<br>world because it's hard at work in another.<br>That's the sense in which the most impressive people I know are all<br>procrastinators. They're type-C procrastinators: they put off<br>working on small stuff to work on big stuff.<br>What's "small stuff?" Roughly, work that has zero chance of being<br>mentioned in your obituary. It's hard to say at the time what will<br>turn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus on<br>Sumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote<br>under a pseudonym?), but there's a whole class of tasks you can<br>safely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the house,<br>writing thank-you notes—anything that might be called an errand.<br>Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.<br>Good in a sense, at least. The people who want you to do the errands<br>won't think it's good. But you probably have to annoy them if you<br>want to get anything done. The mildest seeming people, if they<br>want to do real work, all have a certain degree of ruthlessness<br>when it comes to avoiding errands.<br>Some errands, like replying to letters, go away if you<br>ignore them (perhaps taking friends with them). Others, like mowing<br>the lawn, or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put them<br>off. In principle it shouldn't work to put off the second kind of<br>errand. You're going to have to do whatever it is eventually. Why<br>not (as past-due notices are always saying) do it now?<br>The reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real work<br>needs two things errands don't: big chunks of time, and the<br>right mood. If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net<br>win to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few<br>days to work on it. Yes, those errands may cost you more time when<br>you finally get around to them. But if you get a lot done during<br>those few days, you will be net more productive.<br>In fact, it may not be a difference in degree, but a difference in<br>kind. There may be types of work that can only be done in long,<br>uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully<br>in scheduled little slices. Empirically it seems to be so. When<br>I think of the people I know who've done great things, I don't<br>imagine them dutifully crossing items off to-do lists. I imagine<br>them sneaking off to work on some new idea.<br>Conversely, forcing someone to perform errands synchronously is<br>bound to limit their productivity. The cost of an interruption is<br>not just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on either<br>side in half. You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple<br>times a day before they're unable to work on hard problems at all.<br>I've wondered a lot about why <br>[startups](https://paulgraham.com/start.html) are most productive at the<br>very beginning, when they're just a couple guys in an apartment.<br>The main reason may be that there's no one to interrupt them yet.<br>In theory it's good when the founders finally get enough money to<br>hire people to do some of the work for them. But it may be better<br>to be overworked than interrupted. Once you dilute a startup with<br>ordinary office workers—with type-B procrastinators—the whole<br>company starts to resonate at their frequency. They're interrupt-driven,<br>and soon you are too.<br>Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of<br>people use them for that purpose. Someone who has decided to write<br>a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs<br>cleaning. People who fail to write novels don't do it by sitting<br>in front of a blank page for days without writing anything. They<br>do it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they need for<br>their apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email. "I<br>don't have time to work," they say. And they don't; they've made<br>sure of that.<br>(There's also a variant where one has no place to work. The cure<br>is to visit the places where famous people worked, and see how<br>unsuitable they were.)<br>I've used both these excuses at one time or another. I've learned<br>a lot of tricks for making myself work over the last 20 years, but<br>even now I don't win consistently. Some days I get real work done.<br>Other days are eaten up by errands. And I know it's usually my<br>fault: I _let_ errands eat up the day, to avoid<br>facing some hard problem.<br>The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B<br>procrastination, because it doesn't feel like procrastination.<br>You're "getting things done." Just the wrong things.<br>Any advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossing<br>things off your to-do list is not only incomplete, but positively<br>misleading, if it doesn't consider the possibility that the to-do<br>list is itself a form of type-B procrastination. In fact, possibility<br>is too weak a word. Nearly everyone's is. Unless you're working<br>on the biggest things you could be working on, you're type-B<br>procrastinating, no matter how much you're getting done.<br>In his famous essay [You and Your Research](https://paulgraham.com/hamming.html) <br>(which I recommend to<br>anyone ambitious, no matter what they're working on), Richard Hamming<br>suggests that you ask yourself three questions:<br>1. What are the most important problems in your field?<br>   <br>2. Are you working on one of them?<br>   <br>3. Why not?<br>   <br>Hamming was at Bell Labs when he started asking such questions. In<br>principle anyone there ought to have been able to work on the most<br>important problems in their field. Perhaps not everyone can make<br>an equally dramatic mark on the world; I don't know; but whatever<br>your capacities, there are projects that stretch them. So Hamming's<br>exercise can be generalized to:<br>> What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't<br>>  you?<br>Most people will shy away from this question. I shy away from it<br>myself; I see it there on the page and quickly move on to the next<br>sentence. Hamming used to go around actually asking people this,<br>and it didn't make him popular. But it's a question anyone ambitious<br>should face.<br>The trouble is, you may end up hooking a very big fish with this<br>bait. To do good work, you need to do more than find good projects.<br>Once you've found them, you have to get yourself to work on them,<br>and that can be hard. The bigger the problem, the harder it is to<br>get yourself to work on it.<br>Of course, the main reason people find it difficult to work on a<br>particular problem is that they don't <br>[enjoy](https://paulgraham.com/hs.html) it. When you're young,<br>especially, you often find yourself working on stuff you don't<br>really like-- because it seems impressive, for example, or because<br>you've been assigned to work on it. Most grad students are stuck<br>working on big problems they don't really like, and grad school is<br>thus synonymous with procrastination.<br>But even when you like what you're working on, it's easier to get<br>yourself to work on small problems than big ones. Why? Why is it<br>so hard to work on big problems? One reason is that you may not<br>get any reward in the forseeable future. If you work on something<br>you can finish in a day or two, you can expect to have a nice feeling<br>of accomplishment fairly soon. If the reward is indefinitely far<br>in the future, it seems less real.<br>Another reason people don't work on big projects is, ironically,<br>fear of wasting time. What if they fail? Then all the time they<br>spent on it will be wasted. (In fact it probably won't be, because<br>work on hard projects almost always leads somewhere.)<br>But the trouble with big problems can't be just that they promise<br>no immediate reward and might cause you to waste a lot of time. If<br>that were all, they'd be no worse than going to visit your in-laws.<br>There's more to it than that. Big problems are _terrifying_.<br>There's an almost physical pain in facing them. It's like having<br>a vacuum cleaner hooked up to your imagination. All your initial<br>ideas get sucked out immediately, and you don't have any more, and<br>yet the vacuum cleaner is still sucking.<br>You can't look a big problem too directly in the eye. You have to<br>approach it somewhat obliquely. But you have to adjust the angle<br>just right: you have to be facing the big problem directly enough<br>that you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not<br>so much that it paralyzes you. You can tighten the angle once you<br>get going, just as a sailboat can sail closer to the wind once it<br>gets underway.<br>If you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourself<br>into doing it. You have to work on small things that could grow<br>into big things, or work on successively larger things, or split<br>the moral load with collaborators. It's not a sign of weakness to<br>depend on such tricks. The very best work has been done this way.<br>When I talk to people who've managed to make themselves work on big<br>things, I find that all blow off errands, and all feel guilty about<br>it. I don't think they should feel guilty. There's more to do<br>than anyone could. So someone doing the best work they can is<br>inevitably going to leave a lot of errands undone. It seems a<br>mistake to feel bad about that.<br>I think the way to "solve" the problem of procrastination is to let<br>delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you. Work on<br>an ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to the<br>wind as you can, and you'll leave the right things undone.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert<br>Morris for reading drafts of this. |
