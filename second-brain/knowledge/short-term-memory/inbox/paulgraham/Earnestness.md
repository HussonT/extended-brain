| ![Earnestness](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/earnestness-4.gif)<br>December 2020<br>Jessica and I have certain words that have special significance<br>when we're talking about startups. The highest compliment we can<br>pay to founders is to describe them as "earnest." This is not by<br>itself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable.<br>But when founders are both formidable (another of our words) and<br>earnest, they're as close to unstoppable as you get.<br>Earnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seems<br>a bit of an anachronism that people in Silicon Valley would care<br>about it. Why does this matter so much?<br>When you call someone earnest, you're making a statement about their<br>motives. It means both that they're doing something for the right<br>reasons, and that they're trying as hard as they can. If we imagine<br>motives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitude<br>are right. Though these are of course related: when people are doing<br>something for the right reasons, they try harder.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f1n)\]<br>The reason motives matter so much in Silicon Valley is that so many<br>people there have the wrong ones. Starting a successful startup<br>makes you rich and famous. So a lot of the people trying to start<br>them are doing it for those reasons. Instead of what? Instead of<br>interest in the problem for its own sake. That is the root of<br>earnestness. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f2n)\]<br>It's also the hallmark of a nerd. Indeed, when people describe<br>themselves as "x nerds," what they mean is that they're interested<br>in x for its own sake, and not because it's cool to be interested<br>in x, or because of what they can get from it. They're saying they<br>care so much about x that they're willing to sacrifice seeming cool<br>for its sake.<br>A [genuine interest](https://paulgraham.com/genius.html) <br>in something is a very powerful motivator â€” for<br>some people, the most powerful motivator of all.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f3n)\]<br>Which is why<br>it's what Jessica and I look for in founders. But as well as being<br>a source of strength, it's also a source of vulnerability. Caring<br>constrains you. The earnest can't easily reply in kind to mocking<br>banter, or put on a cool facade of nihil admirari. They care too<br>much. They are doomed to be the straight man. That's a real<br>disadvantage in your <br>[teenage years](https://paulgraham.com/nerds.html), <br>when mocking banter and nihil<br>admirari often have the upper hand. But it becomes an advantage<br>later.<br>It's a commonplace now that the kids who were <br>nerds in high school<br>become the cool kids' bosses later on. But people misunderstand why<br>this happens. It's not just because the nerds are smarter, but also<br>because they're more earnest. When the problems get harder than the<br>fake ones you're given in high school, caring about them starts to<br>matter.<br>Does it always matter? Do the earnest always win? Not always. It<br>probably doesn't matter much in politics, or in crime, or in certain<br>types of business that are similar to crime, like gambling, personal<br>injury law, patent trolling, and so on. Nor does it matter in<br>academic fields at the more <br>[bogus](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=hermeneutic+dialectics+hegemonic+phenomenology+intersectionality) end of the spectrum. And though<br>I don't know enough to say for sure, it may not matter in some kinds<br>of humor: it may be possible to be completely cynical and still be<br>very funny.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f4n)\]<br>Looking at the list of fields I mentioned, there's an obvious<br>pattern. Except possibly for humor, these are all types of work I'd<br>avoid like the plague. So that could be a useful heuristic for<br>deciding which fields to work in: how much does earnestness matter?<br>Which can in turn presumably be inferred from the prevalence of<br>nerds at the top.<br>Along with "nerd," another word that tends to be associated with<br>earnestness is "naive." The earnest often seem naive. It's not<br>just that they don't have the motives other people have. They often<br>don't fully grasp that such motives exist. Or they may know<br>intellectually that they do, but because they don't feel them, they<br>forget about them.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f5n)\]<br>It works to be slightly naive not just about motives but also,<br>believe it or not, about the problems you're working on. Naive<br>optimism can compensate for the bit rot that <br>[rapid change](https://paulgraham.com/ecw.html) causes<br>in established beliefs. You plunge into some problem saying "How<br>hard can it be?", and then after solving it you learn that it was<br>till recently insoluble.<br>Naivete is an obstacle for anyone who wants to seem sophisticated,<br>and this is one reason would-be intellectuals find it so difficult<br>to understand Silicon Valley. It hasn't been safe for such people<br>to use the word "earnest" outside scare quotes since Oscar Wilde<br>wrote "The Importance of Being Earnest" in 1895. And yet when you<br>zoom in on Silicon Valley, right into <br>[Jessica Livingston's brain](https://paulgraham.com/jessica.html),<br>that's what her x-ray vision<br>is seeking out in founders. Earnestness!<br>Who'd have guessed? Reporters literally can't believe it when<br>founders making piles of money say that they started their companies<br>to make the world better. The situation seems made for mockery.<br>How can these founders be so naive as not to realize how implausible<br>they sound?<br>Though those asking this question don't realize it, that's not a<br>rhetorical question.<br>A lot of founders are faking it, of course, particularly the smaller<br>fry, and the soon to be smaller fry. But not all of them. There are<br>a significant number of founders who really are interested in the<br>problem they're solving mainly for its own sake.<br>Why shouldn't there be? We have no difficulty believing that people<br>would be interested in history or math or even old bus tickets for<br>their own sake. Why can't there be people interested in self-driving<br>cars or social networks for their own sake? When you look at the<br>question from this side, it seems obvious there would be. And isn't<br>it likely that having a deep interest in something would be a source<br>of great energy and resilience? It is in every other field.<br>The question really is why we have a blind spot about business.<br>And the answer to that is obvious if you know enough history. For<br>most of history, making large amounts of money has not been very<br>intellectually interesting. In preindustrial times it was never far<br>from robbery, and some areas of business still retain that character,<br>except using lawyers instead of soldiers.<br>But there are other areas of business where the work is genuinely<br>interesting. Henry Ford got to spend much of his time working on<br>interesting technical problems, and for the last several decades<br>the trend in that direction has been accelerating. It's much easier<br>now to make a lot of money by working on something you're interested<br>in than it was [50 years ago](https://paulgraham.com/re.html). <br>And that, rather than how fast they<br>grow, may be the most important change that startups represent.<br>Though indeed, the fact that the work is genuinely interesting is<br>a big part of why it gets done so fast.<br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f6n)\]<br>Can you imagine a more important change than one in the relationship<br>between intellectual curiosity and money? These are two of the most<br>powerful forces in the world, and in my lifetime they've become<br>significantly more aligned. How could you not be fascinated to watch<br>something like this happening in real time?<br>I meant this essay to be about earnestness generally, and now I've<br>gone and talked about startups again. But I suppose at least it<br>serves as an example of an x nerd in the wild.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>It's interesting how many different ways there are _not_ to<br>be earnest: to be cleverly cynical, to be superficially brilliant,<br>to be conspicuously virtuous, to be cool, to be sophisticated, to<br>be orthodox, to be a snob, to bully, to pander, to be on the make.<br>This pattern suggests that earnestness is not one end of a continuum,<br>but a target one can fall short of in multiple dimensions.<br>Another thing I notice about this list is that it sounds like a<br>list of the ways people behave on Twitter. Whatever else social<br>media is, it's a vivid catalogue of ways not to be earnest.<br>\[2\]<br>People's motives are as mixed in Silicon Valley as anywhere<br>else. Even the founders motivated mostly by money tend to be at<br>least somewhat interested in the problem they're solving, and even<br>the founders most interested in the problem they're solving also<br>like the idea of getting rich. But there's great variation in the<br>relative proportions of different founders' motivations.<br>And when I talk about "wrong" motives, I don't mean morally wrong.<br>There's nothing morally wrong with starting a startup to make money.<br>I just mean that those startups don't do as well.<br>\[3\]<br>The most powerful motivator for most people is probably family.<br>But there are some for whom intellectual curiosity comes first. In<br>his (wonderful) autobiography, Paul Halmos says explicitly that for<br>a mathematician, math must come before anything else, including<br>family. Which at least implies that it did for him.<br>\[4\]<br>Interestingly, just as the word "nerd" implies earnestness even<br>when used as a metaphor, the word "politics" implies the opposite.<br>It's not only in actual politics that earnestness seems to be a<br>handicap, but also in office politics and academic politics.<br>\[5\]<br>It's a bigger social error to seem naive in most European<br>countries than it is in America, and this may be one of subtler<br>reasons startups are less common there. Founder culture is completely<br>at odds with sophisticated cynicism.<br>The most earnest part of Europe is Scandinavia, and not surprisingly<br>this is also the region with the highest number of successful<br>startups per capita.<br>\[6\]<br>Much of business is schleps, and probably always will be. But<br>even being a professor is largely schleps. It would be interesting<br>to collect statistics about the schlep ratios of different jobs,<br>but I suspect they'd rarely be less than 30%.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Suhail Doshi, Jessica<br>Livingston, Mattias Ljungman, Harj Taggar, and Kyle Vogt for reading<br>drafts of this. |
