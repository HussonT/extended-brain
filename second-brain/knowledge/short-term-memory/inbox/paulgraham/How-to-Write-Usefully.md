| ![How to Write Usefully](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-write-usefully-4.gif)<br>February 2020<br>What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's<br>what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can<br>aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.<br>To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough<br>merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by<br>making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for<br>example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go<br>wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are<br>many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too<br>simplistic a view of it, and so on.<br>Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.<br>Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made<br>without becoming false.<br>For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the<br>middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say<br>it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because<br>it's a bit east of the middle.<br>Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to<br>satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous<br>academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues.<br>Useful writing is bold, but true.<br>It's also two other things: it tells people something important,<br>and that at least some of them didn't already know.<br>Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean<br>surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they<br>knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may<br>be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more<br>fundamental.<br>Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something<br>true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them<br>as unequivocally as possible.<br>Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't<br>expect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have<br>will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's<br>7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot<br>of readers.<br>Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four<br>components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score<br>for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but<br>nonetheless true.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and<br>important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I<br>learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying<br>anything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure<br>it's worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him,<br>but when you do, they're usually right.<br>Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write<br>a bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again.<br>Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes<br>a whole essay.<br>You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can<br>ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the<br>ones that aren't.<br>In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered<br>bad. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results,<br>you're supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay<br>writing, publication bias is the way to go.<br>My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an<br>essay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting<br>it very carefully.<br>I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but<br>I'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing<br>them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that<br>stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily<br>written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The<br>annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or<br>so I'm saying "Ugh, that part" each time I hit it. They become like<br>briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won't<br>publish an essay till they're all gone â€” till I can read through<br>the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.<br>I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't<br>think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through<br>one that doesn't seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence<br>doesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and<br>you've usually got the replacement right there in your head.<br>This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You<br>don't have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you<br>need to get it right. You don't have to publish the essay at all,<br>if you can't get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the<br>face of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that's what it feels<br>like. What's really going on is that you have different expectations<br>for yourself. You're like a parent saying to a child "we can sit<br>here all night till you eat your vegetables." Except you're the<br>child too.<br>I'm not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition<br>(c) in ["A Way to Detect Bias"](https://paulgraham.com/bias.html) <br>after readers pointed out that I'd<br>omitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.<br>There's a trick for getting importance too. It's like the trick I<br>suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something<br>you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader.<br>The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about<br>topics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important<br>to a significant number of readers as well.<br>Importance has two factors. It's the number of people something<br>matters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course<br>that it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann<br>sum.<br>The way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about<br>a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this<br>department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've<br>thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a<br>significant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and<br>importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you<br>will. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't<br>publish it.<br>You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the<br>novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of<br>it. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in<br>this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble.<br>If you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit<br>when you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident<br>that most other people wouldn't know it either.<br>The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two<br>things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. These<br>two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in<br>a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression<br>of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something<br>you're sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all,<br>as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that<br>seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses.<br>As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less<br>qualification. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimes<br>you don't even want to, if it's a side point and a fully refined<br>version would be too long.<br>Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you<br>should never begin a sentence in an essay with "I think," because<br>if you're saying it, then of course you think it. And it's true<br>that "I think x" is a weaker statement than simply "x." Which is<br>exactly why you need "I think." You need it to express your degree<br>of certainty.<br>But qualifications are not scalars. They're not just experimental<br>error. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something<br>applies, how you know it, how happy you are it's so, even how it<br>could be falsified. I'm not going to try to explore the structure<br>of qualification here. It's probably more complex than the whole<br>topic of writing usefully. Instead I'll just give you a practical<br>tip: Don't underestimate qualification. It's an important skill in<br>its own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to<br>avoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full range.<br>It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it's part of<br>having them.<br>There's one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as<br>simply as possible. But I don't think this is a component of<br>usefulness. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader. And<br>it's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more<br>obvious when expressed in simple language. But I'll admit that the<br>main reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or because<br>it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more<br>or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program<br>that's too long.<br>I realize florid writing works for some people. But unless you're<br>sure you're one of them, the best advice is to write as simply as<br>you can.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>I believe the formula I've given you, importance + novelty +<br>correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay. But I should<br>warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.<br>The root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people something<br>they didn't know, they don't always thank you for it. Sometimes the<br>reason people don't know something is because they don't want to<br>know it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. And<br>indeed, if you're looking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken<br>beliefs are a good place to find them. Every popular mistaken belief<br>creates a [dead zone](https://paulgraham.com/nov.html) of ideas around <br>it that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.<br>The strength component just makes things worse. If there's anything<br>that annoys people more than having their cherished assumptions<br>contradicted, it's having them flatly contradicted.<br>Plus if you've used the Morris technique, your writing will seem<br>quite confident. Perhaps offensively confident, to people who<br>disagree with you. The reason you'll seem confident is that you are<br>confident: you've cheated, by only publishing the things you're<br>sure of. It will seem to people who try to disagree with you that<br>you never admit you're wrong. In fact you constantly admit you're<br>wrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after.<br>And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things<br>worse. Brevity is the diction of command. If you watch someone<br>delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you'll<br>notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereas<br>to be short with someone is more or less to be rude to them.<br>It can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weakly<br>than you mean. To put "perhaps" in front of something you're actually<br>quite sure of. But you'll notice that when writers do this, they<br>usually do it with a wink.<br>I don't like to do this too much. It's cheesy to adopt an ironic<br>tone for a whole essay. I think we just have to face the fact that<br>elegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.<br>You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that<br>an essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That's sort<br>of true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice<br>that's little consolation.<br>In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you<br>particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you've stated an<br>idea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyone<br>has to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is<br>false.<br>Much of the time they're not even doing it deliberately. One of the<br>most surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays,<br>is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what<br>you've actually written. Instead they make up something you said<br>and disagree with that.<br>For what it's worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does<br>this to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that they<br>believe is false, and explain why. I say "for what it's worth"<br>because they never do. So although it might seem that this could<br>get a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it was<br>never on track in the first place.<br>Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if<br>they're misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned<br>person might make. In fact it's sometimes better to say something<br>slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get<br>an idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient, and can also<br>model the way such an idea would be discovered.<br>But I don't think you should explicitly forestall intentional<br>misinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place to<br>meet honest readers. You don't want to spoil your house by putting<br>bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The place<br>to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes.<br>But don't think you can predict them all. People are as ingenious<br>at misrepresenting you when you say something they don't want to<br>hear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they<br>want to do but know they shouldn't. I suspect it's the same skill.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays<br>is to practice. But how do you start? Now that we've examined the<br>structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more<br>precisely. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is,<br>the first component of importance: the number of people who care<br>about what you write.<br>If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something<br>you're an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you only<br>have ten readers who care, that's fine. You're helping them, and<br>you're writing. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you write<br>about.<br>The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication.<br>Writing essays doesn't have to mean publishing them. That may seem<br>strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but<br>it worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for<br>about 15 years. I never published any of them and never expected<br>to. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the web<br>came along I'd had a lot of practice.<br>Incidentally, <br>[Steve \<br>Wozniak](http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html) did the same thing. In high school he<br>designed computers on paper for fun. He couldn't build them because<br>he couldn't afford the components. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMs<br>in 1975, he was ready.<br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_<br>How many essays are there left to write though? The answer to that<br>question is probably the most exciting thing I've learned about<br>essay writing. Nearly all of them are left to write.<br>Although [the essay](https://paulgraham.com/essay.html) <br>is an old form, it hasn't been assiduously<br>cultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there<br>wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many. You could<br>publish essays if you were already well known for writing something<br>else, like novels. Or you could write book reviews that you took<br>over to express your own ideas. But there was not really a direct<br>path to becoming an essayist. Which meant few essays got written,<br>and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.<br>Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path. Anyone can publish<br>essays online. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least you<br>can start. You don't need anyone's permission.<br>It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for<br>years, till some change makes it explode. Cryptography did this to<br>number theory. The internet is doing it to the essay.<br>The exciting thing is not that there's a lot left to write, but<br>that there's a lot left to discover. There's a certain kind of idea<br>that's best discovered by writing essays. If most essays are still<br>unwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\] Put railings on the balconies, but don't put bars on the windows.<br>\[2\] Even now I sometimes write essays that are not meant for<br>publication. I wrote several to figure out what Y Combinator should<br>do, and they were really helpful.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, and<br>Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. |
