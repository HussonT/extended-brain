| ![The Hacker's Guide to Investors](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-hacker-s-guide-to-investors-2.gif)<br>April 2007<br>_(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at the 2007 ASES Summit_<br>_at Stanford.)_<br>The world of investors is a foreign one to most hackers—partly<br>because investors are so unlike hackers, and partly because they<br>tend to operate in secret. I've been dealing with this world for<br>many years, both as a founder and an investor, and I still don't<br>fully understand it.<br>In this essay I'm going to list some of the more surprising things<br>I've learned about investors. Some I only learned in the past year.<br>Teaching hackers how to deal with investors is probably the second<br>most important thing we do at Y Combinator. The most important<br>thing for a startup is to make something good. But everyone knows<br>that's important. The dangerous thing about investors is that<br>hackers don't know how little they know about this strange world.<br>**1\. The investors are what make a startup hub.**<br>About a year ago I tried to figure out what you'd need to reproduce<br>[Silicon Valley](https://paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html). I decided the <br>critical ingredients were rich people<br>and nerds—investors and founders. People are all you need to<br>make technology, and all the other people will move.<br>If I had to narrow that down, I'd say investors are the limiting<br>factor. Not because they contribute more to the startup, but simply<br>because they're least willing to move. They're rich. They're not<br>going to move to Albuquerque just because there are some smart<br>hackers there they could invest in. Whereas hackers will move to<br>the Bay Area to find investors.<br>**2\. Angel investors are the most critical.**<br>There are several types of investors. The two main categories are<br>angels and VCs: VCs invest other people's money, and angels invest<br>their own.<br>Though they're less well known, the angel investors are probably<br>the more critical ingredient in creating a silicon valley. Most<br>companies that VCs invest in would never have made it that far if angels<br>hadn't invested first. VCs say between half and three quarters of<br>companies that raise series A rounds have taken some outside<br>investment already.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/guidetoinvestors.html#f1n)\]<br>Angels are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs. They also<br>give valuable advice, because (unlike VCs) many have been startup<br>founders themselves.<br>Google's story shows the key role angels play. A lot of people know<br>Google raised money from Kleiner and Sequoia. What most don't realize<br>is how late. That VC round was a series B round; the premoney<br>valuation was $75 million. Google was already a successful company<br>at that point. Really, Google was funded with angel money.<br>It may seem odd that the canonical Silicon Valley startup was funded<br>by angels, but this is not so surprising. Risk is always proportionate<br>to reward. So the most successful startup of all is likely to have<br>seemed an extremely risky bet at first, and that is exactly the<br>kind VCs won't touch.<br>Where do angel investors come from? From other startups. So startup<br>hubs like Silicon Valley benefit from something like the marketplace<br>effect, but shifted in time: startups are there because startups<br>were there.<br>**3\. Angels don't like publicity.**<br>If angels are so important, why do we hear more about VCs? Because<br>VCs like publicity. They need to market themselves to the investors<br>who are their "customers"—the endowments and pension funds and<br>rich families whose money they invest—and also to founders who<br>might come to them for funding.<br>Angels don't need to market themselves to investors because they<br>invest their own money. Nor do they want to market themselves to<br>founders: they don't want random people pestering them with business<br>plans. Actually, neither do VCs. Both angels and VCs get deals<br>almost exclusively through personal introductions. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/guidetoinvestors.html#f2n)\]<br>The reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more business<br>plans over the transom, but so they win deals when competing<br>against other VCs. Whereas angels are rarely in direct competition,<br>because (a) they do fewer deals, (b) they're happy to split them,<br>and (c) they invest at a point where the stream is broader.<br>**4\. Most investors, especially VCs, are not like founders.**<br>Some angels are, or were, hackers. But most VCs are a different<br>type of people: they're dealmakers.<br>If you're a hacker, here's a thought experiment you can run to<br>understand why there are basically no hacker VCs: How would you<br>like a job where you never got to make anything, but instead spent<br>all your time listening to other people pitch (mostly terrible)<br>projects, deciding whether to fund them, and sitting on their boards<br>if you did? That would not be fun for most hackers. Hackers like<br>to make things. This would be like being an administrator.<br>Because most VCs are a different species of people from<br>founders, it's hard to know what they're thinking. If you're a<br>hacker, the last time you had to deal with these guys was in high<br>school. Maybe in college you walked past their fraternity on your<br>way to the lab. But don't underestimate them. They're as expert<br>in their world as you are in yours. What they're good at is reading<br>people, and making deals work to their advantage. Think twice<br>before you try to beat them at that.<br>**5\. Most investors are momentum investors.**<br>Because most investors are dealmakers rather than technology people,<br>they generally don't understand what you're doing. I knew as a<br>founder that most VCs didn't get technology. I also knew some made<br>a lot of money. And yet it never occurred to me till recently to<br>put those two ideas together and ask "How can VCs make money by<br>investing in stuff they don't understand?"<br>The answer is that they're like momentum investors. You can (or<br>could once) make a lot of money by noticing sudden changes in stock<br>prices. When a stock jumps upward, you buy, and when it suddenly<br>drops, you sell. In effect you're insider trading, without knowing<br>what you know. You just know someone knows something, and that's<br>making the stock move.<br>This is how most venture investors operate. They don't try to look<br>at something and predict whether it will take off. They win by<br>noticing that something _is_ taking off a little sooner than everyone<br>else. That generates almost as good returns as actually being able<br>to pick winners. They may have to pay a little more than they would<br>if they got in at the very beginning, but only a little.<br>Investors always say what they really care about is the team.<br>Actually what they care most about is your traffic, then what other<br>investors think, then the team. If you don't yet have any traffic,<br>they fall back on number 2, what other investors think. And this,<br>as you can imagine, produces wild oscillations in the "stock price"<br>of a startup. One week everyone wants you, and they're begging not<br>to be cut out of the deal. But all it takes is for one big investor<br>to cool on you, and the next week no one will return your phone<br>calls. We regularly have startups go from hot to cold or cold to<br>hot in a matter of days, and literally nothing has changed.<br>There are two ways to deal with this phenomenon. If you're feeling<br>really confident, you can try to ride it. You can start by asking<br>a comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money, and then after<br>generating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for larger<br>amounts, stirring up a crescendo of buzz, and then "sell" at the<br>top. This is extremely risky, and takes months even if you succeed.<br>I wouldn't try it myself. My advice is to err on the side of safety:<br>when someone offers you a decent deal, just take it and get on with<br>building the company. Startups win or lose based on the quality<br>of their product, not the quality of their funding deals.<br>**6\. Most investors are looking for big hits.**<br>Venture investors like companies that could go public. That's where<br>the big returns are. They know the odds of any individual startup<br>going public are small, but they want to invest in those that at<br>least have a _chance_ of going public.<br>Currently the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of<br>companies, most of which fail, and one of which is Google. Those<br>few big wins compensate for losses on their other investments. What this<br>means is that most VCs will only invest in you if you're a potential<br>Google. They don't care about companies that are a safe bet to be<br>acquired for $20 million. There needs to be a chance, however<br>small, of the company becoming really big.<br>Angels are different in this respect. They're happy to invest in<br>a company where the most likely outcome is a $20 million acquisition<br>if they can do it at a low enough valuation. But of course they<br>like companies that could go public too. So having an ambitious<br>long-term plan pleases everyone.<br>If you take VC money, you have to mean it, because the structure<br>of VC deals prevents early acquisitions. If you take VC money,<br>they won't let you sell early.<br>**7\. VCs want to invest large amounts.**<br>The fact that they're running investment funds makes VCs want to<br>invest large amounts. A typical VC fund is now hundreds of millions<br>of dollars. If $400 million has to be invested by 10 partners,<br>they have to invest $40 million each. VCs usually sit on the boards<br>of companies they fund. If the average deal size was $1 million,<br>each partner would have to sit on 40 boards, which would not be<br>fun. So they prefer bigger deals, where they can put a lot of money<br>to work at once.<br>VCs don't regard you as a bargain if you don't need a lot of money.<br>That may even make you less attractive, because it means their<br>investment creates less of a barrier to entry for competitors.<br>Angels are in a different position because they're investing their<br>own money. They're happy to invest small amounts—sometimes as<br>little as $20,000—as long as the potential returns look good<br>enough. So if you're doing something inexpensive, go to angels.<br>**8\. Valuations are fiction.**<br>VCs admit that valuations are an artifact. They decide how much<br>money you need and how much of the company they want, and those two<br>constraints yield a valuation.<br>Valuations increase as the size of the investment does. A company<br>that an angel is willing to put $50,000 into at a valuation of a<br>million can't take $6 million from VCs at that valuation. That<br>would leave the founders less than a seventh of the company between<br>them (since the option pool would also come out of that seventh).<br>Most VCs wouldn't want that, which is why you never hear of deals<br>where a VC invests $6 million at a premoney valuation of $1 million.<br>If valuations change depending on the amount invested, that shows<br>how far they are from reflecting any kind of value of the company.<br>Since valuations are made up, founders shouldn't care too much about<br>them. That's not the part to focus on. In fact, a high valuation<br>can be a bad thing. If you take funding at a premoney valuation<br>of $10 million, you won't be selling the company for 20. You'll<br>have to sell for over 50 for the VCs to get even a 5x return, which<br>is low to them. More likely they'll want you to hold out for 100.<br>But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting<br>bought at all; many companies can buy you for $10 million, but only<br>a handful for 100. And since a startup is like a pass/fail course<br>for the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a<br>good outcome, not the percentage of the company you keep.<br>So why do founders chase high valuations? They're tricked by<br>misplaced ambition. They feel they've achieved more if they get a<br>higher valuation. They usually know other founders, and if they<br>get a higher valuation they can say "mine is bigger than yours."<br>But funding is not the real test. The real test is the final outcome<br>for the founder, and getting too high a valuation may just make a<br>good outcome less likely.<br>The one advantage of a high valuation is that you get less dilution.<br>But there is another less sexy way to achieve that: just take less<br>money.<br>**9\. Investors look for founders like the current stars.**<br>Ten years ago investors were looking for the next Bill Gates. This<br>was a mistake, because Microsoft was a very anomalous startup. They<br>started almost as a contract programming operation, and the reason<br>they became huge was that IBM happened to drop the PC standard in<br>their lap.<br>Now all the VCs are looking for the next Larry and Sergey. This<br>is a good trend, because Larry and Sergey are closer to the ideal<br>startup founders.<br>Historically investors thought it was important for a founder to<br>be an expert in business. So they were willing to fund teams of<br>MBAs who planned to use the money to pay programmers to build their<br>product for them. This is like funding Steve Ballmer in the hope<br>that the programmer he'll hire is Bill Gates—kind of backward,<br>as the events of the Bubble showed. Now most VCs know they should<br>be funding technical guys. This is more pronounced among the very<br>top funds; the lamer ones still want to fund MBAs.<br>If you're a hacker, it's good news that investors are looking for<br>Larry and Sergey. The bad news is, the only investors who can do<br>it right are the ones who knew them when they were a<br>couple of CS grad students, not the confident media stars they are<br>today. What investors still don't get is how clueless and tentative<br>great founders can seem at the very beginning.<br>**10\. The contribution of investors tends to be underestimated.**<br>Investors do more for startups than give them money. They're helpful<br>in doing deals and arranging introductions, and some of the smarter<br>ones, particularly angels, can give good advice about the product.<br>In fact, I'd say what separates the great investors from the mediocre<br>ones is the quality of their advice. Most investors give advice,<br>but the top ones give _good_ advice.<br>Whatever help investors give a startup tends to be underestimated.<br>It's to everyone's advantage to let the world think the founders<br>thought of everything. The goal of the investors is for the company<br>to become valuable, and the company seems more valuable if it seems<br>like all the good ideas came from within.<br>This trend is compounded by the obsession that the press has with<br>founders. In a company founded by two people, 10% of the ideas<br>might come from the first guy they hire. Arguably they've done a<br>bad job of hiring otherwise. And yet this guy will be almost<br>entirely overlooked by the press.<br>I say this as a founder: the contribution of founders is always<br>overestimated. The danger here is that new founders, looking at<br>existing founders, will think that they're supermen that one couldn't<br>possibly equal oneself. Actually they have a hundred different<br>types of support people just offscreen making the whole show possible.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/guidetoinvestors.html#f3n)\]<br>**11\. VCs are afraid of looking bad.**<br>I've been very surprised to discover how timid most VCs are. They<br>seem to be afraid of looking bad to their partners, and perhaps<br>also to the limited partners—the people whose money they invest.<br>You can measure this fear in how much less risk VCs are willing to<br>take. You can tell they won't make investments for their fund that<br>they might be willing to make themselves as angels. Though it's<br>not quite accurate to say that VCs are less willing to take risks.<br>They're less willing to do things that might look bad. That's not<br>the same thing.<br>For example, most VCs would be very reluctant to invest in a startup<br>founded by a pair of 18 year old hackers, no matter how brilliant,<br>because if the startup failed their partners could turn on them and<br>say "What, you invested $x million of our money in a pair of 18<br>year olds?" Whereas if a VC invested in a startup founded by<br>three former banking executives in their 40s who planned to outsource<br>their product development—which to my mind is actually a lot<br>riskier than investing in a pair of really smart 18 year olds—he<br>couldn't be faulted, if it failed, for making such an apparently<br>prudent investment.<br>As a friend of mine said, "Most VCs can't do anything that would<br>sound bad to the kind of doofuses who run pension funds." Angels<br>can take greater risks because they don't have to answer to anyone.<br>**12\. Being turned down by investors doesn't mean much.**<br>Some founders are quite dejected when they get turned down by<br>investors. They shouldn't take it so much to heart. To start with,<br>investors are often wrong. It's hard to think of a successful<br>startup that wasn't turned down by investors at some point. Lots<br>of VCs rejected Google. So obviously the reaction of investors is<br>not a very meaningful test.<br>Investors will often reject you for what seem to be superficial<br>reasons. I read of one VC who <br>[turned\<br>down](http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2007/02/a_fatal_paper_c.html) a startup simply because<br>they'd given away so many little bits of stock that the deal required<br>too many signatures to close. <br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/guidetoinvestors.html#f4n)\]<br>The reason investors can get away<br>with this is that they see so many deals. It doesn't matter if<br>they underestimate you because of some surface imperfection, because<br>the next best deal will be [almost as good](https://paulgraham.com/judgement.html). <br>Imagine picking out<br>apples at a grocery store. You grab one with a little bruise.<br>Maybe it's just a surface bruise, but why even bother checking when<br>there are so many other unbruised apples to choose from?<br>Investors would be the first to admit they're often wrong. So when<br>you get rejected by investors, don't think "we suck," but instead<br>ask "do we suck?" Rejection is a question, not an answer.<br>**13\. Investors are emotional.**<br>I've been surprised to discover how emotional investors can be.<br>You'd expect them to be cold and calculating, or at least businesslike,<br>but often they're not. I'm not sure if it's their position of power<br>that makes them this way, or the large sums of money involved, but<br>investment negotiations can easily turn personal. If you offend<br>investors, they'll leave in a huff.<br>A while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round to a startup<br>we'd seed funded. Then they heard a rival VC firm was also interested.<br>They were so afraid that they'd be rejected in favor of this other<br>firm that they gave the startup what's known as an "exploding<br>termsheet." They had, I think, 24 hours to say yes or no, or the<br>deal was off. Exploding termsheets are a somewhat dubious device,<br>but not uncommon. What surprised me was their reaction when I<br>called to talk about it. I asked if they'd still be interested in<br>the startup if the rival VC didn't end up making an offer, and they<br>said no. What rational basis could they have had for saying that?<br>If they thought the startup was worth investing in, what difference<br>should it make what some other VC thought? Surely it was their<br>duty to their limited partners simply to invest in the best<br>opportunities they found; they should be delighted if the other VC<br>said no, because it would mean they'd overlooked a good opportunity.<br>But of course there was no rational basis for their decision. They<br>just couldn't stand the idea of taking this rival firm's rejects.<br>In this case the exploding termsheet was not (or not only) a tactic<br>to pressure the startup. It was more like the high school trick<br>of breaking up with someone before they can break up with you. In<br>an [earlier essay](https://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html) I said that VCs were a lot like high school girls.<br>A few VCs have joked about that characterization, but none have<br>disputed it.<br>**14\. The negotiation never stops till the closing.**<br>Most deals, for investment or acquisition, happen in two phases.<br>There's an initial phase of negotiation about the big questions.<br>If this succeeds you get a termsheet, so called because it outlines<br>the key terms of a deal. A termsheet is not legally binding,<br>but it is a definite step. It's supposed to mean that a<br>deal is going to happen, once the lawyers work out all the details.<br>In theory these details are minor ones; by definition all the<br>important points are supposed to be covered in the termsheet.<br>Inexperience and wishful thinking combine to make founders feel<br>that when they have a termsheet, they have a deal. They want there<br>to be a deal; everyone acts like they have a deal; so there must<br>be a deal. But there isn't and may not be for several months. A<br>lot can change for a startup in several months. It's not uncommon<br>for investors and acquirers to get buyer's remorse. So you have<br>to keep pushing, keep selling, all the way to the close. Otherwise<br>all the "minor" details left unspecified in the termsheet will be<br>interpreted to your disadvantage. The other side may even break<br>the deal; if they do that, they'll usually seize on some technicality<br>or claim you misled them, rather than admitting they changed their<br>minds.<br>It can be hard to keep the pressure on an investor or acquirer all<br>the way to the closing, because the most effective pressure is<br>competition from other investors or acquirers, and these tend to<br>drop away when you get a termsheet. You should try to stay as close<br>friends as you can with these rivals, but the most important thing<br>is just to keep up the momentum in your startup. The investors or<br>acquirers chose you because you seemed hot. Keep doing whatever<br>made you seem hot. Keep releasing new features; keep getting new<br>users; keep getting mentioned in the press and in blogs.<br>**15\. Investors like to co-invest.**<br>I've been surprised how willing investors are to split deals. You<br>might think that if they found a good deal they'd want it all to<br>themselves, but they seem positively eager to syndicate. This is<br>understandable with angels; they invest on a smaller scale and don't<br>like to have too much money tied up in any one deal. But VCs also<br>share deals a lot. Why?<br>Partly I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier:<br>after traffic, VCs care most what other VCs think. A deal that has<br>multiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of deals<br>that close, more will have multiple investors.<br>There is one rational reason to want multiple VCs in a deal: Any<br>investor who co-invests with you is one less investor who could<br>fund a competitor. Apparently Kleiner and Sequoia didn't like<br>splitting the Google deal, but it did at least have the advantage,<br>from each one's point of view, that there probably wouldn't be a<br>competitor funded by the other. Splitting deals thus has similar<br>advantages to confusing paternity.<br>But I think the main reason VCs like splitting deals is the fear<br>of looking bad. If another firm shares the deal, then in the event<br>of failure it will seem to have been a prudent choice—a consensus<br>decision, rather than just the whim of an individual partner.<br>**16\. Investors collude.**<br>Investing is not covered by antitrust law. At least, it better not<br>be, because investors regularly do things that would be illegal<br>otherwise. I know personally of cases where one investor has talked<br>another out of making a competitive offer, using the promise of<br>sharing future deals.<br>In principle investors are all competing for the same deals, but<br>the spirit of cooperation is stronger than the spirit of competition.<br>The reason, again, is that there are so many deals. Though a<br>professional investor may have a closer relationship with a founder<br>he invests in than with other investors, his relationship with the<br>founder is only going to last a couple years, whereas his relationship<br>with other firms will last his whole career. There isn't so much<br>at stake in his interactions with other investors, but there will<br>be a lot of them. Professional investors are constantly trading<br>little favors.<br>Another reason investors stick together is to preserve the power<br>of investors as a whole. So you will not, as of this writing, be<br>able to get investors into an auction for your series A round.<br>They'd rather lose the deal than establish a precedent of VCs<br>competitively bidding against one another. An efficient startup<br>funding market may be coming in the distant future; things tend to<br>move in that direction; but it's certainly not here now.<br>**17\. Large-scale investors care about their portfolio, not any**<br>**individual company.**<br>The reason startups work so well is that everyone with power also<br>has equity. The only way any of them can succeed is if they all<br>do. This makes everyone naturally pull in the same direction,<br>subject to differences of opinion about tactics.<br>The problem is, larger scale investors don't have exactly the same<br>motivation. Close, but not identical. They don't need any given<br>startup to succeed, like founders do, just their portfolio as a<br>whole to. So in borderline cases the rational thing for them to<br>do is to sacrifice unpromising startups.<br>Large-scale investors tend to put startups in three categories:<br>successes, failures, and the "living dead"—companies that are<br>plugging along but don't seem likely in the immediate future to get<br>bought or go public. To the founders, "living dead" sounds harsh.<br>These companies may be far from failures by ordinary standards. But<br>they might as well be from a venture investor's point of view, and<br>they suck up just as much time and attention as the successes. So<br>if such a company has two possible strategies, a conservative one<br>that's slightly more likely to work in the end, or a risky one that<br>within a short time will either yield a giant success or kill the<br>company, VCs will push for the kill-or-cure option. To them the<br>company is already a write-off. Better to have resolution, one way<br>or the other, as soon as possible.<br>If a startup gets into real trouble, instead of trying to save it<br>VCs may just sell it at a low price to another of their portfolio<br>companies. Philip Greenspun said in [_Founders at Work_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141) that Ars Digita's VCs did this to them.<br>**18\. Investors have different risk profiles from founders.**<br>Most people would rather a 100% chance of $1 million than a 20%<br>chance of $10 million. Investors are rich enough to be rational<br>and prefer the latter. So they'll always tend to encourage founders<br>to keep rolling the dice. If a company is doing well, investors<br>will want founders to turn down most acquisition offers. And indeed,<br>most startups that turn down acquisition offers ultimately do better.<br>But it's still hair-raising for the founders, because they might<br>end up with nothing. When someone's offering to buy you for a price<br>at which your stock is worth $5 million, saying no is equivalent<br>to having $5 million and betting it all on one spin of the roulette<br>wheel.<br>Investors will tell you the company is worth more. And they may<br>be right. But that doesn't mean it's wrong to sell. Any financial<br>advisor who put all his client's assets in the stock of a single,<br>private company would probably lose his license for it.<br>More and more, investors are letting founders cash out partially.<br>That should correct the problem. Most founders have such low standards<br>that they'll feel rich with a sum that doesn't seem huge to investors.<br>But this custom is spreading too slowly, because VCs are afraid of<br>seeming irresponsible. No one wants to be the first VC to give<br>someone fuck-you money and then actually get told "fuck you." But<br>until this does start to happen, we know VCs are being too conservative.<br>**19\. Investors vary greatly.**<br>Back when I was a founder I used to think all VCs were the same.<br>And in fact they do all [look](http://www.redpoint.com/team/) <br>the same. They're all what hackers<br>call "suits." But since I've been dealing with VCs more I've learned<br>that some suits are smarter than others.<br>They're also in a business where winners tend to keep winning and<br>losers to keep losing. When a VC firm has been successful in the<br>past, everyone wants funding from them, so they get the pick of all<br>the new deals. The self-reinforcing nature of the venture funding<br>market means that the top ten firms live in a completely different<br>world from, say, the hundredth. As well as being smarter, they<br>tend to be calmer and more upstanding; they don't need to do iffy<br>things to get an edge, and don't want to because they have more<br>brand to protect.<br>There are only two kinds of VCs you want to take money from, if you<br>have the luxury of choosing: the "top tier" VCs, meaning about the<br>top 20 or so firms, plus a few new ones that are not among the top<br>20 only because they haven't been around long enough.<br>It's particularly important to raise money from a top firm if you're<br>a hacker, because they're more confident. That means they're less<br>likely to stick you with a business guy as CEO, like VCs used to<br>do in the 90s. If you seem smart and want to do it, they'll let<br>you run the company.<br>**20\. Investors don't realize how much it costs to raise money from**<br>**them.**<br>Raising money is a huge time suck at just the point where startups<br>can least afford it. It's not unusual for it to take five or six<br>months to close a funding round. Six weeks is fast. And raising<br>money is not just something you can leave running as a background<br>process. When you're raising money, it's inevitably the main focus<br>of the company. Which means building the product isn't.<br>Suppose a Y Combinator company starts talking to VCs after demo<br>day, and is successful in raising money from them, closing the deal<br>after a comparatively short 8 weeks. Since demo day occurs after<br>10 weeks, the company is now 18 weeks old. Raising money, rather<br>than working on the product, has been the company's main focus for<br>44% of its existence. And mind you, this an example where things<br>turned out _well_.<br>When a startup does return to working on the product after a funding<br>round finally closes, it's as if they were returning to work after<br>a months-long illness. They've lost most of their momentum.<br>Investors have no idea how much they damage the companies they<br>invest in by taking so long to do it. But companies do. So there<br>is a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that invests<br>smaller amounts at lower valuations, but promises to either close<br>or say no very quickly. If there were such a firm, I'd recommend<br>it to startups in preference to any other, no matter how prestigious.<br>Startups live on speed and momentum.<br>**21\. Investors don't like to say no.**<br>The reason funding deals take so long to close is mainly that<br>investors can't make up their minds. VCs are not big companies;<br>they can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to. But they usually<br>let the initial meetings stretch out over a couple weeks. The<br>reason is the selection algorithm I mentioned earlier. Most don't<br>try to predict whether a startup will win, but to notice quickly<br>that it already is winning. They care what the market thinks of<br>you and what other VCs think of you, and they can't judge those<br>just from meeting you.<br>Because they're investing in things that (a) change fast and (b)<br>they don't understand, a lot of investors will reject you in a way<br>that can later be claimed not to have been a rejection. Unless you<br>know this world, you may not even realize you've been rejected.<br>Here's a VC saying no:<br>> We're really excited about your project, and we want to keep in<br>>  close touch as you develop it further.<br>Translated into more straightforward language, this means: We're<br>not investing in you, but we may change our minds if it looks like<br>you're taking off. Sometimes they're more candid and say explicitly<br>that they need to "see some traction." They'll invest in you if<br>you start to get lots of users. But so would any VC. So all they're<br>saying is that you're still at square 1.<br>Here's a test for deciding whether a VC's response was yes or no.<br>Look down at your hands. Are you holding a termsheet?<br>**22\. You need investors.**<br>Some founders say "Who needs investors?" Empirically the answer<br>seems to be: everyone who wants to succeed. Practically every<br>successful startup takes outside investment at some point.<br>Why? What the people who think they don't need investors forget is<br>that they will have competitors. The question is not whether you<br>_need_ outside investment, but whether it could help you at all.<br>If the answer is yes, and you don't take investment, then competitors<br>who do will have an advantage over you. And in the startup world<br>a little advantage can expand into a lot.<br>Mike Moritz famously said that he invested in Yahoo because he<br>thought they had a few weeks' lead over their competitors. That<br>may not have mattered quite so much as he thought, because Google<br>came along three years later and kicked Yahoo's ass. But there is<br>something in what he said. Sometimes a small lead can grow into<br>the yes half of a binary choice.<br>Maybe as it gets cheaper to start a startup, it will start to be<br>possible to succeed in a competitive market without outside funding. <br>There are certainly<br>costs to raising money. But as of this writing the empirical<br>evidence says it's a net win.<br>**23\. Investors like it when you don't need them.**<br>A lot of founders approach investors as if they needed their<br>permission to start a company—as if it were like getting into<br>college. But you don't need investors to start most companies;<br>they just make it easier.<br>And in fact, investors greatly prefer it if you don't need them.<br>What excites them, both consciously and unconsciously, is the sort<br>of startup that approaches them saying "the train's leaving the<br>station; are you in or out?" not the one saying "please can we have<br>some money to start a company?"<br>Most investors are "bottoms" in the sense that the startups they<br>like most are those that are rough with them. When Google stuck<br>Kleiner and Sequoia with a $75 million premoney valuation, their<br>reaction was probably "Ouch! That feels so good." And they were<br>right, weren't they? That deal probably made them more than any<br>other they've done.<br>The thing is, VCs are pretty good at reading people. So don't try<br>to act tough with them unless you really are the next Google, or<br>they'll see through you in a second. Instead of acting tough, what<br>most startups should do is simply always have a backup plan. Always<br>have some alternative plan for getting started if any given investor<br>says no. Having one is the best insurance against needing one.<br>So you shouldn't start a startup that's expensive to start, because<br>then you'll be at the mercy of investors. If you ultimately want<br>to do something that will cost a lot, start by doing a cheaper<br>subset of it, and expand your ambitions when and if you raise more<br>money.<br>Apparently the most likely animals to be left alive after a nuclear<br>war are cockroaches, because they're so hard to kill. That's what<br>you want to be as a startup, initially. Instead of a beautiful<br>but fragile flower that needs to have its stem in a plastic tube<br>to support itself, better to be small, ugly, and indestructible.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>I may be underestimating VCs. They may play some behind the scenes <br>role in IPOs, which you ultimately need if you want to create a silicon <br>valley.<br>\[2\]<br>A few VCs have an email address you can send your business<br>plan to, but the number of startups that get funded this way is<br>basically zero. You should always get a personal introduction—and <br>to a partner, not an associate.<br>\[3\]<br>Several people have told us that the most valuable thing about <br>[startup school](http://startupschool.org/) <br>was that they got to see famous startup founders and realized<br>they were just ordinary guys. Though we're happy to provide this<br>service, this is not generally the way we pitch startup school to<br>potential speakers.<br>\[4\]<br>Actually this sounds to me like a VC who got buyer's remorse,<br>then used a technicality to get out of the deal. But it's telling<br>that it even seemed a plausible excuse.<br>**Thanks** to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Hutch Fishman, and Robert <br>Morris for reading drafts of<br>this, and to Kenneth King of ASES for inviting me to speak.<br>![](http://ycombinator.com/images/y18.gif)[Comment](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17947) on this essay. |
