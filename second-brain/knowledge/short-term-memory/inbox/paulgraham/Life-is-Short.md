| ![Life is Short](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/life-is-short-4.gif)<br>January 2016<br>Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder<br>about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining<br>about its finiteness? Would we be just as likely to feel life was<br>short if we lived 10 times as long?<br>Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped<br>wondering about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer<br>the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.<br>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time,<br>into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year<br>old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only<br>get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it's<br>impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity<br>like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8<br>peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would<br>definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.<br>Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know<br>that?<br>It has for me. It means arguments of the form "Life is too short<br>for x" have great force. It's not just a figure of speech to say<br>that life is too short for something. It's not just a synonym for<br>annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for<br>something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.<br>When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word<br>that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is<br>somewhat tautological. It's almost the definition of bullshit that<br>it's the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does<br>have a distinctive character. There's something fake about it.<br>It's the junk food of experience.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/vb.html#f1n)\]<br>If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit,<br>you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless<br>disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's<br>mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.<br>There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's<br>either forced on you, or it tricks you. To some extent you have to<br>put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances. You need<br>to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. Indeed,<br>the law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some<br>kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it. It may be that<br>less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. There has<br>always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and<br>go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional<br>sense, but life feels more authentic. This could become more common.<br>You can do it on a smaller scale without moving. The amount of<br>time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers. Most<br>large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it. But<br>if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors<br>like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will<br>waste less of your time.<br>If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the<br>level of individual customers. If you fire or avoid toxic customers,<br>you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than<br>you decrease your income.<br>But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the<br>bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's<br>fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder<br>to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you. Things that<br>lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at<br>tricking you. An example that will be familiar to a lot of people<br>is arguing online. When someone<br>contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty<br>overtly. Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. But<br>like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we<br>now live in. Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of<br>the time not to defend yourself. Otherwise these people are literally<br>taking your life.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/vb.html#f2n)\]<br>Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more<br>dangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct<br>of technical progress is that things we like tend to become [more\<br>addictive](https://paulgraham.com/addiction.html). Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious<br>effort to avoid addictions â€” to stand outside ourselves and ask "is<br>this how I want to be spending my time?"<br>As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things<br>that matter. But different things matter to different people, and<br>most have to learn what matters to them. A few are lucky and realize<br>early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing,<br>and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it. But<br>most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that<br>matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish<br>between them.<br>For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the<br>artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and<br>high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important<br>thing in the world. But when you ask adults what they got wrong<br>at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids<br>thought of them.<br>One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask<br>yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff<br>that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's<br>how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape<br>jabs into your consciousness like a pin.<br>The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would<br>call "important." Having coffee with a friend matters. You won't<br>feel later like that was a waste of time.<br>One great thing about having small children is that they make you<br>spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as<br>you're staring at your phone and say "will you play with me?" And<br>odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.<br>If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by<br>surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things<br>for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write<br>that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize<br>the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people<br>die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd<br>spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there.<br>And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an<br>illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I<br>did.<br>The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to<br>be consciously aware of it. Back when life was more precarious,<br>people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a<br>bit morbid. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer<br>to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at<br>everyone's shoulder. Perhaps a better solution is to look at the<br>problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about<br>the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that<br>mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother. You don't<br>need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.<br>Just don't wait.<br>I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much<br>of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Both<br>make sense here.<br>How you live affects how long you live. Most people could do better.<br>Me among them.<br>But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention<br>to the time you have. It's easy to let the days rush by. The<br>"flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin<br>that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry<br>of errands and alarms. One of the most striking things I've read<br>was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's _Burning_<br>_the Days_.<br>It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it.<br>Kids help. When you have small children, there are a lot of moments<br>so perfect that you can't help noticing.<br>It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of<br>some experience. The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just<br>that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have<br>done that we didn't. My oldest son will be 7 soon. And while I<br>miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets<br>over what might have been. We had the best time a daddy and a 3<br>year old ever had.<br>Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter,<br>and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was<br>one that had other meanings. But then I realized the other meanings<br>are fairly closely related. Bullshit in the sense of things you<br>waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.<br>\[2\]<br>I chose this example deliberately as a note to self. I get<br>attacked a lot online. People tell the craziest lies about me.<br>And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the<br>natural human inclination to say "Hey, that's not true!"<br>**Thanks** to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts<br>of this. |
