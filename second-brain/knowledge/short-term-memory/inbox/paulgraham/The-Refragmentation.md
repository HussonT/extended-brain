| ![The Refragmentation](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-refragmentation-4.gif)<br>January 2016<br>One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in<br>your lifetime. A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation. US<br>politics is much more polarized than it used to be. Culturally we<br>have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful<br>of happy cities, abandoning the rest. And increasing economic<br>inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too.<br>I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances<br>of the same phenomenon. And moreover, that the cause is not some<br>force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces<br>that had been pushing us together.<br>Worse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces<br>that were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combination<br>of circumstances that's unlikely to be repeated — and indeed, that<br>we would not want to repeat.<br>The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of<br>large corporations.<br>The effects of World War II were both economic and social.<br>Economically, it decreased variation in income. Like all modern<br>armed forces, America's were socialist economically. From each<br>according to his ability, to each according to his need. More or<br>less. Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher<br>ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they<br>got was fixed according to their rank. And the flattening effect<br>wasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was<br>conscripted too. Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the<br>National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to<br>flatness. And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive<br>that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.<br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f1n)\]<br>Business owners weren't supposed to be making money either. FDR<br>said "not a single war millionaire" would be permitted. To ensure<br>that, any increase in a company's profits over prewar levels was<br>taxed at 85%. And when what was left after corporate taxes reached<br>individuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.<br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f2n)\]<br>Socially too the war tended to decrease variation. Over 16 million<br>men and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought<br>together in a way of life that was literally uniform. Service rates<br>for men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working toward<br>a common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together.<br>Though strictly speaking World War II lasted less than 4 years for<br>the US, its effects lasted longer. Wars make central governments<br>more powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this. In<br>the US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government<br>was slow to give up the new powers it had acquired. Indeed, in<br>some respects the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched<br>to the Soviet Union. In tax rates, federal power, defense spending,<br>conscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked more<br>like wartime than prewar peacetime.<br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f3n)\]<br>And the social effects<br>lasted too. The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule team<br>in West Virginia didn't simply go back to the farm afterward.<br>Something else was waiting for him, something that looked a lot<br>like the army.<br>If total war was the big political story of the 20th century, the<br>big economic story was the rise of a new kind of company. And this<br>too tended to produce both social and economic cohesion.<br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f4n)\]<br>The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation.<br>General Electric, General Foods, General Motors. Developments in<br>finance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enabled<br>a new type of company whose goal was above all scale. Version 1<br>of this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companies<br>dominating each big market.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f5n)\]<br>The late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation,<br>led especially by J. P. Morgan. Thousands of companies run by their<br>founders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run by<br>professional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day. It seemed<br>to people at the time that this was the final state of things. John<br>D. Rockefeller said in 1880<br>> The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone,<br>>  never to return.<br>He turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the next<br>hundred years.<br>The consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued for<br>most of the 20th. By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind<br>writes, "the major sectors of the economy were either organized<br>as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic<br>corporations."<br>For consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, but<br>only a few of them. When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of most<br>things, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the market<br>there wasn't much to differentiate them.<br>One of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV.<br>Here there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV for<br>eggheads and communists. The programs that the 3 networks offered were<br>indistinguishable. In fact, here there was a triple pressure toward<br>the center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates<br>in conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs were<br>expensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so they<br>had to be suitable for everyone.<br>And not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at the<br>same time. It's difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of<br>millions of families would sit down together in front of their TV<br>set watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door<br>neighbors. What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen<br>every night. We were literally in sync.<br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f6n)\]<br>In a way mid-century TV culture was good. The view it gave of the<br>world was like you'd find in a children's book, and it probably had<br>something of the effect that (parents hope) children's books have<br>in making people behave better. But, like children's books, TV was<br>also misleading. Dangerously misleading, for adults. In his<br>autobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images that<br>had just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can't show these to<br>families while they're having dinner.<br>I know how pervasive the common culture was, because I tried to opt<br>out of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives.<br>When I was 13 I realized, more from internal evidence than any<br>outside source, that the ideas we were being fed on TV were crap,<br>and I stopped watching it.<br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f7n)\]<br>But it wasn't just TV. It seemed<br>like everything around me was crap. The politicians all saying the<br>same things, the consumer brands making almost identical products<br>with different labels stuck on to indicate how prestigious they<br>were meant to be, the balloon-frame houses with fake "colonial"<br>skins, the cars with several feet of gratuitous metal on each end<br>that started to fall apart after a couple years, the "red delicious"<br>apples that were red but only nominally <br>apples. And in retrospect, it _was_ crap.<br>\[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f8n)\]<br>But when I went looking for alternatives to fill this void, I found<br>practically nothing. There was no Internet then. The only place<br>to look was in the chain bookstore in our local shopping mall. <br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f9n)\]<br>There I found a copy of _The Atlantic_. I wish I could say it became<br>a gateway into a wider world, but in fact I found it boring and<br>incomprehensible. Like a kid tasting whisky for the first time and<br>pretending to like it, I preserved that magazine as carefully as<br>if it had been a book. I'm sure I still have it somewhere. But<br>though it was evidence that there was, somewhere, a world that<br>wasn't red delicious, I didn't find it till college.<br>It wasn't just as consumers that the big companies made us similar.<br>They did as employers too. Within companies there were powerful<br>forces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act.<br>IBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little<br>more extreme than other big companies. And the models of how to<br>look and act varied little between companies. Meaning everyone<br>within this world was expected to seem more or less the same. And<br>not just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspired<br>to it — which in the middle of the 20th century meant most people<br>who weren't already in it. For most of the 20th century, working-class<br>people tried hard to look middle class. You can see it in old<br>photos. Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.<br>But the rise of national corporations didn't just compress us<br>culturally. It compressed us economically too, and on both ends.<br>Along with giant national corporations, we got giant national labor<br>unions. And in the mid 20th century the corporations cut deals<br>with the unions where they paid over market price for labor. Partly<br>because the unions were monopolies. <br>\[ [10](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f10n)\]<br>Partly because, as<br>components of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew they<br>could safely pass the cost on to their customers, because their<br>competitors would have to as well. And partly because in mid-century<br>most of the giant companies were still focused on finding new ways<br>to milk economies of scale. Just as startups rightly pay AWS a<br>premium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focus<br>on growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to<br>pay a premium for labor. <br>\[ [11](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f11n)\]<br>As well as pushing incomes up from the bottom, by overpaying unions,<br>the big companies of the 20th century also pushed incomes down at<br>the top, by underpaying their top management. Economist J. K.<br>Galbraith wrote in 1967 that "There are few corporations in which<br>it would be suggested that executive salaries are at a maximum."<br>\[ [12](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f12n)\]<br>To some extent this was an illusion. Much of the de facto pay of<br>executives never showed up on their income tax returns, because it<br>took the form of perks. The higher the rate of income tax, the<br>more pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it. (In the<br>UK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would<br>even pay their kids' private school tuitions.) One of the most<br>valuable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave their<br>employees was job security, and this too didn't show up in tax<br>returns or income statistics. So the nature of employment in these<br>organizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic<br>inequality. But even accounting for that, the big companies paid<br>their best people less than market price. There was no market; the<br>expectation was that you'd work for the same company for decades<br>if not your whole career. <br>\[ [13](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f13n)\]<br>Your work was so illiquid there was little chance of getting market<br>price. But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seek<br>it. If the company promised to employ you till you retired and<br>give you a pension afterward, you didn't want to extract as much<br>from it this year as you could. You needed to take care of the<br>company so it could take care of you. Especially when you'd been<br>working with the same group of people for decades. If you tried<br>to squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing the<br>organization that was going to take care of _them_. Plus if<br>you didn't put the company first you wouldn't be promoted, and if<br>you couldn't switch ladders, promotion on this one was the only way<br>up. <br>\[ [14](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f14n)\]<br>To someone who'd spent several formative years in the armed forces,<br>this situation didn't seem as strange as it does to us now. From<br>their point of view, as big company executives, they were high-ranking<br>officers. They got paid a lot more than privates. They got to<br>have expense account lunches at the best restaurants and fly around<br>on the company's Gulfstreams. It probably didn't occur to most of<br>them to ask if they were being paid market price.<br>The ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by<br>starting your own company. That seems obvious to any ambitious<br>person now. But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept.<br>Not because starting one's own company seemed too ambitious, but<br>because it didn't seem ambitious enough. Even as late as the 1970s,<br>when I grew up, the ambitious plan was to get lots of education at<br>prestigious institutions, and then join some other prestigious<br>institution and work one's way up the hierarchy. Your prestige was<br>the prestige of the institution you belonged to. People did start<br>their own businesses of course, but educated people rarely did,<br>because in those days there was practically zero concept of starting<br>what we now call a [startup](https://paulgraham.com/growth.html): <br>a business that starts small and grows<br>big. That was much harder to do in the mid 20th century. Starting<br>one's own business meant starting a business that would start small<br>and stay small. Which in those days of big companies often meant<br>scurrying around trying to avoid being trampled by elephants. It<br>was more prestigious to be one of the executive class riding the<br>elephant.<br>By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious<br>companies had come from in the first place. It seemed like they'd<br>always been there, like the chemical elements. And indeed, there<br>was a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and<br>the origins of the big companies. Many of the big companies were<br>roll-ups that didn't have clear founders. And when they did, the<br>founders didn't seem like us. Nearly all of them had been uneducated,<br>in the sense of not having been to college. They were what Shakespeare<br>called rude mechanicals. College trained one to be a member of the<br>professional classes. Its graduates didn't expect to do the sort<br>of grubby menial work that Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford started<br>out doing. <br>\[ [15](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f15n)\]<br>And in the 20th century there were more and more college graduates.<br>They increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25%<br>in 2000. In the middle of the century our two big forces intersect,<br>in the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million World War II<br>veterans to college. Few thought of it in these terms, but the<br>result of making college the canonical path for the ambitious was<br>a world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford,<br>but not to be Henry Ford.<br>\[ [16](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f16n)\]<br>I remember this world well. I came of age just as it was starting<br>to break up. In my childhood it was still dominant. Not quite so<br>dominant as it had been. We could see from old TV shows and yearbooks<br>and the way adults acted that people in the 1950s and 60s had been<br>even more conformist than us. The mid-century model was already<br>starting to get old. But that was not how we saw it at the time.<br>We would at most have said that one could be a bit more daring in<br>1975 than 1965. And indeed, things hadn't changed much yet.<br>But change was coming soon. And when the Duplo economy started to<br>disintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once.<br>Vertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated because<br>it was more efficient to. Incumbents faced new competitors as (a)<br>markets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trump<br>economies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability.<br>Smaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly<br>narrow channels to consumers broadened. Markets themselves started<br>to change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. And<br>last but not least, the federal government, which had previously<br>smiled upon J. P. Morgan's world as the natural state of things,<br>began to realize it wasn't the last word after all.<br>What J. P. Morgan was to the horizontal axis, Henry Ford was to the<br>vertical. He wanted to do everything himself. The giant plant he<br>built at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in iron<br>ore at one end and sent cars out the other. 100,000 people worked<br>there. At the time it seemed the future. But that is not how car<br>companies operate today. Now much of the design and manufacturing<br>happens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companies<br>ultimately assemble and sell. The reason car companies operate<br>this way is that it works better. Each company in the supply chain<br>focuses on what they know best. And they each have to do it well<br>or they can be swapped out for another supplier.<br>Why didn't Henry Ford realize that networks of cooperating companies<br>work better than a single big company? One reason is that supplier<br>networks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself<br>seemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And the<br>second reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network<br>of cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their<br>efforts, and you can do that much better with computers. Computers<br>reduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d'etre<br>of corporations. That is a fundamental change.<br>In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous with<br>efficiency. In the late 20th century they were synonymous with<br>inefficiency. To some extent this was because the companies<br>themselves had become sclerotic. But it was also because our<br>standards were higher.<br>It wasn't just within existing industries that change occurred.<br>The industries themselves changed. It became possible to make lots<br>of new things, and sometimes the existing companies weren't the<br>ones who did it best.<br>Microcomputers are a classic example. The market was pioneered by<br>upstarts like Apple. When it got big enough, IBM decided it was<br>worth paying attention to. At the time IBM completely dominated<br>the computer industry. They assumed that all they had to do, now<br>that this market was ripe, was to reach out and pick it. Most<br>people at the time would have agreed with them. But what happened<br>next illustrated how much more complicated the world had become.<br>IBM did launch a microcomputer. Though quite successful, it did<br>not crush Apple. But even more importantly, IBM itself ended up<br>being supplanted by a supplier coming in from the side — from<br>software, which didn't even seem to be the same business. IBM's<br>big mistake was to accept a non-exclusive license for DOS. It must<br>have seemed a safe move at the time. No other computer manufacturer<br>had ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make if<br>other manufacturers could offer DOS too? The result of that<br>miscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones. Microsoft<br>now owned the PC standard, and the customer. And the microcomputer<br>business ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.<br>Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet.<br>That sort of thing did not happen to big companies in mid-century.<br>But it was going to happen increasingly often in the future.<br>Change happened mostly by itself in the computer business. In other<br>industries, legal obstacles had to be removed first. Many of the<br>mid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal government<br>with policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors.<br>This didn't seem as dubious to government officials at the time as<br>it sounds to us. They felt a two-party system ensured sufficient<br>competition in politics. It ought to work for business too.<br>Gradually the government realized that anti-competitive policies<br>were doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administration<br>it started to remove them. The word used for this process was<br>misleadingly narrow: deregulation. What was really happening was<br>de-oligopolization. It happened to one industry after another.<br>Two of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distance<br>phone service, which both became dramatically cheaper after<br>deregulation.<br>Deregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers in<br>the 1980s. In the old days the only limit on the inefficiency of<br>companies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of their<br>competitors. Now companies had to face absolute rather than relative<br>standards. Any public company that didn't generate sufficient<br>returns on its assets risked having its management replaced with<br>one that would. Often the new managers did this by breaking companies<br>up into components that were more valuable separately.<br>\[ [17](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f17n)\]<br>Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks<br>whose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of<br>executives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders. Version 2<br>was higher resolution: there were more companies, of more different<br>sizes, making more different things, and their relationships changed<br>faster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations,<br>but more was left to market forces. Which further accelerated the<br>fragmentation.<br>It's a little misleading to talk of versions when describing a<br>gradual process, but not as misleading as it might seem. There was<br>a lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with was<br>qualitatively different. The companies in the S&P 500 in 1958 had<br>been there an average of 61 years. By 2012 that number was 18 years.<br>\[ [18](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f18n)\]<br>The breakup of the Duplo economy happened simultaneously with the<br>spread of computing power. To what extent were computers a precondition?<br>It would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computing<br>power was a precondition for the rise of startups. I suspect it<br>was for most of what happened in finance too. But was it a<br>precondition for globalization or the LBO wave? I don't know, but<br>I wouldn't discount the possibility. It may be that the refragmentation<br>was driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was<br>driven by steam engines. Whether or not computers were a precondition,<br>they have certainly accelerated it.<br>The new fluidity of companies changed people's relationships with<br>their employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked<br>out from under you? Ambitious people started to think of a career<br>less as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might<br>be at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement)<br>between companies introduced more competition in salaries. Plus<br>as companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how much<br>an employee contributed to the company's revenue. Both changes<br>drove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramatically<br>in productivity, paying market price meant salaries started to<br>diverge.<br>By no coincidence it was in the early 1980s that the term "yuppie"<br>was coined. That word is not much used now, because the phenomenon<br>it describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a label<br>for something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots<br>of money. To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn't seem<br>worth naming. Why wouldn't young professionals make lots of money?<br>But until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was part<br>of what it meant to be a professional. Young professionals were<br>paying their dues, working their way up the ladder. The rewards<br>would come later. What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted<br>market price for the work they were doing now.<br>The first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in the<br>future. Nor did they work for big companies. They were professionals<br>working in fields like law, finance, and consulting. But their example <br>rapidly inspired their peers. Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they <br>wanted one too.<br>Underpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if<br>everyone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else<br>has to, or they can't get good people. And once started this process<br>spreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of<br>people's careers they can easily switch not merely employers but<br>industries.<br>But not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce to<br>get paid a lot. It was no coincidence that the first yuppies worked<br>in fields where it was easy to measure that.<br>More generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashioned<br>precisely because it was so rare for so long: that you could make<br>your fortune. As in the past there were multiple ways to do it.<br>Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing<br>zero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one's fortune,<br>the ambitious had to decide whether or not to. A physicist who<br>chose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice that<br>a physicist in 1960 didn't have to think about.<br>The idea even flowed back into big companies. CEOs of big companies<br>make more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is<br>prestige. In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige. They were<br>the winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as<br>little now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like<br>small fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making<br>millions from startups and hedge funds. They don't like that idea,<br>so now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they<br>had been getting. <br>\[ [19](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f19n)\]<br>Meanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end<br>of the economic scale. As big companies' oligopolies became less<br>secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus<br>less willing to overpay for labor. And as the Duplo world of a few<br>big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — some<br>of them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce their<br>monopolies. As a result workers' wages also tended toward market<br>price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended<br>to be lower. Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased<br>the need for some kind of work.<br>And just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic<br>cohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation.<br>People started to dress and act differently. Those who would later<br>be called the "creative class" became more mobile. People who didn't<br>care much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for<br>appearances' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for<br>increasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu,<br>and others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans<br>to driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs. Kids<br>who went to private schools or wished they did started to dress<br>"preppy," and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious<br>effort to look disreputable. In a hundred ways people spread apart.<br>\[ [20](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f20n)\]<br>Almost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing. Has<br>it been net good or bad? I don't know; the question may be<br>unanswerable. Not entirely bad though. We take for granted the<br>forms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones we<br>don't. But as someone who caught the tail end of mid-century<br>[conformism](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=well-adjusted&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3), <br>I can tell you it was no utopia.<br>\[ [21](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f21n)\]<br>My goal here is not to say whether fragmentation has been good or<br>bad, just to explain why it's happening. With the centripetal<br>forces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, what<br>will happen next? And more specifically, is it possible to reverse<br>some of the fragmentation we've seen?<br>If it is, it will have to happen piecemeal. You can't reproduce<br>mid-century cohesion the way it was originally produced. It would<br>be insane to go to war just to induce more national unity. And<br>once you understand the degree to which the economic history of the<br>20th century was a low-res version 1, it's clear you can't reproduce<br>that either.<br>20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in a<br>sense naturally. The war was due mostly to external forces, and<br>the Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase. If you want cohesion<br>now, you'd have to induce it deliberately. And it's not obvious<br>how. I suspect the best we'll be able to do is address the symptoms<br>of fragmentation. But that may be enough.<br>The form of fragmentation people worry most about lately is [economic inequality](https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html), and if you want to eliminate<br>that you're up against a truly formidable headwind that has<br>been in operation since the stone age. Technology.<br>Technology is<br>a lever. It magnifies work. And the lever not only grows increasingly<br>long, but the rate at which it grows is itself increasing.<br>Which in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth people<br>can create has not only been increasing, but accelerating. The<br>unusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century masked<br>this underlying trend. The ambitious had little choice but to join<br>large organizations that made them march in step with lots of other<br>people — literally in the case of the armed forces, figuratively<br>in the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had<br>wanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn't<br>have figured out how. But that constraint has gone now. Ever since<br>it started to erode in the 1970s, we've seen the underlying forces<br>at work again.<br>\[ [22](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f22n)\]<br>Not everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly.<br>But a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all their<br>peers get dragged along too.<br>\[ [23](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f23n)\]<br>And as long as it's possible to<br>get rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for<br>economic inequality to increase. Even if you eliminate all the<br>other ways to get rich. You can mitigate this with subsidies at<br>the bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enough<br>to discourage people from creating wealth, you're always going to<br>be fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in<br>productivity.<br>\[ [24](https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f24n)\]<br>That form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay. Or<br>rather, back to stay. Nothing is forever, but the tendency toward<br>fragmentation should be more forever than most things, precisely<br>because it's not due to any particular cause. It's simply a reversion<br>to the mean. When Rockefeller said individualism was gone, he was<br>right for a hundred years. It's back now, and that's likely to be<br>true for longer.<br>I worry that if we don't acknowledge this, we're headed for trouble.<br>If we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy<br>tweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus<br>the bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks. And then we'll<br>waste our time trying to eliminate fragmentation, when we'd be<br>better off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>Lester Thurow, writing in 1975, said the wage differentials<br>prevailing at the end of World War II had become so embedded that<br>they "were regarded as 'just' even after the egalitarian pressures<br>of World War II had disappeared. Basically, the same differentials<br>exist to this day, thirty years later." But Goldin and Margo think<br>market forces in the postwar period also helped preserve the wartime<br>compression of wages — specifically increased demand for unskilled<br>workers, and oversupply of educated ones.<br>(Oddly enough, the American custom of having employers pay for<br>health insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent<br>NWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.)<br>\[2\]<br>As always, tax rates don't tell the whole story. There were<br>lots of exemptions, especially for individuals. And in World War<br>II the tax codes were so new that the government had little acquired<br>immunity to tax avoidance. If the rich paid high taxes during the<br>war it was more because they wanted to than because they had to.<br>After the war, federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were<br>about the same as they are now. In fact, for the entire period since<br>the war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite<br>dramatic changes in tax rates. The lowest point occurred when<br>marginal income tax rates were highest: 14.1% in 1950. Looking at<br>the data, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that tax rates have had<br>little effect on what people actually paid.<br>\[3\]<br>Though in fact the decade preceding the war had been a time<br>of unprecedented federal power, in response to the Depression.<br>Which is not entirely a coincidence, because the Depression was one<br>of the causes of the war. In many ways the New Deal was a sort of<br>dress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during<br>wartime. The wartime versions were much more drastic and more<br>pervasive though. As Anthony Badger wrote, "for many Americans the<br>decisive change in their experiences came not with the New Deal but<br>with World War II."<br>\[4\]<br>I don't know enough about the origins of the world wars to<br>say, but it's not inconceivable they were connected to the rise of<br>big corporations. If that were the case, 20th century cohesion would<br>have a single cause.<br>\[5\]<br>More precisely, there was a bimodal economy consisting, in<br>Galbraith's words, of "the world of the technically dynamic, massively<br>capitalized and highly organized corporations on the one hand and<br>the hundreds of thousands of small and traditional proprietors on<br>the other." Money, prestige, and power were concentrated in the<br>former, and there was near zero crossover.<br>\[6\]<br>I wonder how much of the decline in families eating together<br>was due to the decline in families watching TV together afterward.<br>\[7\]<br>I know when this happened because it was the season Dallas<br>premiered. Everyone else was talking about what was happening on<br>Dallas, and I had no idea what they meant.<br>\[8\]<br>I didn't realize it till I started doing research for this<br>essay, but the meretriciousness of the products I grew up with is<br>a well-known byproduct of oligopoly. When companies can't compete<br>on price, they compete on tailfins.<br>\[9\]<br>Monroeville Mall was at the time of its completion in 1969<br>the largest in the country. In the late 1970s the movie _Dawn of_<br>_the Dead_ was shot there. Apparently the mall was not just the<br>location of the movie, but its inspiration; the crowds of shoppers<br>drifting through this huge mall reminded George Romero of zombies.<br>My first job was scooping ice cream in the Baskin-Robbins.<br>\[10\]<br>Labor unions were exempted from antitrust laws by the Clayton<br>Antitrust Act in 1914 on the grounds that a person's work is not<br>"a commodity or article of commerce." I wonder if that means service<br>companies are also exempt.<br>\[11\]<br>The relationships between unions and unionized companies can<br>even be symbiotic, because unions will exert political pressure to<br>protect their hosts. According to Michael Lind, when politicians<br>tried to attack the A&P supermarket chain because it was putting<br>local grocery stores out of business, "A&P successfully defended<br>itself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby<br>gaining organized labor as a constituency." I've seen this phenomenon<br>myself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political<br>pressure against Airbnb than hotel companies.<br>\[12\]<br>Galbraith was clearly puzzled that corporate executives would<br>work so hard to make money for other people (the shareholders)<br>instead of themselves. He devoted much of _The New Industrial_<br>_State_ to trying to figure this out.<br>His theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive,<br>and that modern corporate executives were, like (good) scientists,<br>motivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good<br>work and thereby earn the respect of their peers. There is something<br>in this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined<br>with self-interest explains much of observed behavior.<br>\[13\]<br>Galbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid<br>executives at 300 big corporations found that three quarters of<br>them had been with their company for more than 20 years.<br>\[14\]<br>It seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century<br>executive salaries were low partly because companies then were more<br>dependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives got<br>too much. This was certainly true in the beginning. The first big<br>company CEOs were J. P. Morgan's hired hands.<br>Companies didn't start to finance themselves with retained earnings<br>till the 1920s. Till then they had to pay out their earnings in<br>dividends, and so depended on banks for capital for expansion.<br>Bankers continued to sit on corporate boards till the Glass-Steagall<br>act in 1933.<br>By mid-century big companies funded 3/4 of their growth from earnings.<br>But the early years of bank dependence, reinforced by the financial<br>controls of World War II, must have had a big effect on social<br>conventions about executive salaries. So it may be that the lack<br>of movement between companies was as much the effect of low salaries<br>as the cause.<br>Incidentally, the switch in the 1920s to financing growth with<br>retained earnings was one cause of the 1929 crash. The banks now<br>had to find someone else to lend to, so they made more margin loans.<br>\[15\]<br>Even now it's hard to get them to. One of the things I find<br>hardest to get into the heads of would-be startup founders is how<br>important it is to do certain kinds of menial work early in the<br>life of a company. Doing [things that don't\<br>scale](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html) is to how Henry Ford got started as a high-fiber diet is<br>to the traditional peasant's diet: they had no choice but to do the<br>right thing, while we have to make a conscious effort.<br>\[16\]<br>Founders weren't celebrated in the press when I was a kid.<br>"Our founder" meant a photograph of a severe-looking man with a<br>walrus mustache and a wing collar who had died decades ago. The<br>thing to be when I was a kid was an _executive_. If you weren't<br>around then it's hard to grasp the cachet that term had. The fancy<br>version of everything was called the "executive" model.<br>\[17\]<br>The wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s was enabled by a<br>combination of circumstances: court decisions striking down state<br>anti-takeover laws, starting with the Supreme Court's 1982 decision<br>in Edgar v. MITE Corp.; the Reagan administration's comparatively<br>sympathetic attitude toward takeovers; the Depository Institutions<br>Act of 1982, which allowed banks and savings and loans to buy<br>corporate bonds; a new SEC rule issued in 1982 (rule 415) that made<br>it possible to bring corporate bonds to market faster; the creation<br>of the junk bond business by Michael Milken; a vogue for conglomerates<br>in the preceding period that caused many companies to be combined<br>that never should have been; a decade of inflation that left many<br>public companies trading below the value of their assets; and not<br>least, the increasing complacency of managements.<br>\[18\]<br>Foster, Richard. "Creative Destruction Whips through Corporate<br>America." Innosight, February 2012.<br>\[19\]<br>CEOs of big companies may be overpaid. I don't know enough<br>about big companies to say. But it is certainly not impossible for<br>a CEO to make 200x as much difference to a company's revenues as<br>the average employee. Look at what Steve Jobs did for Apple when<br>he came back as CEO. It would have been a good deal for the board<br>to give him 95% of the company. Apple's market cap the day Steve<br>came back in July 1997 was 1.73 billion. 5% of Apple now (January<br>2016) would be worth about 30 billion. And it would not be if Steve<br>hadn't come back; Apple probably wouldn't even exist anymore.<br>Merely including Steve in the sample might be enough to answer the<br>question of whether public company CEOs in the aggregate are overpaid.<br>And that is not as facile a trick as it might seem, because the<br>broader your holdings, the more the aggregate is what you care<br>about.<br>\[20\]<br>The late 1960s were famous for social upheaval. But that was<br>more rebellion (which can happen in any era if people are provoked<br>sufficiently) than fragmentation. You're not seeing fragmentation<br>unless you see people breaking off to both left and right.<br>\[21\]<br>Globally the trend has been in the other direction. While<br>the US is becoming more fragmented, the world as a whole is becoming<br>less fragmented, and mostly in good ways.<br>\[22\]<br>There were a handful of ways to make a fortune in the mid<br>20th century. The main one was drilling for oil, which was open<br>to newcomers because it was not something big companies could<br>dominate through economies of scale. How did individuals accumulate<br>large fortunes in an era of such high taxes? Giant tax loopholes<br>defended by two of the most powerful men in Congress, Sam Rayburn<br>and Lyndon Johnson.<br>But becoming a Texas oilman was not in 1950 something one could<br>aspire to the way starting a startup or going to work on Wall Street<br>were in 2000, because (a) there was a strong local component and<br>(b) success depended so much on luck.<br>\[23\]<br>The Baumol Effect induced by startups is very visible in<br>Silicon Valley. Google will pay people millions of dollars a year<br>to keep them from leaving to start or join startups.<br>\[24\]<br>I'm not claiming variation in productivity is the only cause<br>of economic inequality in the US. But it's a significant cause, and<br>it will become as big a cause as it needs to, in the sense that if<br>you ban other ways to get rich, people who want to get rich will<br>use this route instead.<br>**Thanks** to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick<br>Collison, Ron Conway, Chris Dixon, Benedict Evans, Richard Florida,<br>Ben Horowitz, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Tim O'Reilly, Geoff<br>Ralston, Max Roser, Alexia Tsotsis, and Qasar Younis for reading<br>drafts of this.
