| ![What I Worked On](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/what-i-worked-on-4.gif)<br>February 2021<br>Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,<br>were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what<br>beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still<br>are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,<br>just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them<br>deep.<br>The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our<br>school district used for what was then called "data processing."<br>This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's<br>1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and<br>my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like<br>a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking<br>machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up<br>on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.<br>The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to<br>type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader<br>and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The<br>result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly<br>loud printer.<br>I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with<br>it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.<br>The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,<br>and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other<br>option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate<br>approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything<br>interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any<br>programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest<br>memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not<br>to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without<br>time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as<br>the data center manager's expression made clear.<br>With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a<br>computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond<br>to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through<br>a stack of punch cards and then stopping. <br>\[ [1](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f1n)\]<br>The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.<br>It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed<br>and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing<br>programs right into the computer.<br>Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of<br>nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about<br>1980\. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was<br>good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote<br>simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would<br>fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one<br>book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so<br>he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a<br>lot better than a typewriter.<br>Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.<br>In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more<br>powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study<br>of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in<br>other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when<br>I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the<br>space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed<br>ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases<br>that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.<br>I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at<br>the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept<br>being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.<br>AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things<br>especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein<br>called _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, which featured an intelligent<br>computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry<br>Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading _The Moon is a Harsh_<br>_Mistress_, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it<br>I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of<br>time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,<br>it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had<br>to do was teach SHRDLU more words.<br>There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate<br>classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning<br>Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.<br>The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,<br>and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at<br>Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation<br>was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program<br>so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where<br>the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had<br>expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was<br>supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a<br>roll. I knew what I was going to do.<br>For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God<br>did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,<br>but what made it even more exciting was my belief — hard to imagine<br>now, but not unique in 1985 — that it was already climbing the<br>lower slopes of intelligence.<br>I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose<br>a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose<br>whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose "Artificial<br>Intelligence." When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed<br>to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as<br>scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly<br>accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.<br>I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for<br>AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves<br>went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the<br>type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,<br>so that was where I went.<br>I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a<br>specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized<br>that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the<br>sort of AI in which a program that's told "the dog is sitting on<br>the chair" translates this into some formal representation and adds<br>it to the list of things it knows.<br>What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of<br>natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.<br>It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they<br>could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,<br>in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole<br>way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,<br>was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,<br>generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various<br>band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to<br>get us Mike.<br>So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage<br>of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp<br>was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association<br>with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about<br>it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided<br>to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little<br>I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But<br>there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you<br>learn it. The book, _On Lisp_, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote<br>much of it in grad school.<br>Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory<br>and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people<br>build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for<br>theory — indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable<br>of the two halves — but building things seemed so much more exciting.<br>The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.<br>Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete<br>in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in<br>footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would<br>seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of<br>the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.<br>There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer<br>lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could<br>have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present<br>standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so<br>off they went. That was what happened to systems work.<br>I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would<br>last.<br>In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at<br>CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the<br>Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While<br>looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem<br>obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,<br>was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't<br>become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.<br>And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not<br>as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought<br>if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to<br>be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could<br>be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get<br>research funding.<br>I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had<br>no idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually<br>that people made art — that it didn't just appear spontaneously<br>— but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.<br>They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange<br>things in profiles in _Life_ magazine. The idea of actually being<br>able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost<br>miraculous.<br>That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students<br>could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,<br>was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I<br>was taking, he never said anything.<br>So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to<br>be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and<br>working away at _On Lisp_. In other words, like many a grad student,<br>I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my<br>thesis.<br>I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out<br>of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember<br>when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing<br>the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a<br>spectacular way to get out of grad school.<br>Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into<br>professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate<br>that June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in<br>what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I<br>decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that<br>remained before the deadline, reusing parts of _On Lisp_ where I<br>could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay "Yes,<br>I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days."<br>I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect<br>I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's<br>a whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted<br>was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation<br>sufficed, just barely.<br>Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in<br>the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because<br>it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted<br>me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence<br>I went.<br>I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that<br>I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,<br>because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different<br>ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do<br>the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that<br>everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,<br>and design.<br>Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from<br>the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to<br>Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me<br>to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only<br>weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I<br>had some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;<br>there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now<br>all I had to do was learn Italian.<br>Only _stranieri_ (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In<br>retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because<br>there were so many _stranieri_ attracted by the idea of studying<br>art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been<br>outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the<br>RISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed<br>to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay<br>question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the<br>intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited<br>vocabulary. <br>\[ [2](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f2n)\]<br>I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.<br>Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in<br>the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again<br>about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting<br>department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,<br>but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the<br>students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in<br>return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.<br>And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the<br>conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those<br>little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century<br>studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible<br>without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides<br>me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally<br>trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.<br>Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made<br>a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a<br>local antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a<br>book, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look<br>old. <br>\[ [3](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f3n)\]<br>While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still<br>lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because<br>the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of<br>canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still<br>lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as<br>its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about<br>15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.<br>So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint<br>a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person<br>you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy<br>pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop<br>there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what<br>makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.<br>You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,<br>that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is<br>that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things<br>you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not<br>just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic<br>sense. <br>\[ [4](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f4n)\]<br>I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was<br>seeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're<br>seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes<br>that merely tell your brain "that's a water droplet" without telling<br>you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or<br>"that's a bush" without telling you the shape and position of every<br>leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it<br>would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when<br>you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and<br>when you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new<br>things after days of trying to paint something people usually take<br>for granted, just as you can  after<br>days of trying to write an essay about something people usually<br>take for granted.<br>This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a<br>good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth<br>trying.<br>Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked<br>hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of<br>passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me<br>anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the<br>end of the first year I went back to the US.<br>I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very<br>expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to<br>RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which<br>made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?<br>Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat<br>high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.<br>\[ [5](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f5n)\]<br>Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd<br>added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a<br>dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in<br>it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I<br>hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad<br>employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and<br>since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood<br>most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was<br>back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain<br>working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the<br>rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at<br>the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I<br>spent much of my time surreptitiously working on _On Lisp_, which I<br>had by this time gotten a contract to publish.<br>The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially<br>by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the<br>rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was<br>getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was<br>just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to<br>save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.<br>I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly<br>about what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology<br>companies to be run by product people than sales people (though<br>sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good<br>at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,<br>that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that<br>planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,<br>bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that<br>there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the<br>optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal<br>place for it.<br>But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both<br>Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:<br>that it's good to be the "entry level" option, even though that<br>will be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will<br>be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means<br>that prestige is a danger sign.<br>When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do<br>freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and<br>this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came<br>back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new<br>thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of<br>SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at<br>Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big<br>part of my life.<br>In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.<br>The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had<br>been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art<br>school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.<br>Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was<br>now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship<br>to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the<br>painting department. The textile department, which my next door<br>neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt<br>illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.<br>Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the<br>more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive<br>signature style.<br>A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business<br>is known as a "schtick": something that immediately identifies the<br>work as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting<br>that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy<br>Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in<br>the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions<br>of dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature<br>style, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.<br>\[ [6](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f6n)\]<br>There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who "could draw"<br>in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the<br>best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They<br>tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,<br>but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not<br>one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was<br>definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style<br>seekers.<br>I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I<br>was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for<br>free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,<br>and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A<br>rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New<br>York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than<br>my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists<br>were. So yes, I wanted it!<br>\[ [7](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f7n)\]<br>Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul<br>that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do<br>something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the<br>Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least<br>wasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.<br>Now I was a New York artist — in the strictly technical sense of<br>making paintings and living in New York.<br>I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was<br>on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I<br>didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those<br>days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose<br>for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.<br>This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used<br>as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties<br>and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of<br>this book, _ANSI Common Lisp_, is one that I painted around this<br>time.)<br>The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and<br>Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early<br>photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've<br>never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers<br>of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I<br>moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.<br>She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.<br>One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there<br>was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't<br>that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly<br>occurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work<br>on whatever I want.<br>Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called<br>the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited<br>him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It<br>seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical<br>user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It<br>seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.<br>If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.<br>I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided<br>we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't<br>honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that<br>this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art<br>galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy<br>ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate<br>web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and<br>set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up<br>galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.<br>It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites<br>for them for free, but none paid us.<br>Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that<br>except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd<br>been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called<br>an "internet storefront" was something we already knew how to build.<br>So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy<br>of _ANSI Common Lisp_ to the publishers, we started trying to write<br>software to build online stores. At first this was going to be<br>normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.<br>That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to<br>write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix<br>world. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store<br>builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new<br>site generator for stores — in Lisp, of course.<br>We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate<br>was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his<br>room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a<br>mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress<br>I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran<br>the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking<br>on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'<br>computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve<br>them from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.<br>This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at<br>the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,<br>we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you<br>could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August<br>12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you<br>could build a whole store through the browser, without any client<br>software or typing anything into the command line on the server.<br>Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a<br>whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't<br>need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there<br>had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to<br>be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.<br>Now you could just update the software right on the server.<br>We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our<br>software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding<br>from Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the<br>initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%<br>of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y<br>Combinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because<br>we'd needed it ourselves.<br>At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand<br>dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by<br>what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside<br>the proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?<br>No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,<br>I needed that seed funding to live on.<br>We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious<br>about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to<br>build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating<br>pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be<br>generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,<br>the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the<br>server.<br>It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online<br>store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking<br>legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts<br>and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his<br>bedroom look more legit than a big company.<br>(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because<br>it's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but<br>in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)<br>In September, Robert rebelled. "We've been working on this for a<br>month," he said, "and it's still not done." This is funny in<br>retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years<br>later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,<br>and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.<br>He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because<br>at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything<br>in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with<br>him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a<br>frighteningly effective hacker.<br>It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two<br>most [independent-minded](https://paulgraham.com/think.html) people <br>I know, and in completely different<br>ways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a<br>colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's<br>it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.<br>We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just<br>as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were<br>late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of<br>talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually<br>wanted online stores.<br>\[ [8](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f8n)\]<br>There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which<br>people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,<br>which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and<br>statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one<br>of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight<br>and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's<br>and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do<br>was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the<br>easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of<br>it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were<br>instead the most stressful.<br>There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second<br>half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not<br>the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It<br>was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make<br>Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a<br>month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low<br>price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of<br>competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we<br>set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.<br>$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.<br>We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,<br>we did what's now called "doing things that <br>[don't scale](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html)," although<br>at the time we would have described it as "being so lame that we're<br>driven to the most desperate measures to get users." The most common<br>of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly<br>humiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that<br>people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get<br>users.<br>We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For<br>example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt<br>(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better<br>to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.<br>The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to<br>rescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were<br>so beautiful too.<br>Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.<br>Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it<br>felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled<br>by "business" and thought we needed a "business person" to be in<br>charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,<br>in much the same way I was converted to <br>[fatherhood](https://paulgraham.com/kids.html) once I had kids.<br>Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have<br>so many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in<br>the meantime there was nothing more important to do.<br>Another thing I didn't get at the time is that <br>[growth rate](https://paulgraham.com/growth.html) is the<br>ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about<br>70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I<br>mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number<br>of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that<br>that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,<br>you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate<br>takes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was<br>advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed<br>out, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't<br>hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then<br>you'll control your own destiny.<br>Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted<br>me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the<br>Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would<br>have seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about<br>when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we<br>were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.<br>And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the<br>result was a mess even by startup standards.<br>It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb<br>stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable<br>and growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had<br>no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of<br>the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor<br>had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we<br>started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to<br>riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow<br>1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were<br>by far the most luxurious thing I owned.<br>The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must<br>have been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at<br>the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running<br>Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue<br>my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue<br>combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged<br>[culture](https://paulgraham.com/yahoo.html) and grim cube farm<br>in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it<br>felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.<br>Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the<br>time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth<br>anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next<br>year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the<br>summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything<br>that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been<br>entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had<br>done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now<br>I was rich, so I should go paint.<br>When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation<br>with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures<br>I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an<br>interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.<br>My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I<br>was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to<br>go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people<br>with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was<br>ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving<br>then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,<br>and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.<br>But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.<br>There was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.<br>Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their<br>companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's<br>what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing<br>for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.<br>So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or<br>ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people<br>in California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in<br>the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from<br>anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation<br>I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent<br>control you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed<br>up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and<br>there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't<br>know any of them.<br>When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was<br>rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,<br>except now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was<br>tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless<br>it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked<br>past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It<br>was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented<br>with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the<br>old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and<br>then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted<br>from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).<br>Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually<br>choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and<br>various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by<br>occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there<br>wasn't one. Huh.<br>Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear<br>from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why<br>not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit<br>code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting<br>applications for them?<br>\[ [9](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f9n)\]<br>You could run all sorts of services<br>on the servers that these applications could use just by making an<br>API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,<br>taking credit card payments, etc.<br>I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything<br>else. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly<br>want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would<br>have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and<br>start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but<br>there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and<br>though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into<br>working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.<br>So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly<br>refused to work on it.<br>Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had<br>worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and<br>we got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty<br>companies and several open source projects worth of software. The<br>language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of<br>Lisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt<br>Lisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan<br>did.<br>By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an<br>"application service provider," or ASP. This name didn't last long<br>before it was replaced by "software as a service," but it was current<br>for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going<br>to be called Aspra.<br>I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network<br>infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two<br>services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the<br>summer I realized I really didn't want to run a company — especially<br>not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd<br>only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't<br>need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be<br>realized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset<br>that could be done as an open source project.<br>Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not<br>wasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often<br>encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and<br>it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and<br>even trying to write some of it.<br>The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,<br>whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp<br>hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the<br>distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and<br>partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of<br>Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So<br>at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new<br>dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.<br>The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a<br>talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp<br>at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,<br>on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but<br>had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.<br>What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone<br>had posted it on Slashdot.<br>\[ [10](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f10n)\]<br>Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put<br>it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but<br>it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel<br>to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only<br>way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published<br>as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish<br>anything.<br>This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people<br>had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building<br>the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer<br>as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it<br>took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there<br>would be a whole new generation of <br>[essays](https://paulgraham.com/essay.html).<br>\[ [11](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f11n)\]<br>In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been<br>vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers<br>who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed<br>to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.<br>There were so many essays that had never been written, because there<br>had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going<br>to write them.<br>\[ [12](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f12n)\]<br>I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there<br>was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was<br>when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that<br>whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.<br>I knew that online essays would be a <br>[marginal](https://paulgraham.com/marginal.html) medium at first.<br>Socially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their<br>GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions<br>published in _The New Yorker_. But by this point I knew enough to<br>find that encouraging instead of discouraging.<br>One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how<br>well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't<br>prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form<br>of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started<br>them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what<br>I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish<br>on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in<br>something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.<br>It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when<br>you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current<br>lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to<br>be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.<br>Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is<br>going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.<br>So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee<br>you're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the<br>most common type of wrong one.<br>Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds<br>of different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a<br>book, called _Hackers & Painters_ after one of the essays in it. I<br>also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to<br>have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which<br>taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in<br>Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn<br>studio), to use as an office.<br>One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was<br>a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday<br>diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one<br>party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be<br>people they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests<br>was someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman<br>called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.<br>Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.<br>This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,<br>as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised<br>how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So<br>she decided to compile a book of <br>[interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1430210788) with startup founders.<br>When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her<br>staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed<br>for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make<br>up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about<br>all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They<br>should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a<br>handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical<br>founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as<br>CEO, and so on.<br>One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.<br>The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people<br>and tell them something that won't waste their time is a great<br>spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the<br>undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would<br>tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the<br>worst of the mistakes we'd made.<br>So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the<br>best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,<br>because then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed<br>they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect<br>of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),<br>I blurted out "But not me!" and went on with the talk. But afterward<br>it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about<br>angel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now<br>it was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.<br>Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects<br>we could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed<br>like there had to be something we could collaborate on.<br>As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the<br>corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.<br>Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd<br>start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd<br>been talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and<br>work for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.<br>\[ [13](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f13n)\]<br>Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to<br>be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways<br>to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,<br>and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.<br>There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure<br>them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.<br>In those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC<br>firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was<br>to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.<br>And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were<br>individuals who were usually focused on other things and made<br>investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough<br>in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,<br>because we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing<br>Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us<br>set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,<br>but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all<br>that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to<br>make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had<br>done for us.<br>YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we<br>funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,<br>but professional investors are thinking "Wow, that means they got<br>all the returns." But once again, this was not due to any particular<br>insight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.<br>It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we<br>wouldn't have known where to start.<br>\[ [14](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f14n)\]<br>The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a<br>bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three<br>months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we<br>discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due<br>to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as<br>investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch<br>of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech<br>companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where<br>they'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being<br>in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense<br>be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out<br>of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and<br>they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer<br>than they would working at Microsoft.<br>We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.<br>We'd all have dinner there once a week — on tuesdays, since I was<br>already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays — and after<br>dinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.<br>We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a<br>matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders<br>Program, and I posted an <br>[announcement](https://paulgraham.com/summerfounder.html) <br>on my site, inviting undergrads<br>to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way<br>to get "deal flow," as investors call it, but it turned out to be<br>the perfect source.<br>\[ [15](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f15n)\]<br>We got 225 applications for the Summer<br>Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them<br>were from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that<br>spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious<br>than we'd intended.<br>We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and<br>from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That<br>first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went<br>on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the<br>RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,<br>and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.<br>I don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.<br>You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the<br>Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place<br>like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.<br>The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did<br>with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students<br>got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the<br>typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to<br>be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had<br>taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought<br>the founders free air conditioners.<br>\[ [16](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f16n)\]<br>Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale<br>startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient<br>for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups<br>at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.<br>It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the<br>isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who<br>understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they<br>were solving them.<br>As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The<br>alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,<br>and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being<br>in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's<br>customers. We used to refer jokingly to the "YC GDP," but as YC<br>grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups<br>get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their<br>batchmates.<br>I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going<br>to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,<br>and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more<br>than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was<br>still able to work on other things.<br>In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version<br>of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into<br>Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was<br>originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and<br>was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of<br>reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders<br>we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed<br>the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's<br>intellectual curiosity.<br>HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest<br>source of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help<br>founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN<br>was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work<br>should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas<br>I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not<br>from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an<br>ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during<br>YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%<br>chance it had do with everything else combined.<br>\[ [17](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f17n)\]<br>As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But<br>while I continued to work a good deal _in_ Arc, I gradually stopped<br>working _on_ Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly<br>because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language<br>now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my<br>three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on<br>YC.<br>YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of<br>deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every<br>6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,<br>whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,<br>because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders<br>were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could<br>about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have<br>picked a better way to do it.<br>There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,<br>figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who<br>maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the<br>parts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once<br>said about companies: "No one works harder than the boss." He meant<br>it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second<br>part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked<br>set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better<br>work very hard.<br>One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,<br>Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited<br>advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at<br>Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested<br>that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.<br>That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I<br>remember his exact words very clearly. "You know," he said, "you<br>should make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do."<br>At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it<br>dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange<br>advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer<br>than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me<br>thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be<br>the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my<br>attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of<br>eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave<br>eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.<br>In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned<br>out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed<br>her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really<br>wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I<br>were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to<br>visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those<br>flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to<br>someone else.<br>I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so<br>we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and<br>Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.<br>Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we<br>four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to<br>do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said<br>yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and<br>Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.<br>When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he<br>said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.<br>But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided<br>he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest<br>of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could<br>learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose<br>cancer had returned.<br>She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was<br>still hard when it did.<br>I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups<br>through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still<br>talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested<br>in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)<br>What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about<br>that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided<br>I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused<br>on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.<br>I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was<br>at least completely engaging.<br>\[ [18](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f18n)\]<br>I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to<br>work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had<br>been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the<br>middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd<br>always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would<br>turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So<br>I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted<br>since. So far anyway.<br>I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum<br>game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project<br>that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's<br>getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was<br>some opportunity cost to screwing around.<br>I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over<br>the next few months. I even wrote a couple that <br>[weren't](https://paulgraham.com/know.html) about<br>startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.<br>The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language<br>defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally<br>intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was<br>meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the<br>Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language<br>in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?<br>The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,<br>is an answer to that question.<br>\[ [19](https://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f19n)\]<br>McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program<br>computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell<br>translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,<br>and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language<br>in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation<br>gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.<br>It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand<br>why at the time.<br>McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.<br>It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.<br>So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined<br>using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have<br>been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by<br>hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting<br>close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed,<br>there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more<br>complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers<br>then weren't powerful enough.<br>Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's<br>axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.<br>And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a<br>discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,<br>end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to<br>do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,<br>why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,<br>from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I<br>had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep<br>at it for so long.<br>I wrote this new Lisp, called [Bel](https://paulgraham.com/bel.html), <br>in itself in Arc. That may sound<br>like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery<br>I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious<br>collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an<br>interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,<br>but fast enough to test.<br>I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,<br>or I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing<br>essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely<br>understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as<br>because the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an<br>interpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's<br>happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted<br>by the time you get them.<br>So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people<br>about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have<br>seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder<br>than I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for<br>hours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone<br>asking "Does Paul Graham still code?"<br>Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively<br>that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head<br>and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the<br>coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some<br>problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the<br>tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that<br>because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news<br>is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.<br>In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to<br>see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a<br>British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only<br>meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still<br>live there. So most of Bel was written in England.<br>In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's<br>original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although<br>like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.<br>Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics<br>I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also<br>started to think about other things I could work on. How should I<br>choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the<br>past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I<br>was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If<br>this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would<br>be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with<br>similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others<br>to read, and this is the last sentence of it.<br>**Notes**<br>\[1\]<br>My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:<br>time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from<br>batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem<br>all the more exciting.<br>\[2\]<br>Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be<br>predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps<br>like _polluzione_). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you<br>string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,<br>you can make a little Italian go a long way.<br>\[3\]<br>I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia<br>went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across<br>the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,<br>and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at<br>street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter<br>evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with<br>tourists.<br>\[4\]<br>You can of course paint people like still lives if you want<br>to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex<br>of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce<br>pained expressions in the sitters.<br>\[5\]<br>Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and<br>built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law.<br>In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.<br>Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and<br>software companies like a bulldozer.<br>\[6\]<br>The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically<br>mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.<br>Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as<br>cool will soon become equally expensive.<br>\[7\]<br>Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but<br>rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would<br>know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less<br>than half market price.<br>\[8\]<br>Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when<br>the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the<br>stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully<br>obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch<br>privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and<br>making sure they had decent-looking stores.<br>\[9\]<br>We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their<br>own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp<br>expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the<br>code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers<br>visited them.<br>\[10\]<br>This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,<br>and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found<br>they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was<br>better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?<br>People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me<br>how sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply<br>that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It<br>comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they<br>[don't already know](https://paulgraham.com/useful.html), and some <br>people dislike being told such things.<br>\[11\]<br>People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of<br>course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing<br>it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as<br>the (or at least a) primary version.<br>\[12\]<br>There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y<br>Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long<br>after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary<br>VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,<br>been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more<br>expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap<br>and common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world,<br>just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints<br>of the print era.<br>Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.<br>less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected<br>by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).<br>Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which<br>fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and<br>venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay<br>writing would be?<br>\[13\]<br>Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were<br>called Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case<br>someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after<br>one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.<br>I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and<br>partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors<br>like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying<br>to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside<br>joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made<br>the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.<br>\[14\]<br>YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,<br>because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it<br>personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go<br>back to being self-funded.<br>\[15\]<br>I've never liked the term "deal flow," because it implies<br>that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This<br>is not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by<br>causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.<br>\[16\]<br>She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes,<br>because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get<br>whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could<br>carry now.<br>\[17\]<br>Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs<br>when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,<br>you're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every<br>conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post<br>highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually<br>these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination<br>is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations,<br>because the assumption that you're present in the conversation means<br>that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation<br>reads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn<br>encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses<br>that now is their chance.<br>\[18\]<br>The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica<br>anymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known<br>each other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from<br>our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted<br>tree.<br>\[19\]<br>One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs<br>discovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced<br>alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean<br>theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that<br>they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.<br>But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of<br>the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need<br>numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at<br>least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness<br>is preserved.<br>**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel<br>Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj<br>Taggar for reading drafts of this. |
