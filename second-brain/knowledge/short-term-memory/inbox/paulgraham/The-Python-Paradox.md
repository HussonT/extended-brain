| ![The Python Paradox](https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-python-paradox-2.gif)<br>August 2004<br>In a recent [talk](https://paulgraham.com/gh.html) I said something that upset a lot of<br>people: that you could get smarter programmers to work on<br>a Python project than you could to work on a Java project.<br>I didn't mean by this that Java programmers are dumb. I<br>meant that Python programmers are smart. It's a lot of<br>work to learn a new programming language. And people don't<br>learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it<br>because they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages they<br>already know.<br>Which makes them exactly the kind of programmers<br>companies should want to hire. Hence what, for lack of a better<br>name, I'll call the Python paradox: if a company chooses to write<br>its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they'll be able <br>to hire better programmers, because they'll attract only those<br>who cared enough to learn it. And for <br>programmers the paradox is even more pronounced: the language<br>to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language that<br>people don't learn merely to get a job.<br>Only a few companies have been smart enough to realize this <br>so far. But there is a kind of selection going on here too: they're <br>exactly the companies programmers would<br>most like to work for. Google, for example. When they <br>advertise Java programming jobs, they also want Python experience.<br>A friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languages<br>uses Python for most of his projects. He says the main reason<br>is that he likes the way source code looks. That may seem<br>a frivolous reason to choose one language over another.<br>But it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program,<br>you spend more time reading code than writing it.<br>You push blobs of source code around the way a sculptor does<br>blobs of clay. So a language that makes source code ugly is<br>maddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps<br>would be to a sculptor.<br>At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think<br>of Perl. But the superficial ugliness of Perl is not the sort<br>I mean. Real ugliness is not harsh-looking<br>syntax, but having to build programs out of the wrong<br>concepts. Perl may look like a cartoon character swearing,<br>but there are <br>[cases](https://paulgraham.com/icad.html) where it surpasses Python conceptually.<br>So far, anyway. Both languages are of course <br>[moving](https://paulgraham.com/hundred.html) targets. But they<br>share, along with Ruby (and Icon, and Joy, and J, and Lisp,<br>and Smalltalk) the fact that<br>they're created by, and used by, people who really care about<br>programming. And those tend to be the ones who do it well. |
