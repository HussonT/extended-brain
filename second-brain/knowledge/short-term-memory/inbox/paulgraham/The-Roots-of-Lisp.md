Among programmers it means a good programmer.<br>But the two meanings are connected. To programmers,<br>"hacker" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone<br>who can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer<br>wants to or not.<br>To add to the confusion, the noun "hack" also has two senses. It can<br>be either a compliment or an insult. It's called a hack when<br>you do something in an ugly way. But when you do something<br>so clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also<br>called a hack. The word is used more often in the former than<br>the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more<br>common than brilliant ones.<br>Believe it or not, the two senses of "hack" are also<br>connected. Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in<br>common: they both break the rules. And there is a gradual<br>continuum between rule breaking that's merely ugly (using<br>duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking<br>that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).<br>Hacking predates computers. When he<br>was working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to<br>amuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents.<br>This tradition continues today.<br>When we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much<br>time around MIT had<br>his own lock picking kit.<br>(He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)<br>It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would<br>want to do such things.<br>Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for<br>breaking into computers. This had only recently been declared<br>a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative<br>technique didn't work. Police investigation apparently begins with<br>a motive. The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex,<br>revenge. Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on<br>the FBI's list. Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to<br>them.<br>Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers'<br>general attitude of disobedience. But that disobedience is<br>a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.<br>They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate<br>newspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them<br>a certain problem can't be solved.<br>Suppress one, and you suppress the other.<br>This attitude is sometimes affected. Sometimes young programmers<br>notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to<br>adopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.<br>The fake version is not merely<br>annoying; the prickly attitude of these posers<br>can actually slow the process of innovation.<br>But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities,<br>the disobedient attitude of hackers is a net win. I wish its<br>advantages were better understood.<br>For example, I suspect people in Hollywood are<br>simply mystified by<br>hackers' attitudes toward copyrights. They are a perennial<br>topic of heated discussion on Slashdot.<br>But why should people who program computers<br>be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?<br>Partly because some companies use _mechanisms_ to prevent<br>copying. Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is<br>how to pick it. But there is a deeper reason that<br>hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents.<br>They see increasingly aggressive measures to protect<br>"intellectual property"<br>as a threat to the intellectual<br>freedom they need to do their job.<br>And they are right.<br>It is by poking about inside current technology that<br>hackers get ideas for the next generation. No thanks,<br>intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any<br>outside help. But they're wrong.<br>The next generation of computer technology has<br>often—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders.<br>In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing<br>what they expected to be<br>the next generation of business computer. They were mistaken.<br>The next generation of business computer was<br>being developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired<br>guys called Steve in a [garage](https://paulgraham.com/garage.html) in Los Altos. At about the<br>same time, the powers that be<br>were cooperating to develop the<br>official next generation operating system, Multics.<br>But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off<br>and wrote their own. They gave it a name that<br>was a joking reference to Multics: Unix.<br>The latest intellectual property laws impose<br>unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that<br>leads to new ideas. In the past, a competitor might use patents<br>to prevent you from selling a copy of something they<br>made, but they couldn't prevent you from<br>taking one apart to see how it worked. The latest<br>laws make this a crime. How are we<br>to develop new technology if we can't study current<br>technology to figure out how to improve it?<br>Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves.<br>Computers are responsible for the problem. The control systems<br>inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.<br>Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is<br>in software. And by this I mean software in the general sense:<br>i.e. data. A song on an LP is physically stamped into the<br>plastic. A song on an iPod's disk is merely stored on it.<br>Data is by definition easy to copy. And the Internet<br>makes copies easy to distribute. So it is no wonder<br>companies are afraid. But, as so often happens, fear has<br>clouded their judgement. The government has responded<br>with draconian laws to protect intellectual property.<br>They probably mean well. But<br>they may not realize that such laws will do more harm<br>than good.<br>Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws?<br>If I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this<br>mystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly<br>heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night,<br>I'd want to go out and investigate. Hackers are not stupid,<br>and unanimity is very rare in this world.<br>So if they're all squawking, <br>perhaps there is something amiss.<br>Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America,<br>will actually harm it? Think about it. There is something<br>very _American_ about Feynman breaking into safes during<br>the Manhattan Project. It's hard to imagine the authorities<br>having a sense of humor about such things over<br>in Germany at that time. Maybe it's not a coincidence.<br>Hackers are unruly. That is the essence of hacking. And it<br>is also the essence of Americanness. It is no accident<br>that Silicon Valley<br>is in America, and not France, or Germany,<br>or England, or Japan. In those countries, people color inside<br>the lines.<br>I lived for a while in Florence. But after I'd been there<br>a few months I realized that what I'd been unconsciously hoping<br>to find there was back in the place I'd just left.<br>The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.<br>In 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious<br>people you find now in America. (So I went back to America.)<br>It is greatly to America's advantage that it is<br>a congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness—that<br>it is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.<br>And hackers are invariably smart-alecks. If we had a national<br>holiday, it would be April 1st. It says a great deal about<br>our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a<br>horribly cheesy solution. When we cook one up we're not<br>always 100% sure which kind it is. But as long as it has<br>the right sort of wrongness, that's a promising sign.<br>It's odd that people<br>think of programming as precise and methodical. _Computers_<br>are precise and methodical. Hacking is something you do<br>with a gleeful laugh.<br>In our world some of the most characteristic solutions<br>are not far removed from practical<br>jokes. IBM was no doubt rather surprised by the consequences<br>of the licensing deal for DOS, just as the hypothetical<br>"adversary" must be when Michael Rabin solves a problem by<br>redefining it as one that's easier to solve.<br>Smart-alecks have to develop a keen sense of how much they<br>can [get away](https://paulgraham.com/say.html) with. And lately hackers <br>have sensed a change<br>in the atmosphere.<br>Lately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.<br>To hackers the recent contraction in civil liberties seems<br>especially ominous. That must also mystify outsiders. <br>Why should we care especially about civil<br>liberties? Why programmers, more than<br>dentists or salesmen or landscapers?<br>Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.<br>Civil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint<br>American tradition. Civil liberties make countries rich.<br>If you made a graph of<br>GNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you'd notice a definite<br>trend. Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather<br>than just an effect? I think so. I think a society in which<br>people can do and say what they want will also tend to<br>be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than<br>those sponsored by the most influential people.<br>Authoritarian countries become corrupt;<br>corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. <br>It seems to me there is<br>a Laffer curve for government power, just as for<br>tax revenues. At least, it seems likely enough that it<br>would be stupid to try the experiment and find out. Unlike<br>high tax rates, you can't repeal totalitarianism if it<br>turns out to be a mistake.<br>This is why hackers worry. The government spying on people doesn't<br>literally make programmers write worse code. It just leads<br>eventually to a world in which bad ideas win. And because<br>this is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive<br>to it. They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a<br>distance, as animals can sense an approaching <br>thunderstorm.<br>It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures<br>intended to protect national security and intellectual property<br>turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes <br>America successful. But it would not be the first time that<br>measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had<br>the opposite of the intended effect.<br>There is such a thing as Americanness.<br>There's nothing like living abroad to teach you that. <br>And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash<br>this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus<br>group than hackers, because they come closest of any group<br>I know to embodying it. Closer, probably, than<br>the men running our government,<br>who for all their talk of patriotism<br>remind me more of Richelieu or Mazarin<br>than Thomas Jefferson or George Washington.<br>When you read what the founding fathers had to say for<br>themselves, they sound more like hackers.<br>"The spirit of resistance to government,"<br>Jefferson wrote, "is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish<br>it always to be kept alive."<br>Imagine an American president saying that today.<br>Like the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of<br>the founding fathers have embarrassed generations of<br>their less confident successors. They remind us where we come from.<br>They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are<br>the source of America's wealth and power.<br>Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be<br>obeyed. But be careful what you ask for. You might get it.<br>**Thanks** to Ken Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Giffin, <br>Sarah Harlin, Shiro Kawai, Jessica Livingston, Matz, <br>Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Eric Raymond, Guido van Rossum,<br>David Weinberger, and<br>Steven Wolfram for reading drafts of this essay.<br>(The [image](https://paulgraham.com/bluebox.html) shows Steves Jobs and Wozniak <br>with a "blue box."<br>Photo by Margret Wozniak.
