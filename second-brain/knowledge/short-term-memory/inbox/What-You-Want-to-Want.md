# What You (Want to)* Want

## Essay by Paul Graham | November 2022

Since childhood, Paul Graham has been intrigued by the philosophical puzzle of free will and determinism. He recalls being around 9 years old and wondering about the apparent contradiction between:

1. Being made of matter that behaves predictably
2. Feeling capable of choosing one's actions

### The Initial Hypothesis

Graham proposes an initial framework: "You can do what you want, but you can't want what you want." However, he quickly identifies flaws in this statement by noting that people can:

- Change what they want
- Stop wanting something (like drug addicts)
- Develop desires for new things (wanting to like classical music)

### Refining the Concept

The essay explores increasingly nuanced iterations of desire, suggesting that while people can modify their wants, the ability becomes exponentially more difficult with each layer of "want to" added.

> You can do what you want, but there's some statement of the form "you can't (want to)* want what you want" that's true.

### Philosophical Conclusion

Ultimately, Graham argues that at some fundamental level, there are desires we do not control - a point of unavoidable determinism in human experience.

## Notes

Graham acknowledges that randomness in matter doesn't substantially change the philosophical problem, and credits Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reviewing drafts.
