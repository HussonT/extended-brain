# How to Lose Time and Money

## July 2010

When Paul Graham sold his startup in 1998, he suddenly acquired significant wealth and needed to understand how to prevent losing it. He realized that while he knew much about becoming rich, he knew little about becoming poor.

Graham discovered that fortunes are typically lost not through excessive spending, but through bad investments. He notes that "it's hard to spend a fortune without noticing" and that trading derivatives can cause massive financial losses quickly.

## Parallels Between Money and Time

Graham draws an interesting parallel between financial and time management, observing that the most dangerous way to lose time is not through pleasure, but through "fake work" - activities that seem productive but accomplish little.

Key insights include:

- Spending money on luxuries triggers immediate mental alarms
- Investments can bypass these traditional warning signals
- Similarly, time can be wasted through seemingly productive tasks like endless email processing

He argues that modern life has become more complex, creating "new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types."

## Conclusion

The essay emphasizes developing new mental frameworks to recognize unproductive behaviors in both financial investments and time management.
