# Do Things That Don't Scale

## Key Insights

In the early stages of a startup, you should deliberately do things that won't scale to get your first users and deeply understand their needs. Manual, high-touch approaches that seem inefficient are actually the most efficient way to learn and iterate quickly.

The key insight is that **startups don't start with scale** - they grow into it. What matters initially is learning, not efficiency.

## When to Apply

- **Initial user acquisition**: Manually recruit your first 10-100 users
- **Product development**: Build custom features for individual users to learn what generalizes
- **Customer support**: Founders should handle all support directly initially
- **Onboarding**: Manually onboard each user, even if it takes hours
- **Product delivery**: Consider "Collison installation" - manually set up the product for users

## Examples

### Airbnb
- Founders went door-to-door in New York
- Professionally photographed listings themselves
- Manually recruited both hosts and guests

### Stripe
- The Collison brothers would literally grab people's laptops and set up Stripe for them
- "Collison installation" became legendary in YC

### DoorDash
- Started with a simple landing page and phone number
- Founders personally delivered food orders
- No sophisticated logistics system initially

## Caveats & Limitations

- **Know when to transition**: Eventually you must build scalable systems
- **Don't get stuck**: Some founders enjoy the manual work too much and resist automation
- **Balance learning vs. growth**: Once you understand the pattern, start building for scale
- **Team expectations**: Make sure team understands this is temporary
