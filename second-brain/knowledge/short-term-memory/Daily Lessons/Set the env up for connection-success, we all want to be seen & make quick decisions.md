1. Become more present & connect better by setting the environment up right - (for example I’ve told Scarlett I would be with her in 1 minute when she started talking to me while I was finishing a text message to somebody) → she knew she was going to get my full attention in a minute - which made her feel seen & also set the situation up for full connection 1 minute later.
2. We all want to be seen - when in doubt, aknowledge someone - are you really scared somebody’s going think worse of you because you genuinly call out that you see them?
3. Get better at making decisions quickly - train your decision making muscle in the store, in the interactions you have with people when choosing a restaurant, … 2 way vs 1 way door decision - and always try to think of the way you can turn a seemingly 1 way door decision into a 2 way door decisio.
