1. Trust your intuitions & learn to follow them no matter what: if you trust your intuition and you’re wrong you’re gonna hate yourself less than if you don’t trust your intuition and are wrong
2. Spend the time to develop true conviction around the things that matter most to you and be unapologetic about the standards you set for yourself here and for other - you teach people how to treat you: work ethic, how you want to work, social interactions, etc.
3. Be dogmatic about certain things: always questioning yourself first can waste a lot of time because you might find that you were right all along and the situaatin you’re in is simply not upto your standard and that’s ok.
