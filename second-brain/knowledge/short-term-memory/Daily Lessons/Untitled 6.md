1. Don’t compromise on team
2. Everything, everything, everything flows from people - the most important first decision is who will you build with, then who will you sell to & then who will you partner with - in that order. If the first one doesn’t fully sit right, you’re going to be fucked for all the rest, because the only way to build fruitful relationships with people is through trust. And you gain people’s trust by delivering what you say you’re going to deliver. If you get the first bit wrong, you’ll end up short a lot of times in the subsequent sets of people that you’re aiming to connect with.
3. Your gut usually whispers until it’s too late - learn to listen to it as if it’s a roar.
