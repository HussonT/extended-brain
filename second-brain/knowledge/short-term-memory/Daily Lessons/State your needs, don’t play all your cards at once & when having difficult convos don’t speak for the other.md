PoA 1: State your needs - it’s an act of self-betrayal to not state your needs. That’s why I believe people pleasers are assholes

PoA 2: Don’t play all your cards at once. There’s a level of confidence that comes from knowing that you haven’t played all your best cards yet that in itself becomes a card.

PoA 3: When having a difficult conversation, don’t reframe the narrative too early. If you’re angry - experss it and give the other party the room to reframe the anger but if you do it for them, you’ll never know what they really thought.
