Meanwhile, the world has become extraordinarily unequal: as of 2015, the world’s richest 1 percent now own more wealth than all the other 99 percent put together.11 (Location 136)

Meanwhile over 80 percent of the world’s fisheries are fully or over-exploited and a refuse truck’s worth of plastic is dumped into the ocean every minute: at this rate, by 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the sea.14 (Location 144)

But inequality, it turns out, is not an economic necessity: it is a design failure. Twenty-first-century economists will recognise that there are many ways to design economies to be far more distributive of the value that they generate—an idea best represented as a network of flows. It means going beyond redistributing income to exploring ways of redistributing wealth, particularly the wealth that lies in controlling land, enterprise, technology, knowledge and the power to create money.

In other words, what determines the Doughnut’s ecological ceiling? To answer that question, we have to look back over the past 100,000 years of life on Earth. For almost all of that time—as early humans trekked out of Africa and blazed a trail across continents—Earth’s (Location 711)

Around 13 percent of people worldwide are malnourished. How much food would it take to meet their caloric needs? Just 3 percent of the global food supply. To put that in context, 30–50 percent of the world’s food gets lost post-harvest, wasted in global supply chains or scraped off dinner plates and into kitchen bins. (Location 879)

Like fire, it is extremely efficient at what it does, but dangerous if it gets out of control. When the market is unconstrained, it degrades the living world by over-stressing Earth’s sources and sinks. It also fails to deliver essential public goods—from education and vaccines to roads and railways—on which its own success deeply depends. At the same time, (Location 1218)

The preliminary sketches for this updated self-portrait are under way, revealing five broad shifts in how we can best depict our economic selves. First, rather than narrowly self-interested, we are social and reciprocating. Second, in place of fixed preferences, we have fluid values. Third, instead of isolated, we are interdependent. Fourth, rather than calculate, we usually approximate. And fifth, far from having dominion over nature, we are deeply embedded in the web of life. (Location 1538)

Likewise, as part of a forest conservation scheme in Chiapas, Mexico, many farmers are compensated in cash for refraining from cutting trees, hunting, poaching or expanding their herd of cattle. The more years that they participate in the scheme, however, the more their stated motivation to conserve the forest becomes financial rather than intrinsic, and their readiness for future conservation efforts depends increasingly upon the promise of future payments. In other parts of Chiapas, however, where the forest is managed through community planning and projects, it initially takes longer to generate the farmers’ engagement, but the social capital that they build is far greater and their motivation remains centred on the inherent benefits of long-term forest conservation.56 Bringing money into the mix, it seems, can significantly alter our regard for the living world.

That was the big mistake. We didn’t understand how risk was spread across the system, we didn’t understand the entanglements of different institutions with each other, and we didn’t understand—even though we talked about it—just how global things were.’ (Location 2228)

Just as a bathtub will only start to empty if water pours in from the tap more slowly than it drains out of the plughole, so carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere will only fall if new emissions flow in more slowly than CO2 is drawn out. When Sterman first drew the carbon bathtub in 2009, global annual inflows of CO2 were 9 billion tons, (Location 2314)

They came up with a user-friendly computer simulation, known as C-ROADS (short for Climate Rapid Overview and Decision Support) to help governments see the impacts of their policy plans. C-ROADS instantly adds up all nations’ greenhouse gas reduction pledges to show their combined long-term implications for global emissions, atmospheric concentrations, temperature change and sea-level rise.

Learn to find the ‘leverage points’, said Donella Meadows—those places in a complex system where making a small change in one thing can lead to a big change in everything. She believed that most economists spend too much time tweaking low leverage points, such as adjusting prices (which merely alters the rate of flow), when they could (Location 2399)

Third, be prudential in policymaking, seeking to minimise the risk of harm—especially to the most vulnerable—in the face of uncertainty.

‘The future can’t be predicted,’ wrote Donella Meadows, ‘but it can be envisioned and brought lovingly into being. Systems can’t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned . . . We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than can ever be produced by our will alone.’ (Location 2448)
