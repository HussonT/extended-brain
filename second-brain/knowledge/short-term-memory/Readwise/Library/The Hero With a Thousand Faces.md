Campbell brings this ancient idea into his work too. Borrowing the term monomyth, a word he identifies as one coined by James Joyce, he puts forth the ancient idea—that the mysterious energy for inspirations, revelations, and actions in heroic stories worldwide is also universally found in human beings.

Whosoever desires to explore The Way —   Let them set out—for what more is there to say? These words were written nine hundred years ago. They portray a timeless idea about how to journey to the curve around which one finds one's wholeness waiting. (Location 327)

There is a "hearing capacity" in the psyche. It loves to listen to all manner of nourishing, startling, and challenging dramatic patterns —the very ones found in tales. It matters little how the stories arrive—whether they take shape in day-time reveries, night-time dreams, or through the inspired arts, or are told simply by human beings in any number of ways. They are meant to be conveyed in blood-red wholeness and authentic depth. (Location 367)

Purposefully, or without awareness, this is done by focusing almost exclusively only on one or two story themes, inhibiting or forbidding all others, or only excessively touting a favorite one or two.

world in worse shape or in greater need of the lyrical, mystical, and common-sensical. There seem to be large and perpetual pockets where fair and sustaining values are more pale than they should be. But when we consider Plato, Strabbo, and the apostles Paul and John, and many others over the centuries, we see that they also wrote about their times as being likewise devoid of proper "management and meaning." It appears that "culture at edge of utter corruption" and "world at the edge of utter destruction" are two of the oldest themes to be found in stories of the human race. (Location 557)
