Overvaluing the idea is a red flag, particularly in the absence of tangible progress. Sure, I miss out on investing in some truly great ideas with this attitude, but that's okay with me: I don't invest in ideas. (Location 260)

Usage is like oxygen for ideas. You can never fully anticipate how an audience is going to react to something you've created until it's out there. That means every moment you're working on something without it being in the public arena, it's actually dying, deprived of the oxygen of the real world. (Location 470)

Focus on the smallest possible problem you could solve that would potentially be useful. Most companies start out trying to do too many things, which makes life difficult and turns you into a me-too. (Location 517)

In the world of startups, big ideas are one thing but execution is everything. The best entrepreneurs I know execute well by doing several things. Develop passion and vision for the problem they are trying to solve. Identify and understand what they have to do to make it happen. Combine sheer will, determination, and focus to make it happen with a healthy sense of urgency. (Location 704)

You can learn from those who are better, those who know more, or have done it before. Learning is a total blast—why wouldn't you want to have a blast? Every day people who have skills that you don't have will challenge you to develop, expand, and enhance your own set of skills. Great teams of people move much faster than teams of weak people, as great people feed off of each other. You want your company to do more faster, right? Time is always against you in a startup. Knowledge grows exponentially. The more your team knows, the more they can learn and ultimately will know. Better people are easier to manage and are more self-directed.

Temptation 1: Hiring too quickly. Just having a warm body in that open job that you need filled immediately doesn't get the job done. When you are hiring such a big percentage of your workforce, you have to have a super-high success rate. (Location 1110)

Temptation 2: Firing too slowly. Everyone's heard the analogy about a bad employee being like a cancer in an organization—his poor performance or attitude spread and he needs to be cut out to preserve the rest of the organization. (Location 1116)

While it can feel harder to remove a new employee who isn't working out, it's almost always better to make a clean break and try again as the effort to “fix the person” is likely greater than the time and effort to hire a better person, especially when time is your most precious resource.

However, this doesn't work for early stage startups. The sale is not what is important. In early stage startups, the relationship reigns supreme. Why? Because startups screw up a lot. If you have solid relationships, there is an allowance for failure. (Location 1237)
