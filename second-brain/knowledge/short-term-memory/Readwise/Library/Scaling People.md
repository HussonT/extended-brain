“You know why playing a game is fun? Because it has rules, and you have a way to win. Picture a bunch of people showing up at an athletic field with random equipment and no rules. Someone is going to get hurt. You don’t know how to play, you don’t know how to score, and you don’t know how to win.” It’s critical for companies and teams to establish the playing field on which everyone participates and marks progress.

Building on this work years later, psychology professors K. Anders Ericsson and Nina Keith conducted a study of intermediate-level typists in which they found that the ones who improved the most were those who dedicated themselves to a frequent practice of typing quickly.3 I first read about this insight in Joshua Foer’s book Moonwalking with Einstein, where it serves as a supporting story for Foer’s own work with Ericsson to improve his memorization skills.

These are the touchstones I’ve come back to often as I’ve navigated my management career, and they’re recurring themes in my management advice: Build self-awareness to build mutual awareness. Say the thing you think you cannot say. Distinguish between management and leadership. Come back to your operating system.

Chapter 4 Core Framework 3: Intentional Team Development This chapter covers how to turn a group of individuals into a team that is greater than the sum of its parts. It starts with a focus on setting up and structuring new teams, then moves on to daily teamwork, from communicating and decision-making to running meetings and offsites to handling reorganizations and managing distributed teams. It also discusses diversity, equity, and inclusion, which are critical to building high-functioning teams, and ends with some advice for setting your team up for success when you’re gone.

Chapter 5 Core Framework 4: Feedback and Performance Mechanisms All companies, regardless of stage or size, need to orient their culture around and provide a framework for giving feedback that fosters improvement. This doesn’t need to be complicated, especially at the beginning. It’s far better to start with a basic system and build on it as you go than to try to run a company with nothing in place. This chapter covers how to build those structures, including why it’s important to ensure no one is ever surprised by the feedback they receive; how to manage both high and low performers, as well as other managers; how to approach performance reviews, coaching, compensation, firing, and layoffs; and what to do when something bad happens to an employee.
