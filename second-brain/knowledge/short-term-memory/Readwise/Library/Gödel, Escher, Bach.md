"Which contains more information-a record, or the phonograph which plays it This odd question arises when the Tortoise describes a single record which, when played on a set of different phonographs, produces two quite different melodies: B-A-C-H and C-A-G-E. (Location 81)

This is what Artificial Intelligence (A1) research is all about. And the strange flavor of AI work is that people try to put together long sets of rules in strict formalisms which tell inflexible machines how to be flexible. What sorts of "rules" could possibly capture all of what we think of as intelligent behavior, however? Certainly there must be rules on all sorts (Location 595)

You now know that a computer so programmed would never stop. And this does not amaze you. But what if you asked a friend to try to generate U? It would not surprise you if he came back after a while, complaining that he can't get rid of the initial M, and therefore it is a wild goose chase. (Location 797)

Even if a person is not very bright, he still cannot help making some observations about what he is doing, and these observations give him good insight into the task-insight which the computer program, as we have described it, lacks. (Location 799)

It is very important when studying formal systems to distinguish working within the system from making statements or observations about the system. (Location 831)

Actually, in human affairs, it is often next to impossible to break things neatly up into "inside the system" and "outside the system"; life is composed of so many interlocking and interwoven and often inconsistent "systems" that it may seem simplistic to think of things in those terms. But it is often important to formulate simple ideas very clearly so that one can use them as models in thinking about more complex ideas. And that is why I am showing you formal systems; and it is about time we went back to discussing the MIU- system. M-Mode, I-Mode, U-Mode (Location 837)

We will occasionally refer back to these two modes of dealing with a formal system, and we will call them the Mechanic mode (M-mode) and the Intelligent mode (I-mode). (Location 850)

The tricky word here is "characterization". Certainly the rules of inference and the axioms of the MIU-system do characterize, implicitly, those strings that are theorems. Even more implicitly, they characterize those strings that are not theorems. But implicit characterization is not enough, for many purposes. If someone claims to have a characterization of all theorems, but it takes him infinitely long to deduce that some particular string is not a theorem, you would probably tend to say that there is something lacking in that characterization-it is not quite concrete enough.

Now, stressing the phrase "from its form alone" may seem silly; what else is there to a string except its form? What else could possibly play a roll in determining its properties? Clearly nothing could. But bear this in mint as the discussion of formal systems goes on; the notion of "form" will star to get rather more complicated and abstract, and we will have to think more about the meaning of the word "form".

This points out that there really is not much deep interest in formal systems with lengthening rules only; it is the interplay of lengthening and shortening rules that gives formal systems a certain fascination.. (Location 1017)

There is a "lower level" of our isomorphism-that is, a mapping between the parts of the two structures: p <= => plus q <= => equals - <= => one -- <= => two ---- <= => three etc. This symbol-word correspondence has a name: interpretation. Secondly, on a higher level, there is the correspondence between true statements and theorems. But-note carefully-this higher-level correspondence could not be perceived without the prior choice of an interpretation for the symbols. Thus it would be more accurate to describe it as a correspondence between true statements and interpreted theorems. (Location 1050)

Under si an interpretation, theorems and truths correspond-that is, an isomorphism exists between theorems and some portion of reality. That is why it is good to distinguish between interpretations and meanings. Any old word can be used as an interpretation for `p', but` plus' is the only meaningful choice we've come up with. In summary, the meaning of `p' seems to be 'plus’ though it can have a million different interpretations. (Location 1081)

Now, --p---q---- has a new interpretation: "2 equals 3 taken from 5". Of course it is a true statement. All theorems will come out true under this new interpretation. It is just as meaningful as the old one. Obviously, it is silly to ask, (Location 1107)

Can all of reality be turned into a formal system? In a very broad sense, the answer might appear to be yes. One could suggest, for instance, that reality is itself nothing but one very complicated formal system. Its symbols do not move around on paper, but rather in a three-dimensional vacuum (space); they are the elementary particles of which everything is composed. (Location 1130)

But in order to generate such a table, you would have to do some reasoning outside the system-reasoning which shows why various strings cannot be generated inside the system. Now it may well be that there is another formal system which can generate the "Table of Nontheorems", by purely typographical means. (Location 1356)

But there may be other passive meanings which are potentially perceptible, which no one has yet noticed. For instance, there were the surprise interpretations of p as "equals" and q as "taken from", in the original pq-system. Although this is rather a trivial example, it contains the essence of the idea that symbols may have many meaningful interpretations-it is up to the observer to look for them. (Location 1858)

In this case, it doesn't matter whether the individual statements are true c false-and perhaps there is no way to know which ones are true, and which are not. What is nevertheless certain is that not all three can be true at one Thus, the interpretation makes the system internally inconsistent. (Location 1881)

We have given two ways of looking at consistency: the first says that system-plus-interpretation is consistent with the external world if every theorem comes out true when interpreted; the second says that a system-plus: interpretation is internally consistent if all theorems come out mutually compatible when interpreted.

Roughly, then, it should be possible to establish different brands of consistency. For instance, the most lenient would be "logical consistency", putting no restraints on things at all, except those of logic. (Location 1904)

More specifically, a system-plus-interpretation would be logically consistent just as long as no two of its theorems, when interpreted as statements, directly contradict each other; and mathematically consistent just as long as interpreted theorems do not violate mathematics; and physically consistent just as long as all its interpreted theorems are compatible with physical law; then comes biological consistency, and so on.

We have stressed the fact, above, that internal consistency of a form; system (together with an interpretation) requires that there be some imaginable world-that is, a world whose only restriction is that in it, mathematics and logic should be the same as in our world-in which all the interpreted theorems come out true.

Tags: #insight/framework #insight/key-point #insight/principle
External consistency, however consistency with the external world-requires that all theorems come of true in the real world. Now in the special case where one wishes to create consistent formal system whose theorems are to be interpreted as statements of mathematics, it would seem that the difference between the two types of consistency should fade away, since, according to what we sat above, all imaginable worlds have the same mathematics as the real world.

If consistency is the minimal condition under which symbols acquire passive meanings, then its complementary notion, completeness, is the maximal confirmation of those passive meanings.

There, the trap was the idea that before you can use any rule, you have to have a rule which tells you how to use that rule; in other words, there is an infinite hierarchy of levels of rules, which prevents any rule from ever getting used. Here, the trap is the idea that before you can understand any message, you have to have a message which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an infinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from ever getting understood.

If, furthermore, we believe human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomena nature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts then presumably the "language" in which frame messages and outer sages are communicated among humans is a "dialect" of a universal gauge by which intelligences can communicate with each other. Thus, would be certain kinds of triggers which would have "universal triggering power", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them i same way as we do.
