We don’t have enough time to do our work, but we pack our days with endless meetings. We don’t have the information we need, but we are buried in emails, documents, and data. We want speed and innovation, but we run from risk and inhibit our best people. We claim to work in teams, but we don’t really trust one another. We know the way we’re working isn’t working, but we (Location 61)

Have you ever seen a colleague behave this way? Insist on doing everything through “channels.” Never permit shortcuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions. Make “speeches.” Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your “points” by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. When possible, refer all matters to committees for “further study and consideration.” Attempt to make the committees as large as possible—never less than five. Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible. Haggle over the precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions. Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to reopen the question of the advisability of that decision. Advocate “caution.” Be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on. Be worried about the propriety of any decision—raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon. When training new workers, give incomplete or misleading instructions. Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done. Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, paychecks, and so on. See that three people have to approve everything where one would do. Apply all regulations to the last letter. (Location 71)

One of the most popular solutions to this problem is the signal-controlled intersection. With an estimated 311,000 signals in the United States alone, nearly everyone on Earth is familiar with this approach. Now, if we consider this as an operating system, we can ask, What are the assumptions behind it? People cannot be trusted to manage the intersection on their own. They need to be told what to do. Complex problems must be managed with elaborate rules and technology, in the form of cables, lights, switches, and control centers, programmed to optimize the flow of traffic. We need a plan for every possible scenario, with multicolored signals, arrows, the ability to switch from solid to flashing lights, and so on. (Location 131)

Less prevalent, but still well known, is the roundabout. Here cars enter and exit a shared circle that connects all four directions of travel. This too represents an operating system—one that holds different assumptions about people and the problem. People can be trusted, and will trust one another, to use judgment and do the right thing. Complex problems can be managed with simple rules and agreements that leave room for judgment: give the right-of-way to vehicles already in the circle and go with the flow of traffic. Many scenarios will unfold in the roundabout, but social coordination will be sufficient to handle them. What stands out for you about these two approaches? Did you notice that the signal-controlled intersection doesn’t require much thinking? Only compliance. The roundabout, on the other hand, requires drivers to be present and responsible for their own safety and the safety of others. One allows for a surreptitious text message or two while we wait. The other one keeps things moving. One has a huge apparatus behind it, with control stations and staff monitoring the situation constantly. The other is left to its own devices. We have precious few roundabouts in the United States, about one for every 1,118 intersections. So you would assume that the signal-controlled intersection is superior. But which operating system actually produces the best results? Let’s test our intuition: Which one is safer? Which one has higher throughput? Which one is cheaper to build and maintain? Which one works better when the power goes out? The answer to all of the above is the roundabout. They reduce injury collisions by 75 percent and fatal collisions by 90 percent. They result in an 89 percent reduction in delays. They are $5,000 to $10,000 cheaper to maintain each year. And of course, they work normally during power outages. And yet which one are we more comfortable with? The signal-controlled intersection. Surprising, right? We confuse popularity with quality. (Location 140)

To disrupt this dynamic, Taylor did what came naturally—an experiment. And this one flew in the face of decades of labor relations. He actually raised wages. But there were strings attached. He offered groups of workers as much as a 15–35 percent wage premium to do a particular job, but they had to do it exactly as he instructed. Later they could go back to doing it their way at the old pay or continue with the surplus pay and his exacting standards. The question on his mind was simple: how much would it cost to get the average worker to give up their autonomy? The answer turned out to be: not that much. (Location 309)

On the heels of this newfound celebrity, Taylor published Principles of Scientific Management, which would become one of the bestselling business books of the decade. In it he offered four principles that would become the duties of a new class of managers: First. They develop a science for each element of a man’s work, which replaces the old rule-of-thumb method. Second. They scientifically select and then train, teach, and develop the workman, whereas in the past he chose his own work and trained himself as best he could. Third. They heartily cooperate with the men so as to insure all of the work being done in accordance with the principles of the science which has been developed. Fourth. There is an almost equal division of the work and the responsibility between the management and the workmen. The management take over all work for which they are better fitted than the workmen, while in the past almost all of the work and the greater part of the responsibility were thrown upon the men.

Henri Fayol, a French mining executive, published Administration Industrielle et Générale, a theory of management that would come to be known as Fayolism. It contained principles such as unity of direction, suggesting that activities with the same objective should be directed by one manager using one plan for one common goal. And the scalar chain, which proposed that authority and communications should flow in a straight line from the top to the bottom of the organization. The boxes and lines of our modern org charts are the living embodiment of his principles. (Location 336)

Henry Gantt gave us the chart that bears his name—used to this day to illustrate dependencies within complicated projects and processes. But Gantt baked in a dangerous assumption: that the world can be predicted. In Gantt’s repetitive world of manufacturing, this was tolerable, even helpful. But as his practices fanned out into knowledge work, they became a dangerous addiction. Instead of a means to an end, hitting the plan became an end unto itself. (Location 341)

And let’s not forget James McKinsey, founder of consulting juggernaut McKinsey & Company, who completely upended the accounting paradigm while everyone else obsessed over productivity. In his view, budgeting was to be an expression of policy and strategy, flowing directly from the business plan. The budget should be used to evaluate performance, to see who beat their plan and who didn’t. It would become another instrument of control. Like Taylor, McKinsey believed that great managers thought deeply about their processes and plans. He would often remark on this, in his trademark confrontational yet seductive tone. “Usually, I find that the executive who says he does not believe in an organization chart does not want to prepare one because he does not wish other people to know that he had not yet thought through his organization properly.

The thinking separated from the doing. An addiction to prediction. A chain of command. And the convergence of it all in the form of an ironclad budget. Among the theories and contributions of these industrious few we can construct much of the tapestry of modern work. It’s hard to argue their core tenets aren’t still with us. We still tell people what to do (and how to think). We still demand detailed plans before every initiative. We still focus on efficiency at the expense of effectiveness. We still use the budget as a weapon. You see, we can have all the foosball tables, fancy chairs, and free snack stations we want; we’re still living in their world. (Location 361)

London Business School professor Gary Hamel has taken up a crusade against bureaucracy by trying to put a value on our lost time and energy. After a broad workforce analysis, Hamel and his coauthor, Michele Zanini, claim that roughly half of the 23.8 million management roles in the United States are unnecessary. They found that a new wave of companies (including many featured in this book) have managed to cut their manager-to-employee ratio in half while keeping performance up. It follows that if the market could leverage the methods of these pioneers, 12.5 million managers would be free to do something more productive. (Location 375)

Beyond the waste of management, U.S. workers spend a staggering 710 million hours per week on internal compliance activities such as budgeting and planning. That’s 16 percent of our working lives. Yet, by some estimates, roughly half of all compliance activity isn’t adding value. What equates to the work of 9 million people is being wasted each year on bureaucratic theater, and this show has no intermission. (Location 380)

Combined, we’re talking about 21.5 million employees who aren’t even scratching the surface of their potential. If they were doing value-added work at an adjusted average GDP per worker of $141,000, they’d conservatively add $3 trillion to the U.S. economy. Let’s write that out and show it the respect it deserves: $3,000,000,000,000. (Location 383)

One of the most common sources of org debt is the knee-jerk reaction. Every time something goes wrong, we immediately jump to create a constraint that will prevent future mistakes. So we institute a new role, rule, or process. As a result, over the course of a decade or two, a one-step process becomes twenty steps. Or five different processes become entangled. Or ten different roles become approvers for a simple decision. And so it goes, on and on. (Location 396)

Since the publication of Taylor’s Principles in 1911, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has gone from 82.4 percent to just 9.6 percent. The number of people with a basic education has jumped to nearly nine in ten. Child mortality is one-eighth what it was. Democracy has become the dominant form of government on Earth. And the average global citizen has experienced a sixfold increase in prosperity. In so many ways we have been remarkably successful. (Location 412)

But under the surface something’s not right. We can’t quite put our finger on it, but work is harder than it used to be. Hours are long. Cycles are short. Wages are stagnant. Meaning is missing.

Among them are Richard Foster and Innosight, who have been studying corporate longevity within the S&P 500—a curated list of publicly traded companies that represents the U.S. stock market. Their research shows that in 1958, the average tenure of a company on that list was sixty-one years. But by 2016 that number had been reduced to twenty-four years. The data suggests this pattern will continue. At the current rate of churn, about half the list will be replaced in the next decade. And by 2027 the average tenure will shrink to just twelve years.

So what do they do when investors come calling? They cannibalize themselves. They cut costs in research and development. They centralize functions. They conduct layoff after layoff. They outsource anything that can be done for less outside the firm, often at the expense of quality or service. They impose strict controls, including desperate measures such as travel and hiring freezes during which none of their employees are trusted to make decisions in the company’s best interest.

There’s just one problem: mergers and acquisitions don’t work, or at least not the way we’ve been led to believe. According to one McKinsey study, almost 70 percent of mergers fail to provide the revenue synergies they promise. A similar study by KPMG found that while 82 percent of M&A participants believed their deal was a success a year after closing, only 45 percent had done a formal postdeal review to be sure. When the researchers imposed a strict objective benchmark for success, it turned out 83 percent of the deals had actually failed. (Location 451)

A recent report from the Brookings Institution showed that the share of firms aged sixteen years or older went from 23 percent in 1992 to 34 percent in 2011. That’s roughly a 50 percent increase in the space of two decades. Which would be fine, if we did our best work in large organizations. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. Among firms that pursue patents aggressively, small businesses produce sixteen times more patents than their bigger brethren. Innovation, it would seem, is somewhat scale dependent. (Location 465)

Surprisingly, labor productivity growth—the increase in the amount of goods and services produced by one hour of work—is also facing headwinds. This metric, perhaps more than any other, has always been an indicator of how fast our quality of life was improving. For much of the twentieth century it was steady. But labor productivity growth over the last decade has been crawling along at the lowest rate since the end of World War II. Occasionally now it even comes to a complete stop. In 2016 it was actually negative. This is so perplexing that economists can’t even agree on why it’s happening. With all the technological innovation of the last ten years, shouldn’t we be getting vastly more productive? It’s almost as if some other force is counteracting all those gains. (Location 469)

While labor productivity may not be growing as fast as it used to, it is certainly higher today than ever before. Between 1973 and 2016 net productivity rose by 73.7 percent. What do you think happened to wages over that same time frame? If you guessed that they were stagnant, you’re catching on. Wages were up just 12.5 percent over those same forty-three years, meaning that productivity has outpaced pay by 5.9x. Meanwhile, the ratio of pay between the CEO and the average worker went from 22.3:1 to 271:1. Move along, folks, nothing to see here. (Location 475)

It seems likely that our economy is demonstrating what systems designers call graceful degradation. It’s functional even as parts of the system are failing us. This failure isn’t catastrophic. Not yet. But there are signs that the mindsets, structures, and incentives present in our economy are faulty. In their haste to satisfy the market, organizations are becoming bigger, less efficient, and less human-centric. But the market is us. We’re doing this to ourselves.

It seems likely that our economy is demonstrating what systems designers call graceful degradation. It’s functional even as parts of the system are failing us. This failure isn’t catastrophic. Not yet. But there are signs that the mindsets, structures, and incentives present in our economy are faulty. In their haste to satisfy the market, organizations are becoming bigger, less efficient, and less human-centric. But the market is us. We’re doing this to ourselves. And in the midst of that dysfunctional feedback loop, we have an obligation to stop and ask if this is really the best we can do. (Location 479)

EVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS The antidote to the diminishing returns of the status quo is to think differently. Imagine fourteen thousand healthcare workers managed by a headquarters of fewer than fifty people. How on Earth is this possible? It’s actually quite simple. Don’t manage them. Jos de Blok was fed up with bureaucracy long before he founded Buurtzorg, a neighborhood nursing company based in the Netherlands. (Location 483)

How does this approach compare with the traditional, financially motivated model? You might assume it’s more expensive, the luxury of a quasi-socialist economy. It’s just the opposite. Buurtzorg uses less than 40 percent of doctor-prescribed hours and saves the Dutch social security system hundreds of millions of euros every year. In fact, according to Ernst & Young, delivering care in this new way resulted in a 20–30 percent reduction in per-patient costs. Not only is it financially efficient, but it’s structurally efficient as well. The firm generates more than €350 million every year, with just six financial administrators and no CFO. Since delivery of care is owned by decentralized teams, Buurtzorg has been able to avoid the seemingly inevitable bloat of bureaucratic leaders and functions for more than ten years. (Location 498)

These Evolutionary Organizations have found ways to achieve what conventional wisdom says is impossible. They make better decisions faster. They allocate resources dynamically. They form and disband teams fluidly. They innovate both product and process. They grow without losing the culture they love. They work fewer hours but get more done. They protect the planet but maintain outsized profitability. They create prosperity, not just for their shareholders but for employees, customers, and communities. These organizations have been operating in the shadows for decades. Now a growing dissatisfaction with work has pushed everyone—not just a few iconoclasts—to seek a better way of working.

At a very fundamental level, de Blok’s mental models of human motivation, how healthcare works (or doesn’t), and what success looks like are dramatically different from his contemporaries’. And that alternative worldview allows him to see possibilities others cannot. It allows his organization to do things others can only dream of. (Location 513)

When it comes to human nature, development, and motivation, they are People Positive. But they also share a deep appreciation for the dynamic and interconnected context in which we operate, a mindset I refer to as Complexity Conscious. Together these provide the scaffolding for a new way of working based on fundamentally different assumptions about people and the world we inhabit. These mental models, and the dynamic tension between them, are central to the work we need to do. So let’s take a moment to understand them better. (Location 519)

FAVI organized itself into a dozen or more “minifactories” that operate as they see fit. No time clocks. No quotas. No management.

On-time delivery isn’t a goal; it’s a social expectation. Beyond that, workers aren’t incentivized by local performance indicators that might pit them against one another. They simply get a share of the total profits of the firm. Because of this, in a good year, workers will make the equivalent of sixteen months of salary. It all adds up. (Location 536)

The minority view, the one held by FAVI, Buurtzorg, and Evolutionary Organizations everywhere, contends that we have an innate desire to fulfill our potential and self-actualize. Rooted in the work of psychologists such as Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, this view maintains that people are naturally motivated and capable of self-direction. That we are worthy of trust and respect. And importantly, that we are all chameleons, capable of suppressing or distorting our true nature depending on our environment and social context.

In 1960 McGregor published The Human Side of Enterprise, in which he introduced two theories about human behavior and motivation that he called Theory X and Theory Y. In his view, each theory was built upon a set of assumptions about human nature, that, if acted upon, would lead to very different management styles. (Location 559)

Theory X reflected the dominant assumptions of his day: The average human being has an inherent dislike of work and will avoid it if he can. Because of this human characteristic of dislike of work, most people must be coerced, controlled, directed, threatened with punishment to get them to put forth adequate effort toward the achievement of organizational objectives. The average human being prefers to be directed, wishes to avoid responsibility, has relatively little ambition, wants security above all. Considering the modern world of work, the assumptions of Theory X still feel remarkably present. Our job description tells us what to do. Our manager tells us how to do it. Our office hours tell us when to come to work. Our meeting invites tell us which conversations we can participate in. Our performance review tells us how to learn and grow. They all smack of distrust that stems from the simple belief that we’re incapable of taking responsibility for our own contribution and development. McGregor saw this belief in the “mediocrity of the masses” as inherently limiting. No matter how well intentioned, Theory X management practices, in his view, would always lead to suboptimal performance. Theory Y reflected an alternative motivation theory: The expenditure of physical and mental effort in work is as natural as play or rest. External control and the threat of punishment are not the only means for bringing about effort toward organizational objectives. Man will exercise self-direction and self-control in the service of objectives to which he is committed. Commitment to objectives is a function of the rewards [in terms of ego and self-actualization] associated with their achievement. The average human being learns, under proper conditions, not only to accept but to seek responsibility. The capacity to exercise a relatively high degree of imagination, ingenuity, and creativity in the solutions of organizational problems is widely, not narrowly, distributed in the population. Under the conditions of modern industrial life, the intellectual potentialities of the average human being are only partially utilized. (Location 561)

their groundbreaking work evolved into self-determination theory. They proposed that we have three innate psychological needs that drive and shape our behavior: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Perhaps the most important among these is autonomy—the ability to make choices and direct our own lives, free from the control of others. It’s so fundamental that Deci and Ryan have routinely referred to intrinsic motivation as “autonomous motivation.” Their theory states that we come into the world naturally curious and ready to explore. We don’t lack motivation to learn and grow; it’s built in. And this innate sense of autonomy can be enhanced or undermined. (Location 603)

one-third the turnover. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility. In 1990, on the heels of the Gulf War, orders at FAVI took a nosedive. Zobrist knew there wouldn’t be enough work to go around, and the easiest solution would be to lay off the temporary workers who made up 10 percent of the company’s workforce. But he could imagine how his workers might react. So he stood on a stack of empty pallets and addressed the entire factory. He asked what could be done that might preserve the commitments they’d made to these temporary workers and one another. After a hearty session of Q&A, an operator named Gerard piped up, “And if we stopped working for one week [per month] without being paid, could we keep temporary workers longer?” Indeed, Zobrist confirmed, that would help. He called for a show of hands. The vote was unanimous—what amounted to a 25 percent pay cut to preserve the integrity of the community until the lull in orders subsided. Shortly thereafter, it did.

Contrary to popular opinion, among people who study systems theory, “complicated” and “complex” are distinct words with precise meanings. The engine inside a car is complicated. A complicated system is a causal system—meaning it is subject to cause and effect. Although it may have many parts, they will interact with one another in highly predictable ways. Problems with complicated systems have solutions. This means that, within reason, a complicated system can be fixed with a high degree of confidence. It can be controlled. (Location 633)

Every year, four hundred full-time employees at the world’s largest tomato processor write their own job descriptions. They do this by authoring a Colleague Letter of Understanding, or CLOU, that contains their commitments to and agreements with one another. CLOUs are reviewed and challenged by colleagues who offer advice, not mandates, about what should change. Since this document changes every year, there’s no need for traditional job titles or promotions. But that’s okay, because everyone adjusts their own salary as they learn and grow. The math works out. While their industry grows around 1 percent a year, Morning Star has averaged double-digit revenue and profit growth for the past twenty years. Today it generates more than $700 million in revenue. In an industry that normally treats workers as expendable, it has managed to create a way of working that rivals any unicorn for innovative and human-centric design principles. (Location 752)

In Greg McKeown’s best-selling Essentialism, he put forth the breakthrough notion of an essential intent, a goal that sits between your ultimate vision and your quarterly objectives. He says that an essential intent “is both inspirational and concrete, both meaningful and measurable. Done right, an essential intent is one decision that settles one thousand later decisions.” (Location 823)

Questions on Purpose The following questions can be applied to the organization as a whole or the teams within it. Use them to provoke a conversation about what is present and what is possible. What is our reason for being? What will be different if we succeed? Whom do we serve? Who is our customer or user? What is meaningful about our work? What measures will help us steer? How does our purpose help us make decisions? What are we unwilling to compromise in pursuit of our goals? Can our purpose change? If so, how? What does it mean to be People Positive about purpose? Recognize that motivation is connected to a sense of purpose, meaning, and belonging. Take the time to discuss the connection between each individual’s calling and the organization’s collective purpose. What does it mean to be Complexity Conscious about purpose? Accept that purpose is recursive—it shapes us, and we shape it. Purpose enables freedom and autonomy by ensuring coherent action. And yet it’s also an emergent property of the collective.

When David Marquet took over the USS Santa Fe—a nuclear submarine and the worst-performing ship in its fleet—he vowed to never give another order, only to share his vision for the ship. Every request for orders from the sailors under his command was met with “Well, what do you intend to do?” And at first they were unsure. No one had ever asked. But in time, they came prepared. “Captain, I intend to submerge the ship.” Marquet would simply reply, “Very well.” He primed his people to think for themselves and claim the freedom and responsibility to run the ship. In the years that followed, the USS Santa Fe went from worst to first, setting the bar for retention, operations, and promotions. (Location 889)

Questions on Authority The following questions can be applied to the organization as a whole or the teams within it. Use them to provoke a conversation about what is present and what is possible. How is authority distributed? Who can tell others what to do? What kinds of decisions do we make? How do we make important decisions? How do we approach risk? What is safe to try? What is not? What decision rights do all members have? What decision rights are reserved for specific roles or teams? What does it mean to be People Positive about authority? Recognize that freedom and autonomy feed motivation. Create an environment where it is safe to try and safe to fail, and teams will learn and grow in extraordinary ways. What does it mean to be Complexity Conscious about authority? Accept that we are operating in a complex and rapidly changing world where centralized control is simply too slow and disconnected from reality. Push authority to the edge of the organization—where the information is—so teams can adapt and steer continuously. (Location 988)

Instead we can aspire for our organizations to act like dynamic networks, not unlike Hollywood. Members of a system that works this way have the freedom to organize (and reorganize) around projects and programs in order to seize opportunity and accelerate their personal growth. They can hold multiple roles in multiple places at the same time. They can maintain a more interesting set of relationships across the network—bringing to light the social structure that is present in the shadows of every organization. In place of central command and functions, we see decentralization and federalization. (Location 1032)

Thought Starters Three Structures. Author and self-proclaimed “management exorcist” Niels Pflaeging has a transformative view of the inherent physics of organizations. He claims every organization has three structures: The first is the formal structure, the realm of hierarchy, which exists purely for compliance with the law. The firm must be owned, operated, and accountable, whether it’s a corporation or a cooperative. The second is the informal structure, the realm of influence. This is the social network that exists behind the org chart, always present and often leveraged to get things done behind the scenes. And finally, the value-creation structure, the realm of reputation. This is perhaps the least well understood, because most firms confuse their formal structure with the way they create value.

Centralize vs. Decentralize. One pattern that will be very familiar to denizens of any large organization is the pendulum swing between centralization and decentralization. This plays out in cycles for almost every activity or function in the business. Take sales as an example. Decentralization creates a lot of action at the edge, but also a lot of variation and duplication. (Location 1048)

Functions vs. Integration. As we saw in the startup example above, it’s easy to end up with massive functional silos if you’re not careful. Unfortunately, centralized functions (as we currently conceive of them) are not compatible with complexity. They are too slow, too far from reality, and working under misaligned incentives. The alternative is functional integration. Create teams that have as much capability built in as possible. How is Buurtzorg able to support 14,000 nurses with such a small headquarters? Simple: the teams do a lot for themselves. Take recruiting as an example. Who better to recruit and interview a candidate than the team that person will be joining? They have infinitely more information about the skills and style they’re looking for. (Location 1058)

One to Many Roles. Here’s a fun fact: there’s no such thing as a CEO. Sure, many people run around with that title, but it’s not really one role; it’s many. The CEO is actually one part recruiter, one part spokesperson, one part board whisperer, one part fund-raiser, one part mentor, and so on. Last time I broke it down I counted something like fifteen distinct roles. The same can be said of almost any position. Job titles mask the complexity of the roles we hold, and they limit our ability to shape them and step in and out of them freely. Instead, think of the organization as a rich network of roles that can be filled and shaped by anyone. Don’t limit yourself (or anyone else) to one static job description. Recognize that you already hold many roles in many places. Claim them. (Location 1068)

In practice, this means the team is pursuing an audacious goal for the organization with the authority to make decisions and do the work unencumbered. (Location 1073)

Structure in Change Because structure is often a proxy for power, managers (particularly middle managers) may be hesitant to do anything that threatens their position. The questions they’re asking themselves are “If I’m not a VP, what am I?” and “If I distribute my power, what do I have left?” The breakthrough happens when they realize that they can trade control for participation. Rather than living in one place in the org chart, they can live in many, a mix of roles where their influence is direct rather than indirect. Positional power traded for reputation. By getting closer to the work they can find joy in it again. (Location 1084)

How would we describe our current structure? How do products, services, geographies, functions, skills, and customer segments show up in our structure? What is centralized? What is decentralized?

Within teams, how do we approach roles and accountabilities? How does our structure learn or change over time? What does it mean to be People Positive about structure? Recognize that people are capable of self-organizing if the conditions are correct. Create simple rules or agreements about how teams are formed and changed, then let people go where their skills and energy take them. What does it mean to be Complexity Conscious about structure? Organize for adaptivity. Ensure that your structure is driven by the periphery—the teams that touch the market—rather than the teams at the center. Allow teams to reorganize continuously rather than in grand gestures every few years. Clarify and specify structure when helpful, but do so in pencil. (Location 1089)

Thought Starters Wild Swings and Sure Things. His politics and cantankerous demeanor aside, Nassim Nicholas Taleb introduced an extremely valuable concept in his book The Black Swan called the barbell strategy. This financial strategy is named for how it distributes risk—to two extremes: invest 85–90 percent of your assets in extremely safe instruments, and place all of the remainder in highly speculative bets. The reasoning holds that the “sure things” will create a floor for performance, limiting your downside risk, while the “wild swings” will expose you to potentially life-changing gains.

many firms try to use OKRs as a form of top-down control, ensuring that each subordinate’s OKRs fit with the OKRs of their superior. While this feels like alignment, it all but eliminates any chance of divergence or serendipity. A healthy system is not going to cascade in a perfect hierarchy of intent. We want outliers. We want wild swings. Not a lot, but enough. And it’s easy to forget to make space for them in a system like this. (Location 1170)

The “Agile Manifesto” used “over” statements such as “responding to change over following a plan” to make trade-offs explicit in service of better software. More recently I was introduced to “even over” statements by Tom Thomison, one of the cofounders of HolacracyOne. The even over statement, which is a form of strategy, does a great job of indicating that even though we value the thing on the right, we value the thing on the left more. Amazon, for example, might use the statement “market share even over margin” to clarify that although profitability is important, at this moment the company would rather invest cash flow in further cementing its dominance in the market.

Scenario planning has the potential to open us up to possibilities that we might otherwise not consider. Done right, it’s an inexpensive way to wrestle with uncertainty. To get started, gather a group with as much diversity as you can fit in the room, and ask them to generate as many possible futures or micro scenarios as possible. Cluster them and discuss the factors involved. Discuss what could be done to mitigate or navigate these scenarios. Listen closely for anything that’s too quickly (Location 1209)

Questions on Strategy The following questions can be applied to the organization as a whole or the teams within it. Use them to provoke a conversation about what is present and what is possible. What is our current strategy? How is our strategy informed by our purpose? What are the critical factors that will mean the difference between success and failure? What are the trade-offs we’re willing to make? How do we develop, refine, and refresh our strategy? How do we communicate our strategy? How do we use strategy to filter and steer day-to-day? How does our strategy inform our planning process? What does it mean to be People Positive about strategy? Recognize that sound strategy depends on our ability to perceive what’s really going on. Each of us has a piece of that truth. Create shared consciousness through forums and tools that integrate different perspectives, and question the logic of your strategy regularly. What does it mean to be Complexity Conscious about strategy? Accept that in areas of rapid change, your strategy is only as good as your ability to learn and adjust course. Because complexity is inherently surprising, know that effective strategies may appear unlikely or counterintuitive, until they’re suddenly obvious. (Location 1229)

Most important, budgets can actually work against performance. Dr. Steve Morlidge offers a simple explanation for this in The Little Book of Beyond Budgeting. “Budgets also sub-optimize performance by forcing the business to use the same set of numbers for competing purposes. On the one hand, good targets need to include an element of stretch, but forecasts need to be realistic, while cost budgets need to be ‘tight’ in order to constrain spending. It’s simply not possible to fulfill all three purposes using the same number.” (Location 1292)

In an uncertain world, relative performance is the only true benchmark. Company to company. Team to team. And before you jump to the conclusion that relative performance might apply person to person, I’ll save you the stress.

In an interview at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, she explained, “The strength of polycentric governance systems is each of the subunits has considerable autonomy to experiment with diverse rules for a particular type of resource system and with different response capabilities to external shock.

Zero-Based Zephyr. Zero-based budgeting originated in the 1970s as a way of challenging the inertia of bloated budgets that persist year after year. The idea was to build your budget up from zero, questioning everything as you go. At Morning Star, business units present their plans for the upcoming year and colleagues invest in the ideas they like best using a virtual currency. Inspired by that practice, here’s a valuable exercise that will help you see where the wind is blowing: Bring your team or company together in a large room where you have the freedom to move around. Prior to the meeting, collaboratively generate a list of every project, program, and initiative that is currently under way, as well as any fully formed prospective projects that the group would like to see funded and executed in the next quarter. Capture them on large-format note cards or sticky notes and arrange them neatly on the wall or floor. Give each attendee one hundred virtual dollars. You can use Monopoly money, stickers, or even just pens and an honor system. Now ask everyone to invest their money as they see fit. What would they do if they were the sole decision maker for this upcoming period? When all the money is spent, have a discussion about the patterns that have emerged, and allow time for everyone to adjust their investments based on what they’ve learned. Now you face a choice: will you act on the wisdom of the crowd? (Location 1325)

This tool is just one part of a broader social trend called participatory budgeting. Twenty-two cities have adopted the practice to date, giving citizens the power to direct millions of dollars to more than 1,532 projects that matter to them. To get a sense of how it works, invite your team to try something like Cobudget and put your discretionary budget for the next quarter on the line. You’ll see a whole new level of engagement.

Questions on Resources The following questions can be applied to the organization as a whole or the teams within it. Use them to provoke a conversation about what is present and what is possible. How do we allocate funds, effort, space, and other assets? Are resources deployed annually, quarterly, or dynamically? Do we use targets, forecasts, trends, and/or tolerances? If so, how? How do strategy and planning influence resource allocation? How do we balance resources across the short term and long term? How do we balance resources across our core business and innovation? How do we define and measure the performance of our resources? How does our approach enable us to respond to emergent events? (Location 1354)

What does it mean to be People Positive about resources? Recognize that people are not resources, they are people—capable of directing their own time and attention to where they can add the most value. They’re also capable of delivering performance without fixed targets or individual incentives. Let relative targets and a share of the wealth created by the business guide behavior. What does it mean to be Complexity Conscious about resources? Accept that you cannot predict the future. Choosing how and where to spend your money a year in advance is folly. Minimize long-term commitments where appropriate to maximize discretionary funds. Ignore annual rhythms and allocate resources dynamically based on real-time information. (Location 1367)

Thought Starters Innovation Everywhere. Because of our obsession with efficiency, most organizations like to keep innovation and operations separate. They build things and they run things. But within the last decade, DevOps has emerged as a software engineering culture and practice that has completely upended that notion. As teams release software faster and more frequently, the interaction between development, quality assurance, and operations was stressed. Developers want change. Testers want risk reduction. And operators want stability. The solution was to bring these functions together into one continuous process. (Location 1397)

By studying complex adaptive systems such as ant colonies, scientists like Deborah Gordon have discovered that ants increase and decrease the randomness of their collective explorations using algorithms that balance information and risk. If a colony is released into an empty room (low/no information) they will fan out in increasingly random patterns. Introduce an apple (valuable information) and they will quickly converge upon it. Interestingly, most but not all of the ants will seize on the “sure thing” the fruit represents. Their built-in algorithms ensure that some percentage of their membership continues to look for the next big thing. (Location 1420)
