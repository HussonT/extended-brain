Tip: Make pains concrete. To clearly differentiate jobs, pains, and gains, describe them as concretely as possible. For example, when a customer says “waiting in line was a waste of time,” ask after how many minutes exactly it began to feel like wasted time. (Location 357)

The following list of trigger questions can help you think of different potential customer pains: How do your customers define too costly? Takes a lot of time, costs too much money, or requires substantial efforts? What makes your customers feel bad? What are their frustrations, annoyances, or things that give them a headache? How are current value propositions underperforming for your customers? Which features are they missing? Are there performance issues that annoy them or malfunctions they cite? What are the main difficulties and challenges your customers encounter? Do they understand how things work, have difficulties getting certain things done, or resist particular jobs for specific reasons? What negative social consequences do your customers encounter or fear? Are they afraid of a loss of face, power, trust, or status? What risks do your customers fear? Are they afraid of financial, social, or technical risks, or are they asking themselves what could go wrong? What’s keeping your customers awake at night? What are their big issues, concerns, and worries? What common mistakes do your customers make? Are they using a solution the wrong way? What barriers are keeping your customers from adopting a value proposition? Are there upfront investment costs, a steep learning curve, or other obstacles preventing adoption? (Location 365)

Seek to identify four types of customer gains in terms of outcomes and benefits: Required gains These are gains without which a solution wouldn’t work. For example, the most basic expectation that we have from a smartphone is that we can make a call with it. Expected gains These are relatively basic gains that we expect from a solution, even if it could work without them. For example, since Apple launched the iPhone, we expect phones to be well-designed and look good. Desired gains These are gains that go beyond what we expect from a solution but would love to have if we could. These are usually gains that customers would come up with if you asked them. For example, we desire smartphones to be seamlessly integrated with our other devices. Unexpected gains These are gains that go beyond customer expectations and desires. They wouldn’t even come up with them if you asked them. Before Apple brought touch screens and the App Store to the mainstream, nobody really thought of them as part of a phone. (Location 384)

As with pains, it’s better to describe gains as concretely as possible to clearly differentiate jobs, pains, and gains from one another. Ask how much they’d expect or dream of when a customer indicates “better performance” as a desired gain. That way you can note “would love an increased performance of more than x.” When you understand how exactly customers measure gains (i.e., outcomes and benefits), you can design better gain creators in your value proposition.

The following list of trigger questions can help you think of different potential customer gains: Which savings would make your customers happy? Which savings in terms of time, money, and effort would they value? What quality levels do they expect, and what would they wish for more or less of? How do current value propositions delight your customers? Which specific features do they enjoy? What performance and quality do they expect? What would make your customers’ jobs or lives easier? Could there be a flatter learning curve, more services, or lower costs of ownership? What positive social consequences do your customers desire? What makes them look good? What increases their power or their status? What are customers looking for most? Are they searching for good design, guarantees, specific or more features? What do customers dream about? What do they aspire to achieve, or what would be a big relief to them? How do your customers measure success and failure? How do they gauge performance or cost? What would increase your customers’ likelihood of adopting a value proposition? Do they desire lower cost, less investment, lower risk, or better quality? (Location 402)

Here’s a better way to do it: Find out precisely how much more money the customer expects to earn so it feels like a gain and investigate what decrease would feel like a pain. In the pains, add the barriers that prevent or make it difficult to get a job done. In our example the pain might be “my employer doesn’t give raises.” In the pains, add the risks related to not getting the job done. In our example the pain could be “might not be able to afford my child’s future college tuition.” (Location 515)

Your list of products and services may also include supporting ones that help your customers perform the roles of buyer (those that help customers compare offers, decide, and buy), co-creator (those that help customers co-design value propositions), and transferrer (those that help customers dispose of a product).

Great value propositions focus on pains that matter to customers, in particular extreme pains. You don’t need to come up with a pain reliever for every pain you’ve identified in the customer profile–no value proposition can do this. (Location 566)

The following list of trigger questions can help you think of different ways your products and services may help your customers alleviate pains. Ask yourself: Could your products and services . . . produce savings? In terms of time, money, or efforts. make your customers feel better? By killing frustrations, annoyances, and other things that give customers a headache. fix underperforming solutions? By introducing new features, better performance, or enhanced quality. put an end to difficulties and challenges your customers encounter? By making things easier or eliminating obstacles. wipe out negative social consequences your customers encounter or fear? In terms of loss of face or lost power, trust, or status. eliminate risks your customers fear? In terms of financial, social, technical risks, or things that could potentially go wrong. help your customers better sleep at night? By addressing significant issues, diminishing concerns, or eliminating worries. limit or eradicate common mistakes customers make? By helping them use a solution the right way. eliminate barriers that are keeping your customer from adopting value propositions? Introducing lower or no upfront investment costs, a flatter learning curve, or eliminating other obstacles preventing adoption. (Location 569)

Relevance A pain reliever can be more or less valuable to the customer. Make sure you differentiate between essential pain relievers and ones that are nice to have. The former relieve extreme issues, often in a radical way, and create a lot of value. The latter merely relieve moderate pains. (Location 581)

Gain Creators Gain creators describe how your products and services create customer gains. They explicitly outline how you intend to produce outcomes and benefits that your customer expects, desires, or would be surprised by, including functional utility, social gains, positive emotions, and cost savings.

The following list of trigger questions can help you think of different ways your products and services may help your customers obtain required, expected, desired, or unexpected outcomes and benefits. Ask yourself: Could your products and services . . . create savings that please your customers? In terms of time, money, and effort. produce outcomes your customers expect or that exceed their expectations? By offering quality levels, more of something, or less of something. outperform current value propositions and delight your customers? Regarding specific features, performance, or quality. make your customers’ work or life easier? Via better usability, accessibility, more services, or lower cost of ownership. create positive social consequences? By making them look good or producing an increase in power or status. do something specific that customers are looking for? In terms of good design, guarantees, or specific or more features. fulfill a desire customers dream about? By helping them achieve their aspirations or getting relief from a hardship? produce positive outcomes matching your customers’ success and failure criteria? In terms of better performance or lower cost. help make adoption easier? Through lower cost, fewer investments, lower risk, better quality, improved performance, or better design. (Location 595)

Relevance A gain creator can produce more or less relevant outcomes and benefits for the customer just like we have seen for pain relievers. Make sure you differentiate between essential and nice to have gain creators. (Location 608)
