When it comes to estimating costs, be realistic about the resources and external help you will need to achieve your milestones. Milestones should align with easy-to-approve funding amounts. ([Location 6002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6002))

If your ExO Core Initiative is heavily dependent on an emerging technology, your milestones may reflect the interim steps that will prepare your organization to adopt the technology as it matures. ([Location 6007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6007))

TASK 3 Build a final presentation for the ExO Core Initiatives DESCRIPTION To prepare for next week's final presentations, you'll need to develop a deck for each of your ExO Core Initiatives. For this round, instead of using the short elevator pitch format, you will produce longer, more comprehensive presentations for each of the ExO initiatives. Follow the outline in the templates found later in this section. ([Location 6015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6015))

Craft a story that makes a compelling case for the initiative, beginning with the problem space and including a clear definition of the initiative's value proposition. Is the concept easy to understand? Is its value obvious? ([Location 6036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6036))

Disruption/Reaction It's also important to explain the external disruption, which is the main driver of the ExO Core Initiative. If the disruption comes from an ExO Edge Initiative, don't forget to mention that. ([Location 6059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6059))

Once the external disruption is made clear, introduce the internal reaction that will either enable you to avoid the threat coming from external disruption or leverage the opportunities that threat can bring. ([Location 6061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6061))

When communicating new ideas, it's helpful to use storytelling techniques. One option is to invent a story and illustrate it with pictures and diagrams that explain the problem and how your solution solves it. We recommend using case studies if you are presenting six or fewer initiatives. Count on five minutes to present each initiative. ([Location 6065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6065))

Business Model It's a good idea to show how your ExO Core Initiative fits within your organization's current business model. You'll want to illustrate how you are improving and adapting your business model to external industry disruption (as opposed to changing it).

ExO Attributes Since you are both adapting the organization to external industry disruption and connecting it to external abundance, it is important to illustrate how you plan to reach that abundance (using the SCALE attributes) and how you will manage it (using the IDEAS attributes). Present the ExO Canvas and explain how the ExO attributes apply to the ExO Core Initiative. ([Location 6076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6076))

After the presentations are over, the leadership team and selected advisors will convene to make a decision about which ExO Core Initiatives will move forward and how much funding to allocate to each. Initiatives must be evaluated from the point of view of how the ExO Core Initiatives will make the organization more adaptable to external industry disruption by avoiding threats and/or leveraging opportunities. In addition, the leadership team must also be careful not to take on the role of the corporate immune system.

your team has gone through a personal transformation process. As a result, they have: Learned new methods of working together across organizational boundaries. Acted as entrepreneurs. Experienced the productivity that real-time virtual collaboration and communication offers. Become “comfortable being uncomfortable” in presenting ideas to the leadership team in a far less polished form than they have likely been accustomed to (the leadership team has also experienced the value of this format. Been “forced” into a lean mindset by the pace and intensity of the weekly assignments. Seen the value of the fast iteration of ideas based on early feedback. Witnessed the disruption process in action. Come to understand that learning lies in “failure.” Gained experience across a range of business innovation models and practices—including the ExO model—which they can now carry into their daily work.

If you are a leading organization aiming to both reinvent an industry and transform your organization for an external industry disruption, the outcome of the ExO Sprint has been a set of ExO Edge Initiatives and a set of ExO Core Initiatives. While the ExO Edge Initiatives should result in next-generation organizations structured to lead your industry (and perhaps even others), the ExO Core Initiatives will help your organization adapt to external industry disruption—including the disruption posed by the new ExO Edge Initiatives.

If you are an established organization wanting to adapt to external industry disruption, the outcome of the ExO Sprint has been a set of ExO Core Initiatives. By successfully implementing these ExO Core Initiatives, your organization has the ability to remain relevant in a rapidly changing world for many years to come.

If you are an entrepreneur or company builder wanting to develop one or more Exponential Organizations in order to transform a specific industry, the outcome of the ExO Sprint has been one or more ExO Edge Initiatives. Developing these ExO Edge Initiatives offers the opportunity to both accomplish your goals and become the Next Big Thing in your industry. The circle diagram provides a template that can be used to position a resulting set of ExO initiatives to summarize the ExO Sprint outcome.

It represents a new ecosystem in which your organization has adapted not only to industry disruption but also to the ExO Edge Initiatives created.

Tags: #apply/experiment #insight/action #insight/key-point
Environment You need to find the right environment or elements (innovation ecosystem) to take an ExO Edge Initiative to the next step. Company builders and business incubators can help with this. You also need access to key collaborators—entrepreneurs, investors, and partners. ([Location 6289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6289))

Team Chose a CEO and gather a team. It's a good idea to source your CEO from an external innovation ecosystem, since most of the people working within an established organization are focused on execution-based methodologies rather than search-based ones. Also remember to allocate vesting equity to the founding team. ([Location 6294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6294))

Resources Assign resources to the ExO Edge Initiative linked to key milestones. Update the allocation of those resources after achieving milestones and applying important learnings. Looking for external funding for a second investment round is also a good idea, since in addition to providing money, external investors can validate your ExO. ([Location 6298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6298))

Support Make sure the ExO initiative has the full support of the company's leadership team before you get started. Each ExO team must be free to operate without interference, with the CEO of any new organization making all decisions. This is essential to prevent the corporate immune system from attacking the new company. ([Location 6303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6303))

INTER protección Mexico City 10 weeks 36 participants INTERprotección is a Mexican group of companies specializing in insurance brokerage, reinsurance, and surety of the highest quality. As an insurance broker, INTERprotección negotiates the best possible terms and conditions with insurers, providing cost-effective solutions to clients. With over 5,000 institutional clients in Latin America, the company has a global presence and is widely recognized. Prior to running the ExO Sprint, INTERprotección was aware of industry disruption happening not only in insurance but also across other industries. As a result of that awareness, it chose to become a disrupter rather than allow itself to be disrupted. The company also realized that new technologies and business models would enable it to reach exponential growth beyond its current market by, for example, launching new B2C disruptive business models.

Preparation The company's ExO Sprint goal was to transform the organization, the industry, and related industries, so all ExO initiatives were focused on the insurance industry and adjacent industries. INTERprotección's ExO Sprint was one of the first ever executed, so the approach in terms of the number and type of ExO teams differed from what we recommend today. In fact, the ExO Sprint presented in this book is the result of lessons learned—and improvements made—after executing several ExO Sprints with early adopters such as INTERprotección.

Execution INTERprotección's ExO Sprint began in March 2016 and ran for a total of 11 weeks (one week for the Awake Session and Align Session at the outset, plus 10 weeks for the ExO Sprint weekly assignments). The project was led by INTERproteccion CEO Paqui Casanueva, who also played a role as an ExO Sprint participant. His participation was a powerful motivator to his team and helped drive a mindset change. ([Location 6389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6389))

The main challenge was managing and coordinating six ExO teams, which turned out to be too many. A particular issue was that the schedule for the ExO Disruption Session and later Launch Session was tight; there was little time for each team to present its ExO initiatives. Nonetheless, the ExO teams managed to deliver a great outcome. INTERprotección was a true early adopter of the ExO Sprint methodology, and the learnings there significantly contributed to the improvement of the ExO Sprint process for future projects.

Outcomes The ExO Sprint resulted in six ExO initiatives (two ExO Core Initiatives and four ExO Edge Initiatives), as well as an innovation lab that was designed during the course of the ExO Sprint. All ExO initiatives presented were selected for further development and received a total of $2.5 million in funding.

Overall, INTERproteccion learned how to transform the organization by keeping incremental innovation within the organization and allocating disruptive innovation outside the main organization. The company also learned that not only is it important to generate a lot of ExO Initiatives (content) but also to either design an innovation lab (a container) or find an external company builder to further develop the ExO initiatives once the ExO Sprint is completed.

INTERproteccion also figured out what the insurance industry will look like as a result of the disruption currently underway and launched ExO initiatives that will allow it to keep (and solidify) its leadership position. In short, INTERproteccion adopted a “learn-by-doing” approach to transformation.

To this purpose, we took the ExO framework as a reference and went a step further to engage ExO Works to propel our transformation. Our primary goal was to shift from operating as a conventional utility to a digitized, innovation-driven one. The scope involved any and all aspects of the business, including energy, utilities, finance, service, and government. We were eager to test the ExO Sprint methodology in-house. DEWA was being encouraged by the Dubai government to try out new approaches to spark innovation, and a methodology like the ExO… ([Location 6460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6460))

We had wanted to expedite the pre-Sprint process and jump in prior to engagement of the full leadership team and final selection of participant teams. We learned, however, that this preparation is critical for the success of the Sprint. When we next do another engagement of this type, we will also choose a time of the year where most of the employees who need to be engaged in the ExO Sprint will have fewer competing demands on their time.

Outcomes The ExO Sprint was a unique opportunity for our different divisions to collaborate closely on a common purpose and experience the richness that this brings. It also helped to uncover untapped talent within the organization and open up opportunities for experimentation. The teams developed seven initiatives that together represented a new business ecosystem for the company. The projects were developed based on transformative business models combined with exponential technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, water out of air, and energy storage. We achieved amazing results on multiple levels: Strategic: DEWA was the first organization in the region to learn the ExO methodology. We became an early adopter and received a boost in the right direction of innovation. Cultural: The ExO Sprint introduced effective collaboration, helped in overcoming cultural barriers, and offered a new approach to developing ideas and solutions. Personal: The ExO Sprint introduced our employees to new resources (internal and external), and participants gained a new understanding of where and how they could implement emerging technologies. Ideas: Some of the ExO Sprint initiatives were taken on by our R&D department, including the initiative to transform air into water; others were presented to the Dubai 10X program for disruptive innovation launched by the Government of Dubai.

Follow-Up DEWA continues to work with concepts similar to the ones developed during the ExO Sprint through the investments in startups it carries out as part of the Dubai Government Accelerators' program and its comprehensive Research and Development Program. Our employees gained a heightened awareness of innovative resources and technology, and the culture became collaborative—clear evidence of a shift in mindset. A goal for the organization was to test a completely new approach for creating value along with a new velocity for decision-making. In the end, not only did we achieve this, but we also experienced significant positive benefits such as increased team collaboration and instituting experimentation and agile exploration of new technologies and trends into all facets of our work.

Preparation Over the past couple of years, Stanley Black & Decker has initiated efforts to double revenues in the next half-decade through organic growth and acquisitions. To achieve this growth, the company must be open to new business models, adopt new technologies, and pursue new businesses with high opportunities for growth. With the ExO Sprint we saw a unique opportunity to experience how to ideate, test, and, importantly, launch initiatives with exponential potential. We wanted to generate a deep transformation of our organization quickly. We chose to run four ExO Sprints, each in a different business unit, to achieve company-wide impact. Concurrently, we selected existing internal projects to accelerate with ExO Incubation Partners and established an internal incubation unit, our Exponential Learning Unit (ELU), to orchestrate the work of generating new exponential businesses. Our first ExO Sprint was focused on our Security business unit, which is in an industry seeing rapid commoditization of services. Our objectives were to address external disruptions and create new, fast-growing businesses. ([Location 6531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6531))

It was a challenge to unlearn some of our organizational practices—how we typically do things—in order to learn new alternatives. For example, this was evident when the teams had to validate their hypotheses. There was a natural tendency to want to engage third parties to do this, rather than “getting out of the building” to do it ourselves. The Sprint was valuable in bringing more agile ways of working to life. One of the greatest challenges for participants was having the availability to commit the required time to the ExO Sprint. Learning to juggle day-to-day business responsibilities while creating new structural value for the organization was a bumpy road, but we recognized it as a crucial exercise required by any organization that wants to remain relevant in this era of disruption.

Outcomes Outstanding results were achieved over the course of the ExO Sprint. Many of the teams came to the final presentation with demos. Seven of the eight initiatives presented at the final session were funded on the spot and approved for next steps. The ExO Sprint created the opportunity to tap into new markets, solve some of our current challenges, and discover new technologies and applications. Furthermore, it catalyzed a profound mindset shift not only for participants, but also for outside employees who were attracted by the process and amazed by the results. Along the way, we learned that: We have significant in-house talent. Without the opportunity to commit time to create structural value for the company in an orchestrated way through an agile process, this talent would have remained untapped or beyond reach. The process of creation may initially seem overwhelming but by gaining confidence through persistence and practice, it becomes an empowering experience. Opportunities to create value are ubiquitous.

From the ExO Sprint, we gained the benefit of being able to identify, structure, and rapidly validate exponential opportunities for growth and adaptability. We instilled a profound mindset shift from a single-speed operating model focused only on meeting quarterly goals, to a dual-speed operating model focused simultaneously on meeting quarterly goals while creating value by leveraging the abundance of a hyper-connected and tech-powered world. We are now underway with our next two ExO Sprints for other business divisions. ([Location 6583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6583))

HP Large Format Printing Barcelona, Spain 10 weeks 28 participants The ExO Sprint for the Large Format Design Printing Business of HP Inc. took place in Barcelona, Spain, over the course of 10 weeks. The Awake session was held September 7, 2017, and the final presentations were delivered December 14, 2017. The Large Format Design Printing Business of HP is the indisputable leader in the Large Format (LF) industry, far ahead of our closest competitor. HP has been the leader in Lf Design for more than 25 years! We service a broad universe of customers: technical design (architects, designers, construction, utilities, engineers); production (repro houses, copy shops, CRDs); indoor and outdoor graphics production; and graphic design and professional photo. HP is constantly innovating to reinvent itself and create new businesses such as 3D and Latex. ([Location 6595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6595))

Preparation Our ExO Sprint lasted 10 weeks, with a one-week break before Week 1 and a two-week break prior to its completion. The goal was to build on the success of the LF Design business in a way that nobody would expect by adopting a new methodology for innovation that harnesses the power of exponential technologies, provides new vectors of discovery and growth, and accelerates our capacity to always be innovating. The scope of work was defined to focus on the Large Format Design segment with two main intents: Transform the LF printing industry and make the current organization more flexible and adaptive. We recognized that many industries could be transformed by applying the core competences of the LF Design division, such as pharma, cosmetics, printing, communications, and construction. HP decided to start with Large Format Design Printing because our Project Sponsor was recognized as a visionary within the company when it comes to innovation and the application of new methodologies.

Execution We made four customizations to the standard ExO Sprint: Edge teams were open to the possibility of disrupting other industries by building on the existing core competencies of the current business. We created an “uncontaminated” team (i.e., participants with less than six months with the company) made up of Millennials. We brought external ExO Advisors to the closing session. We conducted an extra feedback loop during Week 9, allowing teams to really adopt the Experimentation attribute as a fundamental change to the way they usually work.

As could be expected, challenges during our ExO Sprint were mainly related to having participants get used to changing their usual ways of working, keeping up with the weekly deliverable schedule and bringing in new, external perspectives. We found that the “soft skills” of coaching (empathy, encouragement, reframing, etc.) were valuable in supporting participants through their new experiences. We also grappled with low bandwidth, which we addressed by bringing additional participants to the teams.

On the organizational front, the following transformations took place: Cultural shift to becoming more agile in execution; we moved away from the idea of perfection in favor of going FAST. Cultural shift toward customer insights; we initiated a culture of experimentation (customer development, fast prototyping). Opened our business to the outside. For example, external ExO Advisors were engaged to do periodic (once or twice monthly) checks on the progress of the projects. Incorporation of the word “disruption” in strategic conversations where it had been formerly taboo. Developed deep knowledge of disruptive technologies and ExO attributes. Created new opportunities and ideas to explore; ExO ideas were integrated into our current innovation processes.

Grupo Cuerva Granada, Spain 10 weeks 24 participants Our ExO Sprint took place in Granada, Spain, over the course of 10 weeks beginning in October 2017. Grupo Cuerva has been active in the electricity sector for over 75 years and oversees the generation, distribution, and sale of electric power. It is also involved in the establishment and maintenance of electricity installations. In addition, the company features a disruptive innovation “Lab on the Edge” called Turning Tables. It was launched a couple of years ago with a vision of incubating next-generation businesses for the energy industry. Grupo Cuerva employs approximately 80 people, and some 30 percent of the company—representing all areas of the organization—was involved in the ExO Sprint.

Preparation The energy industry is being exposed to many changes that will ultimately transform it completely—so much so that we're assuming that electricity will be free in a decade! Given this tectonic shift in the industry, our main goal was to transform our company into an innovation-centric organization. Our intent was to transform not only the industry but the company as well. To that end, the Edge Stream was designed to work on any sector whether or not it was in an adjacent market.

Execution The project was led by our CEO, Ignacio Cuerva, who provided us with a draft of this book and which we used as a guide with great success. Our ExO Sprint was structured into four teams, two Core and two Edge, each comprised of five people. Paqui Rubio was the ExO Coach for both Core teams as well as a team member on one of the Edge teams. Alfredo Rivela (CEO of Turning Tables) acted as the ExO Coach for both Edge teams, and Francisco Palao, co-author of this book, acted as Head Coach in support of both ExO Coaches whenever they had any questions about the methodology.

Outcomes Ten initiatives were presented at the Launch Session: five from the Core teams and five from the Edge teams. Eight initiatives were selected by Cuerva's leadership team and received funding for their next stages. The ExO Core Initiatives are being coordinated internally by the Innovation Department, and Turning Tables, Grupo Cuerva's innovation lab, is developing the ExO Edge Initiatives. While it's too early to report on results of the recently launched initiatives, it's clear that the mindset of the organization as a whole has completely shifted, and that those who participated in the ExO Sprint feel empowered to try new things in their goal of leading the way to industry transformation.

Our ExO Core Initiatives are predominantly focused on digital transformation and include designing new roles (e.g., a data scientist) and making the company more adaptable to clean energy disruption. The biggest challenge of the ExO Sprint was the level of dedication required and ensuring that executive management was at all times aware that employees needed to dedicate over 50% of their time to the project. However, strong support from the CEO of the company and a high level of passion among the participants working on the ExO Sprint made the whole project a great experience for everyone, especially given the outstanding results.

With a third of our employees engaged in the project, the ExO Sprint was a massive commitment, one that translated into a tremendous shift in terms of our company's culture and in defining what is possible. Many of our staff have now come to adopt a transformational mindset, and our new “normal” involves creating and testing new hypotheses on a daily basis.

What you won't achieve with an ExO Workshop Behavioral changes. The ExO Sprint takes place over a 10-week period and results in a new mindset. You won't see the same shifts in behavior with an ExO Workshop, but it will excite participants and provide and understanding of why the ExO approach works. ExO initiatives ready to be implemented. While an ExO Workshop often results in great ideas, it won't prepare the organization to implement them. (Even if the organization were to try, it would fail, creating frustration and discontent.) In fact, ideas are not even the most important ingredient of the transformation process. More important, at least initially, is understanding how to block the corporate immune system response—which kicks into gear at the first sign of change—and preparing the organization for the internal process of transformation should the company leadership decide to take the next step and conduct an ExO Sprint. Who should attend Leadership Team: Since the primary goal of the ExO Workshop is to create awareness within an organization about the need for transformation and how the ExO framework can help, it's imperative for the leadership team to be in the room. The CEO and other executive team members (including the CIO, CTO, and even CFO) serve as the first line of defense against the corporate immune system.… ([Location 6755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6755))

Preparation Choose participants for an ExO Workshop carefully. It's a good idea to have the CEO and as many leadership team members in the room as possible (from one company or all of them, depending on the workshop makeup), since they will be the ones to follow up with an ExO Sprint after the workshop, and thus enable transformation. Including middle management from throughout the organization is also advised. Participants are grouped into teams. The number of teams affects the dynamics of the workshop, since all teams will present their results after each exercise. We recommend four to six teams, each comprised of four to eight people. (The total number of participants should range from 16 to 48 people.) To create a… ([Location 6804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6804))

Good Practices Choose a different company than your own as a case study for the ExO Workshop. Using your own organization as a case study encourages participants to believe that the ExO initiatives they come up with during the exercises are ready to be implemented. (They won't be.) Look for a B2C business model when picking a case study. Consumer-oriented businesses are well known and thus easier to understand when it comes to applying the ExO framework. It's also a good idea to select a company that everyone can easily relate to, such as a retailer, airline, car company, or bank. Encourage experimentation and learning. The ExO Workshop allows participants to experiment with the ExO framework, which offers a learn-by-doing… ([Location 6823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6823))

ExO Sprint Sponsor The ExO Sprint Sponsor should hold the highest-level position possible: CEO, general manager, or, at minimum, VP of the business line where the ExO Sprint will be conducted. The ExO Sprint Sponsor should be excited about the ExO Sprint and convinced of its value. He or she should also be prepared to allocate sufficient time to follow its progress, including spending quality time listening to and supporting each group. Set goals and expectations with the ExO Head Coach and communicate those goals and expectations to the ExO Sprint participants. Bear in mind that the ExO Sprint may frustrate and overwhelm ExO Sprint participants, especially during its first half. This is normal; they will be working in a different way and will need time to adapt. Take the time to find the right ExO Sprint participants and ensure they are able to allocate sufficient time to the initiative. Create one team made up of younger people who have limited experience of the company and the industry. They will bring a fresh perspective to the ExO initiatives ideation and development process. Participate directly in the ExO Sprint as an ExO Sprint participant. CEOs who have done this describe an amazing learning and team-building experience. Participation will also enable you to maximize the outcome of the ExO Sprint. Communicate to ExO Sprint participants that there are no losers or winners, and that it is most important to follow the process and do their best. This understanding will help them avoid frustration if, for example, their initiatives are eliminated following the ExO Disruption Session. Pick the right team to conduct the ExO Sprint.

ExO Sprint Participant Be conscious that a lot of things are happening outside your company, many of them related to your business. Explore these developments and take advantage of them! Keep an open mind from the outset. It doesn't matter if the first ideas or experiments turn out to be completely crazy; by the end of the process, you'll have something great. Do not get attached to any one idea and be open to changing it. Remember that the best ideas come from iteration. No ego allowed! Get comfortable with the uncomfortable. Trust the process. Part of that process is learning how to use new management and innovation methodologies, so being unclear on how to do things is normal (especially during the first half of the ExO Sprint). Learning is an important part of your ExO Sprint path. Put the time in, as you will only get out of the ExO Sprint what you put into it. Assign at least two hours per day to meet with your team and work individually on the assignments. Set daily milestones and weekly priorities and tasks. Take advantage of the opportunity to work with people from other departments who bring different experiences. Building these connections and learning from them will only be a positive in your personal and professional development. Seek out those who can help with even small contributions (mockups, prototypes, surveys, etc.). Such assistance can make a difference in the success of your projects. Brainstorm with ExO practitioners and exponential… ([Location 6857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6857))

ExO Coach Check in to make sure your team isn't developing ExO initiatives that are clearly not in the interest of the company. Direct them as needed, following the scope communicated by the ExO Head Coach. Avoid guiding your team from a content point of view (e.g., by suggesting or evaluating ideas). Instead, guide it from a process point of view, driving members to complete assignments and run proper experiments to evaluate ideas. Connect the dots. Every week builds on the previous one. Make sure your team is building on what came before and incorporating already created materials. Keep your team in an exponential-thinking mindset. Push your team to experiment by having them operate in “search mode”; discourage them from operating in “execution mode.” Check in weekly to see what they have learned, both from an ExO initiatives point of view and a personal point of view. Never deliver anything on behalf of your team. Your job is to guide them, not do the tasks for them. Ask your team for feedback so you can improve the way you coach and guide them. Always be available! Never disappear on your team. More… ([Location 6888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07S46YDG4&location=6888))

Learn about the company and its goals for the ExO Sprint prior to the Disruption Session, which will better enable you to provide context-based feedback. Educate yourself about other startups and disruptions in the industry before attending the Disruption Session. Such research will increase your ability to offer helpful insight. Write down all feedback for each ExO initiative presented by each team and share the key points verbally following the presentations. You can also send a more complete assessment after the Disruption Session and/or Launch Session. Start with positive feedback about the good things the teams have done to shape their initiatives. Follow up with honest and straightforward feedback on what they can do to improve. Provide process-oriented feedback and guidance, following the ExO framework—e.g., help them identify which initiatives are ExO Core Initiatives and which are ExO Edge Initiatives, as well as the implications of those designations. Provide content-oriented feedback and input based on your knowledge and experience as a specialist in a specific field. And remember, if you provide content-oriented input, you must make it clear that it's just a personal opinion, another hypothesis to be tested. Encourage teams to think using an exponential mindset. For ExO Edge Initiatives, evaluate whether they are “proper” ExO Edge Initiatives and whether they qualify as disruptive and scalable.
