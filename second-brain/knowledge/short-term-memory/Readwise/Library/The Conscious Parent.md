When you parent, it’s crucial you realize you aren’t raising a “mini me,” but a spirit throbbing with its own signature. For this reason, it’s important to separate who you are from who each of your children is. Children aren’t ours to possess or own in any way. When we know this in the depths of our soul, we tailor our raising of them to their needs, rather than molding them to fit our needs.

If you want to enter into a state of pure connection with your child, you can achieve this by setting aside any sense of superiority. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M40QEJ0&location=281))

Once we have detached from our expectations of how another person “should” behave and we encounter them as they really are, the acceptance we inevitably demonstrate toward them naturally induces connection. This is because authenticity automatically resonates with authenticity. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M40QEJ0&location=296))

our children contribute to our growth in ways that are perhaps more profound than we can ever contribute to theirs. Although a child appears in a “lesser than” form, susceptible to the whims and dictates of a more powerful parent, it’s precisely the child’s seemingly less-powerful status that has the potential to call forth the greatest transformation in a parent.

This task is to raise yourself into the most awakened and present individual you can be.

Our children come to us so we may recognize our psychic wounds and call up the courage to transcend the limitations these wounds place on us. As we ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M40QEJ0&location=399))

If you understand that the inappropriate behavior of your children is a call to increased consciousness on your part, you are able to view the opportunities they afford you to grow differently. Instead of reacting to them, you look within yourself and ask why you react. In the asking, you open a space for consciousness to arise.
