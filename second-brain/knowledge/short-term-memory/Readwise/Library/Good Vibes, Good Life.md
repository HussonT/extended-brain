It’s important to recognize that it’s not unjust to let go of those who show no concern for you. (Location 156)

Self-love is the balance between accepting yourself as you are while knowing you deserve better, and then working towards it. (Location 162)

In fact, self-love consists of two essential elements that must be balanced if one wishes to live a harmonious life. The first element encourages unconditional love towards yourself. The focus is on mindset. The truth is, you won’t love yourself more if, for example, you lose or gain weight, or undergo cosmetic surgery. You may feel more confident, sure. But true self-love is when you appreciate where you are and who you are, regardless of any transformation you aspire to. The second element encourages growth, and the focus is on taking action. Improving yourself and your life is also self-love because it means you recognize that you deserve more than settling for mediocrity. (Location 166)

True self-love can be present in anything that adds value to your life, from your diet to your spiritual rituals or the way you interact within your personal relationships. And, of course, a significant aspect of self-love is acceptance: being content with who you are, as you are. As a result, self-love is empowerment and liberation. (Location 177)

An understanding of self-love allows us to find balance between mindset and action. Without balance we’ll regularly stumble, fall and feel lost. When you love yourself, life will begin to love you back. (Location 179)

Once you’re in vibrational resonance with something, you begin to attract it into your reality. The best way to identify what frequency you’re on is through your emotions – your emotions show a true reflection of your energy. Sometimes we can believe we’re in a positive state of mind or taking good actions, but deep down we know we’re not; we’re just pretending. (Location 319)

Ideally, we want to feel as loving and joyful as we can in life. These are the highest-vibrating feelings, and will help us manifest more of what we want – and, by extension, more good vibrations. In contrast, feelings of hatred, anger and despair have a very low vibration. They’ll attract more of what we don’t want. (Location 336)

So, if you send out feelings of joy, then you’ll be given more things to feel joyful about. The common misconception is that you’ll feel good only once you have what you want. The truth is that you can feel good right now. (Location 341)

Ultimately, self-love and raising the level of your vibration go hand in hand. When you make an effort to raise your vibration, you show yourself the love and care you deserve. You’ll feel good and attract good. By taking positive actions and changing your mindset, you’ll manifest greater things. By loving yourself, you’ll live a life you love. (Location 346)

The Law of Vibration suggests that we attract people who are vibrating on the same frequency as us. So, if we can begin to experience more positive emotions on a regular basis as a result of other people, we’ll attract even more positive people into our life, thus reinforcing the good vibes around us.

How to transform negative emotions Identify: to change your emotional state, you must identify what emotion you’re feeling. In Sarah’s example, she felt sad and afraid. After delving deeper, we identified that Sarah also felt neglected and insecure. Challenge: the next step would be to question yourself: Why do you feel the way you do? What thoughts are responsible for this? (Location 607)

It’s important to realize that we create our own sadness by attaching negative conclusions to these past experiences in our subconscious mind. Here we must challenge these conclusions, which are stored as lessons. Failing to correct the negative lessons means they’re replayed in your subconscious mind. Over time, these lessons on repeat can weigh you down and induce depression. (Location 625)

Understand: This step is all about appreciating the deeper meaning behind the emotion. In our example, Sarah found that she was feeling insecure as a result of her recent experience. She started to worry that she wasn’t good enough. During the days when her love interest was texting back, she felt better about herself. It was clear that she had a high need for social acceptance and approval. (Location 628)

If, as happens very often, we don’t treat ourselves with the kindness and respect we deserve, we become insecure, and this affects our confidence, attitude and health. This results in a struggle to show love towards others in the way we want to, which, in turn, affects the expressions of love we receive. People tend to enjoy being around, and fall in love with, those who gracefully accept themselves. For this reason, self-love is a vital element in building strong relationships. (Location 1165)

Affirmations should be in your own words. Say them in your voice, as if you’re telling facts to a friend. Only repeat positive statements – don’t recite what you don’t want. What we resist often persists, because the energy we exude in avoiding it is also returned to us. So, for example, you might say, ‘I have great confidence in everything I do,’ rather than, ‘I am not nervous anymore.’ And affirmations should be spoken in the present tense. (Location 1577)

Be honest Write them down exactly as you wish them. Don’t restrict yourself or write them in a way that you think is ‘right’. If you have big goals, that’s fine. Thinking big means you’re open to receiving big. Write them in the present tense Just as with affirmations, write down your goals in the present tense, as if you’ve already accomplished them, such as ‘I am a great mathematician’ (if that’s what you want to become). Your subconscious mind will choose the path of least resistance in order to manifest your goals. Make them positive Remember, always write your goals down from a positive stance: focus on what you want, not what you don’t want. Write them in your own voice Write them exactly how you’d say them. You don’t need to use fancy language. These goals are to be understood by you and you alone. Write them in a way that you connect with easily; you shouldn’t have to try to translate them in your head. (Location 1633)

You don’t need it all figured out. The more you think you do, the more you’ll procrastinate and fear moving forward. Have courage and start now, even if you start small. Just go for it! (Location 1841)

If you still struggle to beat procrastination, try the following techniques: Get rid of every distraction possible, even if this means changing your environment. Have you ever been hungry and ended up snacking on something unhealthy just because it was there? If it wasn’t there, the temptation wouldn’t exist. We get distracted by things that are easily available to us. Give yourself an incentive to complete the task. For example, tell yourself you can meet with your friends later if you finish whatever needs to be done. This will give you something to look forward to and motivate you to take action. Take breaks to do something enjoyable. We all need a little time out when working, but make sure your breaks are for a fixed duration. If you want to watch a new episode of a show, schedule a period for it and don’t exceed it. Get creative. Make your tasks more appealing. When doing activities that don’t require much thought, you could play music in the background. This will raise your vibration. Singing along might make the activity even more enjoyable. Get some help if required. Never be afraid to ask for help. Talk to someone who’s recently accomplished a similar goal to you. This may provide much-needed inspiration and they may be able to give you valuable guidance. Give yourself a consequence for not taking action. For example, you could tell yourself that if you don’t go to the gym today, you can’t watch television for the entire week. To ensure you don’t go back on what you say, make sure you tell others about it. This leads me to my final point… Announce your intentions to some trustworthy friends. This will give you some accountability; they’ll know if you don’t stick to your plans, and they might even give you a little push to ensure that you achieve what you set out to do. (Location 1857)

Your higher purpose You came here loaded with potential, ability, gifts, wisdom, love and intelligence to share with the world. You are here to make the world a better place. You have a purpose, and until you start living it you will have a void inside of you; a feeling you can’t quite explain, but that knows that you are meant for more. (Location 2035)

Achieving true happiness Happiness doesn’t come from other people, from places or things. It comes from within. (Location 2134)

To sustain happiness, you must work towards self-mastery. It’s an inward journey that requires substantial spiritual growth. Choosing empowering thoughts over limiting ones should become your natural way of thinking. You must make it a habit to look on the bright side of things and let go of the past; to stop living in the future and appreciate where you are and what you have right now; to withdraw from comparisons, and love everything in this world without condition. Embrace what is. Be happy. (Location 2161)

Remember, too, to trust your instincts. Listen to that feeling in your belly that warns you about a toxic relationship. Listen to that voice in your head that lets you know when you’re wasting your time. Respect your personal boundaries, and ask others to respect them, too. If something doesn’t feel right, it very well might not be. And if something feels wonderfully, deeply, powerfully right, it probably is. Go with that. Let it flow. (Location 2171)
