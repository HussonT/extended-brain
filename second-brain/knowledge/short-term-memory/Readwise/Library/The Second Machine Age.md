“Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God’s gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences.” —Freeman Dyson (Location 23)

Now comes the second machine age. Computers and other digital advances are doing for mental power—the ability to use our brains to understand and shape our environments—what the steam engine and its descendants did for muscle power. (Location 94)

We’ll show why and how the full force of these technologies has recently been achieved and give examples of its power. “Full,” though, doesn’t mean “mature.” Computers are going to continue to improve and to do new and unprecedented things. By “full force,” we mean simply that the key building blocks are already in place for digital technologies to be as important and transformational to society and the economy as the steam engine.

In short, we’re at an inflection point—a point where the curve starts to bend a lot—because of computers. We are entering a second machine age. (Location 123)

We’re heading into an era that won’t just be different; it will be better, because we’ll be able to increase both the variety and the volume of our consumption. (Location 125)

we need to understand its three key characteristics: that it is exponential, digital, and combinatorial. The next three chapters will discuss each of these in turn. (Location 541)

“And here I am thinking of those astonishing electronic machines . . . by which our mental capacity to calculate and combine is reinforced and multiplied by the process and to a degree that herald . . . astonishing advances.” —Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (Location 1240)
