A lot of people break down and become overwhelmed by the potential for failure and they fall apart. Coach’s whole philosophy was based around the idea that you don’t control the outcome, but you do control your preparation, you do control execution, you do control teamwork, and you do control effort. He believed in “trust the process”; give me those things that I know you can (Location 77)

Coach taught that mental toughness is the toughness that keeps your mind in control when your emotions are looking to take over. It is the toughness to focus on what you can control—effort and preparation—rather than thinking about what you don’t have control over: results. It’s a different sort of pressure. When the pressure is all about winning and losing, you have no control. Once he gave you all the control it turned pressure into opportunity . . . and a sense that because of our preparation and teamwork . . . it was an opportunity we looked toward with optimism.

Unfortunately, greatness rarely happens on accident. If you want to achieve excellence, you will have to act like you really want it. How? Quite simply: by dedicating time and energy into consistently doing what needs to be done. (Location 259)

Being accountable in the business world is extremely difficult for two reasons. First, we allow our schedules to become overpacked. Trying to do too much creates the conditions for increased stress and pressure in our lives. Many of us regularly feel overwhelmed by all the things that seemingly need to get done—so overwhelmed, in fact, that we reach the point of feeling as though we are unable to do anything at all.

Being accountable in the business world is extremely difficult for two reasons. First, we allow our schedules to become overpacked. Trying to do too much creates the conditions for increased stress and pressure in our lives. Many of us regularly feel overwhelmed by all the things that seemingly need to get done—so overwhelmed, in fact, that we reach the point of feeling as though we are unable to do anything at all. Cognitive dissonance (CD) is the second reason accountability eludes most people at home and work. CD is a self-protection mechanism that we humans use to justify our actions (or lack thereof). Our brains want our experience to line up with our beliefs, attitudes, and expectations; when there is a disconnect, or dissonance, we become so uncomfortable that we tend to change what we think to align with what we feel.

I want you to learn to view the pain that comes from underperforming as the “gift of accountability.” Allow the pain to serve as the motivation needed to work harder at becoming accountable to improvement. Without the pain and humiliation of coming up short, we have little impetus to change our current way of behaving. However, if every time you come up short with your kids, your spouse, your client, or your boss, you avoid making excuses and allow yourself to own the shortcoming and feel the pain of letting someone down, that pain can serve as motivation to improve in the future.

Accountability Exercise: Commit to full accountability for the next 24 hours. No matter what is on your schedule, make sure you follow through with every single thing you said you would do, and yes when you say to yourself or someone else that you will do something, you need to find a way to get it done. That is true accountability. Whether it be a promise you made your kids or spouse or something you said you would do for a client or coworker, find a way to get it done in its entirety. If you come up short, say the following word for word: “I’m sorry, there is no excuse, and I will work on making sure this never happens again.” Practice saying those exact words now, before you need to use them. Today may mark the first time you have ever given a true apology for being unaccountable. Remember, an apology with an excuse or justification isn’t a real apology. Others don’t feel better when they hear your excuses, so stop giving them. Increasing Focus In the 2006 World Series, the Detroit Tigers were unfocused. Unfortunately for Detriot manager Jim Leyland and the fans, the team lacked consistency and underper-formed on their potential. Leyland’s Tigers, considered a lock before the Series began, rushed through routine fielding plays and struggled in the batter’s box. They committed error after error (eight in total) and eventually lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in five games. The Tigers felt an enormous sense of pressure to beat a Cardinals team that had entered the play-offs ready and focused on the right fundamentals for winning. (Location 315)

A Scoreboard for Your Life When you watch a baseball game, it is easy to know who is winning: you look at the scoreboard and it’s right there in front of you to see. But how do you know if you are winning in life? The only true method of answering this question is to clearly define your win by delineating what is most important to you. (Location 463)

Ben identified his purpose and priorities in life; then he created something I call a “vision of self-image,” a 30-second mental video of the specifics of who you want to be and how you want your life to be in five years. In Ben’s vision of self-image, he laid out the specifics of the personal and professional success he wanted to accomplish. (Location 580)

You will act like the sort of person you conceive yourself to be. More important, you literally cannot act otherwise, in spite of all your conscious efforts or will-power. This is why trying to achieve something difficult with teeth gritted is a losing battle. Willpower is not the answer. Self-image management is. (Location 614)
