A good audio creator balances confidence and humility. They have a clear and confident idea of what they want to create and how to create it, yet they also realize that the podcast will only be as good as they make it. The true limits of its potential are the limits of their own skill. (Location 61)

I’ve also heard it said that “overconfidence is the enemy of good thinking,” and I think that applies to audio production as well. (Location 63)

As a creator, I believe in boundaries. Not as in narrow thinking, but that the best creativity comes from working around purposeful restrictions. Focus. (Location 66)

Whether you are new to podcasting or have lots of experience, finding a balance—between confidence and humility, between 2 being clear and focused, while remaining open, and understanding that there is always an opportunity to improve—is the nucleus of this book. (Location 67)

However, I have written this book assuming that you fall into one of three categories: 7 • A curious novice interested in starting a podcast. • An experienced maker looking to improve your skill or push your work to the next level. • Someone from a company or organization interested in using podcasting as a means to connect with audiences, customers, or like-minded people who share your interest in a subject, issue, hobby, lifestyle, or, basically, anything.

Classic rock. In the mood for the weather and local news? Boom. One button press and it is easy. Podcasting is different. Podcasting is more purposeful and granular. Not only are you 12 interested in a specific experience, but you may want to hear only a specific episode from that show. The level of selection is much more intentional. (Location 255)

Here is an idea that permeates everything in this book. I believe that the key to success in podcasting and audio of all sorts is learning to create empathetically—to learn to think about creation in the same way a listener hears that creation. Listeners are why we do this work—to reach people with stories and ideas. They are the audience for our expression. To properly align your thoughts with a listener, all that’s needed is to simply learn how to empathize with them. What do they want? What do they need? How do we put them first? There is a lot in here to help accomplish that too. (Location 259)

And, to me, “indistinguishable” is the enemy. As of this writing, there are more than 700,000 podcasts available today in 100 languages representing more than twenty million episodes. On one hand, there is a shocking amount of diversity: Almost every media outlet is experimenting or knee-deep in podcasting, and a wide variety of celebrities, companies, causes, enthusiasts, and interest groups have their own podcasts. It seems everyone from the President of the United States to the yoga instructor down the street has a podcast (Location 347)

Many people ape the style and aesthetics of other podcasts 19 because they think this is the pathway to success. Newsflash: It isn’t. The pathway to success in such a crowded, fast-moving field lies in being uniquely different. Uniquely yourself. Uniquely precise, exact, and clear in your vision.

Story. Character. Voice. Stated more specifically: • Compelling stories and ideas. • Engaging characters. • A unique voice. Every successful podcast, ever, has delivered on each of these three tenets. Regardless of form, format, or style, I’ve spent years trying to find an exception to this, and never have. You should consider hitting these marks to be your gateway to success, too. (Location 376)

All listeners are narcissists about their listening. And why shouldn’t they be? It’s their time. They don’t listen for any reason other than their own fulfillment and enjoyment. Period. They don’t listen because knowing a story, character, or situation is good for them. They don’t listen because they have nothing better to do. It has to pay off for them, every moment, every time. In a world of so much choice for entertaining things to listen to, it needs to be a pretty short walk (Location 407)

To understand why it is so important to start off with a clear and compelling direction, think of what your audience is doing while they listen. People are doing laundry and riding the subway to work. They are exercising, doing dishes, walking the dog. Podcasting is what’s known as a “companion medium,” meaning it is something you listen to while doing something else. It makes mundane activities less mundane. (Location 433)

I mention that story because it set a standard with me for the importance of characters. In podcasting, a critical element of success is a deep connection to the individuals you hear in a show. It isn’t that every character needs to be relatable and charm the listener, but there has to be some emotional anchor for the listener, someone they feel so interested in, connected to, and invested in (Location 455)

Ironically, trying too hard to be likable leads listeners in the opposite 25 direction. The eagerness pushes the listeners away. It’s a turnoff. But above all else, the most prevalent way characters fail is that they don’t feel authentic. They are two-dimensional, predictable, unrevealing, or clichéd. This is true for podcast hosts as characters. (Location 478)

The voice of a podcast is like a promise made to its audience: this is what we are going to do, and how it will be authentic and fit into the podcasting space. Sticking to that voice like it is sacrosanct is keeping that promise and demonstrating the creator’s respect for the audience. Here is a story about understanding a podcast’s voice and what happens when you violate the audience’s unspoken understanding about that voice. (Location 531)

In the survey, we learned that listeners felt the live shows violated the show’s voice. To them, Pop Culture Happy Hour was an intimate experience, like sitting at a table in a bar with four incredibly smart, well-informed, and charming friends. It felt personal and “just for them.” The live shows were anything but “just for them.” They felt big, impersonal, and the cheering, laughter, and applause from these increasingly large audiences violated the feeling of intimacy and, I 30 dare to say, their ownership of the show.

As feedback, I suggested that she would have an easier time with her project if she picked a lane: either use wording that everyone would understand or change her definition of her audience. After giving it some thought, she decided she wanted to change the audience. She and her cohosts would only be interested in listeners who already knew what intersectional feminism was, and she felt that was an important entry point for her audience. She could have just as easily gone in the opposite direction, but that would have been a very different podcast. In hers, she can assume a level of understanding, knowledge, empathy, perspective, and interest from her audience that a general audience program wouldn’t possess. (Location 698)

But most important, every time you make an editorial decision, you should ask yourself if you are keeping true to your vision. If you are considering booking a guest, and the conversation won’t match what you’ve written in your description, don’t book that person. If you are creating a multi-episode narrative and are unsure whether to include a scene or profile a character, think of your statement, and ask if what you’re considering serves or forwards that idea.

Lara—her background story, and what she meant for the dilemma faced by public radio—was the avatar for years of audience data and listener research. No one wants to hear all that data and research, and they likely would not understand it, especially in a quick meeting presentation. But people understand people. And a photo of a person can personify a group or situation more clearly than any chart or graph. And even if they could grasp all the data, what is the point? By selecting an avatar, we could take that mental energy and apply it to generating the ideas that will serve them rather than trying to 42 understand data. (Location 803)

If you get it right for Lara, the decisions, behaviors, and choices you’ve made along the way have made your project (or multiplatform network) accessible and enjoyable for many others along the way who will connect with Lara. In other words, what is good for Lara will be good for many others, perhaps even millions of others. (Location 811)

You need the audience, much more than they need you. You want them to feel welcome. You want them to feel like you are speaking just to them. They want to hear a small part of themselves being nurtured or nourished by what you do. They want you to help move them along on a journey to be a better version of themselves. If you talk down to a listener, talk over their heads, or sound like you are speaking to some-47 one else, that bond is almost impossible to build. (Location 899)

There is an old bromide in radio that tells announcers and disc jockeys to phrase everything like they are speaking to only one person. It builds connection, makes the listener feel like they are a part of things. It demonstrates empathy. I’d argue that podcasting’s need for an intimate one-on-one connection is ten times as important. (Location 903)

How do you want your project to affect them? What do you want them to think about? How do you want to make them feel? What is your project’s impact on its audience? Basically, what do you want to leave them with as a result of the time they spend with you and your show? (And we talk about this in the next chapter.) It is an important element of a project’s design to think about the end point—the outcome. Why are we all doing this, all this creation and storytelling? I emphasize this element of the exercise because I find it so hard to map out a journey unless I know where I’m going. To me, the end is the effect on the listener. (Location 916)

Each corner of the triangle represented the “what,” “who,” and “why” we discussed at the end of the previous chapter. Each corner was a question I needed him to answer, the answers locking together to form a foundation for a potential podcast idea. But as we talked, I realized there were actually four questions, so on the fly I started calling it a quadrangle.12 But as we spoke, I started drawing curved lines between the quadrangle points and soon realized I was drawing a circle, a Four-Pointed Circle. Imagine a circle with four equi-distant dots on it, with each question leading into the next answer. • • • • As Joe and I spoke, and I started to sketch the circle, I wrote a 53 word at each point to represent the questions I needed Joe to answer. • THEM WHY • •WHAT • YOU I explained what each point meant: • YOU: Who are you? • THEM: Who are you speaking to? • WHAT: What do you have to say? • WHY: What effect do you want to have on them?

Joe is a yoga instructor, a life coach, a husband, and other things, too. Which version of Joe is he going to feature in this podcast?

A podcast episode should be as long as it needs to be, but no longer. One of the many Function and Form benefits of podcasting for creators is that you are no longer slave to a clock. Broadcasters live and die by the clock, but in the on-demand world, there are no such constraints. There literally are no rules, so don’t make dumb ones for no reason. I’ve heard terrific podcast episodes that are three minutes long, and I’ve heard terrific podcast episodes that are—no lie—four and a half hours long. The episode should have pacing and rhythm and should convey a set of clear ideas, and that can take as long as it needs to, but not longer than it needs to. (Location 1140)

PEOPLE CHATTING • RANT: A rant is when a person shares an idea or opinion. That person is often a well-known thought leader, personality, leading voice in a field, or from a specific worldview, though sometimes it is just a regular person with something to get off their chest. Rants are one-way conversations from the podcast star to the audience. (Location 1156)

As Guy was pointing out, when you are making decisions about what form a project should take, you need to factor in not only the limits of your imagination, but the limits of your resources, too. You must factor in constraints, and factoring in constraints to your ambition is one way of determining form. As Guy and I were speaking, I started to doodle in my notebook.

ASKING QUESTIONS (Location 1432)

why most interviewers fail; and the fix for almost all bad interviews is extraordinarily simple. It isn’t the questions. It isn’t the lack of rapport. I believe that the most common pitfall in interviews is the interviewer trying to play the role of “The Interviewer.” The person conducting the interview walks in with a role in mind of how someone conducting an interview should act, and they, basically, act out that part. The Interviewer knows the subject so well they can recall even esoteric facts about minor things. The Interviewer asks deep questions. The Interviewer is buddies with the subject (or at least the subject likes The Interviewer). The Interviewer is clever and funny. The Interviewer is serious (except when The Interviewer is supposed to be charming). The Interviewer nods their head a lot and is deeply 78 engaged. The interviewee being interviewed by The Interviewer often starts answers with “No one has ever asked me that before.” At the end of the interview, the subject must thank The Interviewer for the best interview they’ve ever done. I’m not saying that these are somehow wrong or shouldn’t be a result of conducting a good interview, but being The Interviewer isn’t the role you should play when conducting an interview. The role you should play . . . is you. (Location 1464)

enjoy listening to them as a construct and form, and believe that some kinds of stories and ideas emerge better through an interview than through a traditional narrative. When it comes down to it, most times you hear someone talking in a narrative podcast (other than the host), that tape came from an interview. So, therefore, knowing what you are doing—and doing it well—will serve you regardless of the format of your project. Interviews are both formal and intimate; they are revealing and focused.

While this book is about teaching you to think like a listener, this chapter will also help you learn to think like an interviewer. Because what defines a good interviewer truly is someone who is comfortable using themselves as a proxy for the audience. Using your own natural curiosity as a proxy for theirs. Not to ask every question an audience of thousands might think to ask, but to ask questions that you want to know the answers to, and having the confidence that there are probably many others in your audience who want to know the same things.

When someone starts a question with “So, I was wondering,” the question is almost always going to get an answer worth hearing. The catch is that it has to be something you were genuinely wondering about. (Location 1529)

Most interviewers think their job is to ask questions that evoke answers, which is slightly off. In truth, your job is to be curious. To be more specific, your job is to allow your natural curiosity to emerge in questions you choose to ask. Your job is to wonder. (Location 1531)

The same idea applies to interviews. While I stand by my asser-tion that the main requirement of an interviewer is to be curious, I’d say that a tight second place goes to listening. Great interviewing comes from great listening, listening by you. Your goal as an interviewer should be to do as little of the talking as possible. Just be quiet. Unlike in a normal conversation, silence can be your friend in an interview setting. When someone is being interviewed, they, too, are playing a role, “The Interview Subject” (or perhaps “The 22 As of this writing, in his fifth decade on the radio, Joey is still doing a weekly show on Sunday nights.

Interviewee”). However, in this case, having an assumed set of expectations isn’t a bad thing, because the job description for The Interviewee is basically to talk. I find that whenever I interview someone, if I let some silence fall between their answer and my next question or statement, they realize they aren’t fulfilling their end of the bargain and feel compelled to rush in and fill it by talking. And often what they say to fill silence is the best part of their answer. (Location 1574)

Beforehand, they told you the answer they had planned to give, but when there is silence, and they rush into that quiet to be The Interviewee, they say things that go beyond the early comfortable answer, offering something more, something deeper, something fresh that they haven’t thought or said before.

It’s worth noting that you should save the silence for when you think it will reveal the most useful answer. If you allow silence between every answer and question, (a) your interviewee will probably catch on, and (b) it will create a lot of weird energy, pacing, and discomfort between you and the subject. Your goal is to keep them there, keep them 84 engaged, and most important, keep them talking. (Location 1580)

Before the conversation starts, as you and the subject are getting settled, it is very common to go over the ground rules for an interview: thanking them again for doing it, how to handle it if they need a break or want to do an answer over again, etc. During this exchange, simply add something like: “Look, I really want this interview to focus on you, so don’t be surprised if I’m not saying much. I want to give you as much time to answer. So if I’m not stopping you or asking another question, please feel free to keep going!” Remember that they know, sometimes quite explicitly, that their 86 role as The Interviewee is to talk. That’s what they signed on for, that is what they know they are supposed to do. So, if you say up front that they have the room and freedom to take as much time as they want answering, let them! You should be prepared to do a lot of editing on what they say, but what you will end up with will be more interesting, more revealing, and more fun to listen to than the short, pithy crap you may get with short answers.

If your interview is part of a larger narrative or story about something that happened, then read and learn as much about the story as possible.

And here is a protip: An easy way to get fresh material is to walk your subject through some of the things you read, heard, and saw in the coverage of the story from others. At worst, you’ll get back an answer like: “Yup, that’s how it happened.” But in my experience, more times than not, your interview subject will find the fresh angle on the story for you.

the best way to express your recognition is by being grateful, kind, and respectful. Grateful doesn’t mean fawning or excessive thanks. Kindness and respect don’t mean asking only easy questions or avoiding sensitive topics. It means be prompt, have your act together, and let them know you are taking their time seriously. It means telling them the ground rules of the interview, if and when they can stop to take a break or think over something they want to say, and so on. (Location 1689)

It is important to embrace them for what they really are: They exist in wholly artificial environments and depend on wholly unnatural interactions with people who often don’t 91 have any business asking or answering these questions. It’s weird for them and for you. You don’t need to be friends. It doesn’t even matter if the interviewee likes you. Your objective should be to make them feel respected for the wisdom, expertise, and experience they are about to share with you. You should strive to make them feel comfortable doing so. But that doesn’t mean you have to have a bond—even a fake bond—that has even a flicker of a chance of existing outside of the moment. (Location 1689)

AN INTERVIEW IS A STORY An interview isn’t just questions and answers. It is an opportunity to learn—for both you and your listener. And like everything else in the world, learning is easier when it is in the frame of a story. That is why it is best to think of your interview as a narrative and structure it accordingly. Whether you are filling in details of a story, or trying to tell a story with an interview, interviews are stories. Not only is this true, (Location 1719)

When you think of the questions you want to ask and the story you want to tell in narrative order, it’s easier to conduct the interview, as well as edit it afterward. When an interview isn’t well structured, it requires you and the subject to go back and forth in time, or for you to ask about various pieces of information in a random way. Without that structure, the story you are telling won’t build logically, and it will be confusing for you, the subject, and ultimately, for the listener. It helps the interviewee if you have a sense of direction and if the questions you’re asking are building on the questions that you’ve already asked. That way you can just keep going deeper. The best way to organize this is to think in chapters. For example, if you are interviewing a musician, you might have a chapter on their formative years when they were first starting to play.

To be honest, it’s actually rude to your audience and is almost certain to limit the appeal of your show to potential listeners. By saying this, I know I stand the risk of alienating the tens of thousands of podcasters who don’t edit interviews. So be it. (Location 1748)

In all my writing, I tend to write a lot, often two or three times the amount I will ultimately keep. I do it to put everything in my head on the page, then I groom and trim it down to the most relevant parts, trying to offer just enough to translate these ideas to you. But, trust me, you don’t want everything. Getting everything would actually make it less accessible and, ironically, harder for you to understand. (Location 1765)

The first thing to do when editing your interview is to really establish what you have. To do this, you should “log your tape” or create an outline (with time marks) for the interview you recorded. To some, logging is very close to transcribing (which I’ll touch on shortly), but your first pass on logging is simply meant as a road map to help you get your hands (and head) around all the tape you’ve gathered (in some cases, many hours of it). If you are conducting your own interview, logging can be done afterward. If you are a producer logging an interview conducted by someone else, you can do a lot of your logging during the recording itself (more on this in the next chapter). (Location 1807)

An unintended benefit of tape logging is that it really helps you get familiar with your recording by forcing you to listen carefully and take notes on what was said and what happened. When I’m editing, I really need to have the entire thing in my head; I want to be able to navigate every corner of what was recorded. That way, when I’m looking at a transcribed bit of tape later, I don’t need to listen to the tape very much while I’m making choices about what to use and what (Location 1833)

to toss. The log and transcript are just there to allow me to hear it in my head. There is another unintended benefit of tape logging that my company’s cofounder, Jesse Baker, credits with having a lot of influence on her as a producer. When she first moved to New York City, she called up a few shows and asked if she could do some tape logging. (Location 1839)

Once it is transcribed, I use the transcript as my main editing tool. I do what we call a “paper edit” before I try to digitally edit the interview. First, I listen again to the interview while reading along with the transcript, and I make a lot of notes in the margins about things that go beyond words: emotion, interesting moments of pause or reflection, interesting sounds (if you are interviewing them outdoors). I also strike through everything that I know I won’t use. Then it is a process of winnowing down. Highlight and make note of passages that work best. Continue to strike out others. Make notes about how to rearrange segments that need it. (Location 1850)

Regardless of how you work, from a tape log, quick machine AI transcript, or a full-on transcript, the last step is always the same: Take all your notes, pages, and strips of paper and begin to digitally edit your interview, using your edited log and/or transcript as a guide. Then listen through what you’ve done, make notes on what still isn’t working, and do it all again.28 And often, you repeat this process several times to get it perfect. (Location 1861)

Its creator, Stephen Schwartz, was an American who worked for the Danish Broadcasting Corporation for more than thirty years and became a specialist in documentary features produced without outside narration. Over the years, I have often heard international audio producers discuss two different forms of audio documentary and feature production: the “American” style of production and the “Danish” (or sometimes referred to as the “European”) style of production. “American” style audio documentaries feature a host/producer/ reporter narrating the action (think This American Life, Radiolab, or 99% Invisible). The host/producer/reporter is an intricate part of the story and is in the foreground of the action. The “Danish” style of audio documentary favors “self-narrated” storytelling, where the 100 people being documented are the only voices you hear. There is no narrator or host reading scripted copy, asking questions on tape, or making observations. If the subject didn’t say it, it isn’t included in the production.

But they quickly learned that not all subjects are natural storytellers. So how do you get John Q. Public to tell you a rich, captivating version of their story? A simple way to infuse emotion and make a 29 Though, honestly, you could do this in just about any location. Asking Questions well-worn story told in an interview more vivid is to tap into the teller’s memory of details they probably hadn’t shared in earlier tellings. When someone first shares a story—be it something that happened to them, that they witnessed, or that they are reporting on, they tend to offer a chronological factual recitation of basic facts: what happened, who it happened to, and how it ended. It’s surprising how many stories go no further than this. But we experience the world with all our sense and emotions, which provides you, as an interviewer, an opportunity to evoke new descriptive elements of the story as told to you. That’s where the Full Schwartz comes in. (Location 1892)

The Full Schwartz is pretty easy to execute. 1. In a pre-interview or conversation before going into the studio, work 101 with the subject to identify some key scenes in the story. Imagine the moment as if it were a photograph, and go over a lot of what was going on in that scene. While it is the subject’s story, it is really up to you to flag the pivotal moments in the story. 2. Prepare the studio (or other quiet place) for the interview by lowering or turning off the lights, putting cushions on the floor, and lighting some candles.30 3. Get the subject comfortable lying on the ground, and have your subject close their eyes. Do a bit of deep breathing to really get them relaxed. 4. Place the mic (on a boom stand) very close to the subject’s mouth and encourage them to speak in a calm, quiet voice. 5. Tell the subject that you want to revisit some of the scenes in their 30 Every telling of the Full Schwartz (Location 1903)

story. Select the pivotal moments and have the subject talk about them as if they were describing a photograph. The key is to get them to describe every detail. After they answer, repeatedly ask them for more detail and what happened next. 6. In addition to describing the scene like a photograph, get the subject to focus on other internal details: What were they feeling at that moment? What were they thinking? Were there smells, sounds, or other sensations that stuck out to them? Two keys to making the Schwartz Technique work. First, be prepared to really make them go over and over the pivotal scenes. Ask for more detail, then ask for even more. Evoke their full range of senses and emotions at that moment. Ask if they remember feeling hot or cold. Are there any smells associated with the moment? Was it very bright or dark outside? Was there music playing that may have matched the moment? Ask them if they remember what they were 102 feeling at that moment. Ask them if they thought anything to themselves at that moment. For example, if they are describing a touchdown catch that ended the championship game, ask if the receiver was running or standing still when he caught the ball. Did he jump into the air to catch it or was he on the ground? Were any tufts of grass kicked up during the play? How many other players were gathered around? Of course someone won’t remember every detail, but don’t assume they haven’t retained any details. They will surprise you with what they remember. Dig deep and keep asking them what they saw and what details they remember. And be prepared to go over the same scene many times. Second, and most important, coach the subject to speak in an active voice and ask them to rephrase their recollections accordingly. Instead of saying “I remember that the coach threw down his clipboard and I think he screamed out in joy,” ask them to say, “The coach threw down his clipboard and screamed out in joy.” There is also a variation on the Schwartz Technique known as The Half Schwartz. It is a lighter, slightly less odd version of The Full Asking Questions Schwartz. (Location 1914)

When using The Half Schwartz, you don’t ask the subject to lie on the ground in the dark. Instead, you dim the lights and ask them to sit in a chair. You still ask them to close their eyes and focus on the scenes you’ve identified, but without the extra ambient flair. (Location 1932)

When someone describes an event or happening, ask them: “How was this different than you expected or imagined it would turn out?” • When you are talking to someone who is accomplished in a cer-103 tain field, ask them: “Why do people fail doing what you do?” • When interviewing someone who has been repeatedly profiled in the past, I like to ask: “What do people often get wrong about you?” (Or “wrong about your work,” “wrong about your books,” “wrong about people like you,” and so on.) Not only does it often open up an avenue for your interview, but it helps you avoid mistakes made by others.

a narrative structure and planning to edit extensively afterward. She often gives a few other pieces of advice: • You should know as much as you can about a person and their work or their field of expertise in the amount of time that you have to prepare. • You don’t need to know everything, and you don’t need to be able to write a dissertation on it yourself. You don’t have to become the expert, but you have to know enough to know what makes this person special. • Ask “What do you want from them?” That might be their personal story. It might be insights into their field. But you have to have a sense of “Why am I talking to this person?” • Map out how you will illustrate what makes this person special. Remember that if you just sit down and ask generic questions, 105 you might never get there. Unless you’ve done some research, you won’t know what they said a hundred times before that you don’t need them to say again to you. So what does arguably one of the greatest interviewers in the world hear as a common mistake with interviewers? Being slavish to your list of questions: “I think a common mistake people make, especially when they’re starting, is that they’ve written out their questions and they’re gonna stick to them no matter what,” she says. “And as much as I suggest having a narrative order for your questions, I don’t think that you should feel wedded to them. You should feel free to listen and ask follow-up questions, and follow the interview where it leads you, knowing that you have the structure to come back to, if and when you need it. But writing questions doesn’t absolve you from listening and responding.” (Location 1969)
