From our interviews six key responsibilities emerged: setting the direction, aligning the organization, mobilizing through leaders, engaging the board, connecting with stakeholders, and managing personal effectiveness. (Location 128)

The key takeaway was that despite their different approaches, every CEO at every stage of their tenure meaningfully tended to all six responsibilities. The best CEOs kept all six plates spinning at all times, even if the external and internal environment meant that some needed to be spun faster or slower than others. (Location 149)

They instead create significant value on a sustained basis year after year during their tenures. They do so by periodically redefining what it means to win and refreshing their strategies with new, bold actions. (Location 156)

“A big part of your job is dealing with all the unsolved problems.” It’s no wonder that Stanford University Professor of economics Nicholas Bloom, who has spent much of his career researching CEO effectiveness, says, “It’s frankly a horrible job. I wouldn’t want it. Being the CEO of a big company is a hundred-hour-a-week job. It consumes your life. It consumes your weekend. It’s super-stressful. Sure, there’re enormous perks, but it’s also all-encompassing.” (Location 182)

They embrace uncertainty with a view that fortune favors the bold. They’re less a “taker” of their fate and more a “shaper”—constantly looking for and acting on opportunities that bend the curve of history. CEOs who embrace this mindset are well aware that only 10 percent of companies create 90 percent of the total economic profit (profit after subtracting the cost of capital) and that the top quintile performers deliver thirty times more economic profit than the companies in the next three quintiles combined. And here’s the kicker: The odds of moving from being an average performer to a top-quintile performer over a ten-year period are only one in twelve.12 Knowing just how low the odds of success are, the best CEOs apply boldness to each of the three dimensions of direction setting—vision, strategy, and resource allocation, as we’ll discuss in the chapters that follow. CHAPTER 1 Vision Practice Reframe the Game Your playing small does not serve the world. —Marianne Williamson In a pivotal scene in the biographical movie Invictus, Nelson Mandela asks Francois Pienaar, the captain of the South African National Rugby team, “How do you inspire your team to do their best?” Pienaar unflinchingly responds, “By example. I’ve always thought to lead by example.” Mandela reflects, “That is exactly right. But how to get them to be better than they think they can be? That is very difficult, I find.

As we spoke to the most successful CEOs, we were struck by how they similarly reframed what winning meant for their companies. They didn’t just raise aspiration levels; they changed the definition of success. (Location 262)

The “reframe the game” visions in the table above may look obvious after the fact, but getting to the right one is harder than one might think. As Hastings, a self-professed student of how corporations rise and fall, describes: “You definitely want to define what your space of interest is, what you’ll go after and defend. But firms can get that definition wrong all the time.” (Location 331)

“First of all, you have to be mission critical to your customers, not just a ‘nice to have,’ ” Tan shares. “Second, you’ve got to be a category leader—number one or number two in your product lines. Third, your current total available market (TAM) is only worth $10 billion. How are you going to grow to be a $150 billion platform—how will you expand into new markets?” By looking for where those three pieces of advice intersected, Tan was able to reframe Cadence’s game and expand beyond making software that designs computer chips to also providing system design and analysis software for such industries as hyperscale computing, aerospace, automotive, and mobile.

Look Back to Look Forward Reframing the game doesn’t necessarily mean creating a vision that departs from a company’s heritage. Our research found that the best CEOs often dig back into a company’s history to find out what originally made it successful and then take that central idea and expand it in ways that open up new opportunities.

This reveals an important truth about human nature. As Medtronic’s Bill George puts it, “people support what they help create.” In fact, they’re some five times more supportive than those who aren’t involved. The underlying psychology relates to our desire for control, which is a deep-rooted survival instinct. (Location 453)

Invest. If you want your company’s investments to be big enough to move the needle, your capital expenditures to sales ratio needs to exceed 1.7 times the industry median for ten years. That’s a big number, but when capital is spent wisely it can enable a company to expand faster than its industry. (Location 539)

CEOs who make too few moonshot-size moves—or make them too late in their tenure—fall behind the pack. An analysis of the data shows that of the companies in the middle quintiles of economic profit creation, roughly 40 percent didn’t make any big moves at all over a ten-year period. (Location 560)

The advice had a profound impact on the new CEO and from then on he always made decisions as if he owned 100 percent of the company. “That way,” Breen shares, “you don’t have to worry about all the various constituencies, because you know you’ve made the right decision for the company. It’s not that you ignore them—whether it’s vendors, customers, employees, or investors—but, once you know you’ve arrived at the right decision, it’s just a matter of how you handle it with the board, the management team, the employees, and so on.” (Location 729)

You have to ask the question: ‘Why should we exist ten years from now?’ It’s an existential issue to change enough, regularly enough. If you’re not doing this, you’re not going to be around.” While leading McKinsey, Barton effectively moved the firm from providing good advice to also becoming an implementation partner to its clients. Among many “heart paddles” applied, he retooled the firm’s fee structure based on the impact of advice given to its clients, expanded services beyond consulting to include helping clients implement change, and invested heavily in building advanced data and analytics capabilities.

Thinking like an outsider when it comes to reallocation means a CEO isn’t wed to tradition, encumbered by internal loyalties, or willing to bow to short-term pressures.

But what if the “anchor” is replaced by zero? No investment is taken as a given—every investment is scrutinized, alternatives explored, and approval justified by how it helps deliver against the company’s strategy and vision. This is what we mean by taking a “zero-based” approach to resource allocation. It’s a more arduous approach, but the best CEOs believe it’s well worth it. (Location 872)

Kill as Much as You Create Talking about resource allocation in broad terms risks oversimplifying the choices facing CEOs. In reality, allocation comprises four fundamental activities: seeding, nurturing, pruning, and harvesting. Seeding is entering new business areas, whether through an acquisition or an organic start-up investment. Nurturing involves building up an existing business through investments, including acquisitions that strengthen the original business. Pruning takes resources away from an existing business, either by giving some of its annual capital allocation to others or by putting part of the business up for sale. Finally, harvesting is selling or spinning off whole businesses that no longer fit a company’s portfolio. (Location 964)

The best resource allocators justify every investment from scratch by starting with a zero base. They make it clear that the good of the whole company will be put ahead of any one area. They manage less by annual budgets and more by performance milestones, making resource allocation a continuous (not cyclical) process. Lastly, they kill off as much as they start through thoughtful pruning and harvesting. (Location 1023)

“Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” Most CEOs understand this and readily acknowledge that the soft stuff is hard to get right.

DBS’s Piyush Gupta shares, “When you’re CEO, you’ve got to realize that every time you say or do something, it’s got a massive consequential effect.

By taking such a laserlike approach, they can rigorously reshape the employee work environment and measure progress in a disciplined way. And the best CEOs reinforce the effort by showing, through actions and words, that they can change themselves. Getting the culture right is but the first leg of a three-legged stool used to support an organization’s delivery of vision and strategy. Mindful of management expert Arthur W.

Think Helix, Not Matrix As we listened closely to how the best CEOs create accountability within a complex and multidimensional matrix, we realized they didn’t actually think in terms of a matrix at all. It struck us that a more apt representation is a helix. The idea is inspired by the distinctive, double-stranded shape of DNA that scientists discovered in the early 1950s. The two long helical (like a corkscrew) DNA strands are intertwined without touching one another other than being connected through nucleotide pairs that run between them—sort of like a twisted ladder, as depicted below.31 (Location 1427)

In a helix organization, it’s not a “dual hard line” or a “dotted line” reporting structure. Rather, it’s a “split hard line” where an employee reports to two different leaders for two different purposes (thus the two intertwined strands). The split hard line construct doesn’t apply to every job in an organization, but for roles in complex matrices where sales channel, product, and functional expertise need to come together on behalf of the customer, a helix approach provides an elegant and pragmatic solution.

Make “Smart” Choices With a Goldilocks answer to centralization and accountability clear in a more “helix-like” than “matrix-like” manner, the foundation is set to determine what elements of the organization design will be stable and what will be agile. When it comes to making these choices, a smartphone analogy can be helpful. Think of choosing the stable elements as equivalent to choosing the hardware and operating system for your device. These provide a stable base on which you will then put numerous apps (the agile elements) that can be installed, upgraded, and discarded as needed to continually make life easier and better.

Another method to increase agility at Intuit was giving all employees 10 percent unstructured time. As Smith puts it, “We had more than 1,800 different experiments going on at any one time. If you had an experiment that proved successful in the eyes of our customers, we would fund your idea for another three months.” The result? As Smith shares, “It really helped us bring down the barriers of organization design, because everyone felt empowered to push their ideas out.” (Location 1480)

Explicitly making choices as to what will be stable and what will be agile is the key to breaking the otherwise predictable cycle of going through large-scale redesigns every couple of years. Instead, high-performing organizations continuously reorganize themselves around a stable core. Their stability makes them as reliable in performance as a high-end smartphone, and their agile apps drive continuous improvement ahead of less flexible competition. (Location 1484)

The best CEOs take the red pill. It enables them to resist the temptation to swing the pendulum back and forth between centralization and decentralization. It causes them to solve for clear accountability even in complex organization structures, rising above the matrix to reconfigure it as a helix. It prompts them to make smart choices about what the stabile and agile elements of the organization’s design are. Although it’s a more difficult path, taking the red pill as we’ve described it increases the odds from 25 to 86 percent of your organization redesign being a success, and very likely it will make your employees feel like they’ve been freed from a prison.

the same way the Navy leadership first defines the role of a Navy SEAL and then finds recruits who fit the job, the best CEOs know that building a great organization doesn’t start with people but, instead, with roles. They first ask themselves what the most important jobs are and define the knowledge, skills, attributes, and experiences needed to get those jobs done. (Location 1550)

Clearly Define High Value Roles We’ve helped numerous CEOs work with their CHROs and CFOs to develop a more rigorous understanding of the roles that drive their company’s strategy.

Don’t Forget Your “Left Tackles” When asked who the highest paid player on an American football team is, most will correctly identify the quarterback, because he executes most of the plays.

Fans of the movie The Blind Side, the story of a homeless teenager who grows up to be a star left tackle in the National Football League, know better.

The best CEOs dig deeper and ensure enough rigor and discipline is applied to finding the “left tackle” positions that protect and enable value to be created. In Trakulhoon’s case, his strategy was to move from commodity to higher value-added products, and that meant roles that had been overlooked by the previous regime became important. The research function was elevated, and its leader was recognized as a “left tackle”—one of the most important people on the team, even though by traditional measures that role had been considered less crucial.

Among the five or more potential candidates for each critical role, the best CEOs also expect to see multiple diversity lenses applied. At Merck, for example, as CEO Ken Frazier shares, “At the time [before I was the CEO], I was minding my business practicing law in Philadelphia, representing Merck among others. The only reason I’m the CEO of Merck today is that Roy Vagelos, who was CEO then, called me into his office and said, ‘I’m two years from retirement. I can’t seem to get my colleagues, my white colleagues, to promote any African Americans. Guess what, I’m going to make your career. I’m going to take a lawyer who has all the right raw material. I’m going to bring him inside the company. I’m going to give him a job in the business and I’m going to mentor him.’ And on my best day as CEO, I’m simply channeling what Roy taught (Location 1677)

Without a data-driven approach to talent, it’s easy to see how personnel conversations get bogged down. Myriad social considerations become barriers to action. What about those employees loyal to the executive in question, will they leave? What about the customers who they interact with, how will they respond? Does the board share the same view of their performance? Given their loyalty for many years, will it be seen as heartless to let them go? Do we have a viable successor? And so on. (Location 1724)

JPMC’s Jamie Dimon puts a fine point on the issue: “When someone asks me how I can demote a wonderful person, a loyal, ‘pillar of society’ out of a role where they aren’t the best fit, the answer is simple. They’re no longer doing a good job. If we were ‘loyal’ to them by leaving them in the job, we’d be hugely disloyal to everyone else and to the company’s clients. That, right there, is the hardest part about talent management.” (Location 1730)

To what extent am I personally acting as a role model by telling a deeply compelling story, aligning incentives, and building the confidence and skills of others? Are accountabilities clear, and is work organized in a way that isn’t overly rigid but also prevents chaos? Is the best-fit talent in the most important roles? Do I have a reliable way to measure if the “soft stuff” is moving in the right direction, and do I course-correct accordingly? If you do the hard work of getting good answers to these questions, executing your strategy becomes far easier. (Location 1743)

The best CEOs recognize this challenge and acknowledge that it’s their leadership that will determine whether their team’s work will live up to its potential and propel the company forward. When thinking about how to get the most out of their leaders, many CEOs start with questions such as, “How often should we meet?” and “What should be on the agenda?” The best, however, think less about what the team does together, and more about how the team works together.

Before removing someone from the team, the best CEOs make sure that the following questions can be answered in the affirmative: Does the team member know exactly what’s expected of them: i.e., what the agenda is and what jobs need to be done to drive that agenda? Have they been given the needed tools and resources, and a chance to build the necessary skills and confidence to use them effectively? Are they surrounded by others (including the CEO) who are aligned on a common direction and who display the desired mindsets and behaviors? Is it clear what the consequences are if they don’t get on board and deliver? It’s surprising how often less adept CEOs can’t say “yes” to all of these questions before acting. Lars Rebien Sørensen, the former CEO of the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, ensures he can answer in the affirmative. Sørensen, whom the Harvard Business Review named the top-ranked CEO in the world in 2015, was, at one point, pressured to remove a division head because that business was seen as not scaling up fast enough to meet market demand. Sørensen, however, was against firing the leader because he’d concluded that the poor performance was the result of the company’s not investing enough in manufacturing capacity—resources that would have allowed the division to build the competencies required to fulfill its mission. With the proper resources, the head of manufacturing was able to turn around the situation and keep his job. To be clear, we’re not talking about keeping low performers or even letting average performers hang around. It’s about giving leaders who have been average under a previous administration an opportunity (Location 1848)

Building a broader leadership coalition not only gives CEOs more leverage in driving the organization forward, but it also puts pressure on the top team members who must respond to the leaders below them whom the CEO has trained to have the same vision about the direction of the company.

When it comes to putting together a team, the best CEOs look for leaders who aren’t just interested in being all-stars, but also want and have the skills to build an all-star team. They then put the conditions in place for each team member to be successful, while maintaining enough distance to objectively judge and act on their performance. They also proactively engage leaders beyond their immediate team. (Location 1941)

There is one further team construct that the best CEOs have that we haven’t talked about here: the formation of a small informal team, sometimes known as a “kitchen cabinet.” Such a team typically provides a safe place to discuss highly sensitive issues and provides radically unfiltered feedback. The construct, however, tends to be highly personal, and as such we’ll talk more about the value, composition, and use of such a group of informal advisors later when we discuss the CEO’s responsibility to manage personal effectiveness.

Paradoxes of Group Life. Here are just three examples: People feel pressure to conform to the group, yet the power of the group comes from leveraging the individuality of its members. A team leader must ask success-oriented people to risk failure. The work of those in power positions is to create the conditions in which others are powerful. Adidas’s Herbert Hainer adds to these complex dynamics the fact that: “Executives tend to be alpha leaders and competitive,” and it’s easy to see why a high-performing top team is not a foregone conclusion, even when it’s made up of highly talented individuals.

In keeping with how Kelly took on the team dynamics challenge at Westpac, the best CEOs build high performing teams by… … ensuring that their team does work that only it can do … clearly defining what it means to be a member on the “first team” … combining dialogue, data, and speed in decision-making … investing regularly in team building (Location 1996)

Do Work That Only the Team Can Do In his 1958 book The Pursuit of Progress, C. Northcote Parkinson described a common way a team can become dysfunctional. He tells the story of an executive team that was gathered to make three investment decisions. First, they discussed the investment for a £10 million nuclear power plant. This decision was approved in two and a half minutes. The next agenda item was to decide which color to paint their bike shed (total cost about £350). After a forty-five-minute discussion, the decision was made. Third, the staff needed a new coffee machine, which would roughly cost £21. The committee discussed this topic for one hour and fifteen minutes and decided to postpone the decision until the next meeting.45 The story illustrates what is known as the “law of triviality” (also referred to as the “bike shed effect”), where groups of people have a strong tendency to give disproportionate attention to trivial issues and details—in particular, those the entire group can relate to (and therefore have strong opinions about). The bike shed effect often leads to team members voicing complaints that “we spend too much time in meetings,” to which the well-intentioned response is to consolidate meetings. This only exacerbates the problem, however. More ends up packed into less time in a less effective format, making the time spent feel even more senseless. Our research and that of others fully backs up how real these dynamics are. (Location 2001)

Priority work for the top team typically includes: corporate strategy (priorities, targets, M&A), large-scale allocation of resources, identifying synergies and interdependencies across business units, validating decisions that significantly affect all employees, assuring delivery of company financial targets, providing direction for major company-wide projects, reinforcing the desired company culture (including individual and collective role modeling), and building the company’s leadership bench strength (which includes providing feedback to one another).

Define the “First Team” Norms Once there’s clarity on what topics team time will be spent on, the next step is to gain the same degree of clarity on how those topics will be tackled, which starts by establishing the mindset that the top team is every member’s “first team.” (Location 2028)

As we’ve already seen, many CEOs have a catchphrase to capture the essence of the first team mindset. Marillyn Hewson describes this ethos as being part of “One Lockheed Martin.” Similarly, Flemming Ørnskov called it “One Shire,” and Sony’s Kazuo Hirai rallied his troops around “One Sony.” (Location 2045)

Having established the first team mindset, the next step the best CEOs take is to make sure their teams understand how decisions will be made. While methods vary, all emphasize data, dialogue, and speed. (Location 2066)

Combine Data, Dialogue, and Speed “In God we trust, all others bring data” is a famous quote often attributed to management scientist W. Edwards Deming. The quote espoused his fundamental philosophy that data measurement and analysis are essential to making good management decisions. The best CEOs adhere to this mantra. Brad Smith describes a method he used to ensure decisions were data-driven at Intuit: “Our decision-making principles insist on evidence. One of the mottos at Intuit is, ‘Because of (blank), I believe we should do (blank).’ (Location 2068)

Dialogue only works, however, if the team members are free of bias. The most common bias is groupthink: our tendency to back an idea based on how favorably we believe others will view that decision. Another is the confirmation bias, where one accepts information that confirms one’s beliefs and resists any information to the contrary. A third prevalent bias is the optimism bias: the assumption and expectation that the best possible outcome will emerge. The best CEOs proactively mitigate the impact of such biases. (Location 2080)

At DBS, Piyush Gupta created a mechanism called MOJO to ensure meetings were productive. The “MO” stands for the Meeting Owner who makes sure the objectives of the meeting are clear, the right attendees and information are present, and that the discussion is well organized and led. The “JO” is the Joyful Observer, whose role is to critique the meeting. According to Gupta, “the fact you have someone sitting there empowered to say, ‘Hey, this is how the meeting is going, this worked, this didn’t work, this isn’t getting to the point’ made a massive difference.” DBS also created a simple tool to enable every meeting to be evaluated afterward by the participants, the results of which are shared with the meeting owner, a technique common in organizations led by the best CEOs.

The first is alignment on direction—a shared belief about what the company is striving toward and the role of the team in getting there. The second is high-quality interaction, characterized by trust, open communication, and a willingness to embrace conflict.

Many teams benefit, as Gail Kelly’s did at Westpac, from having an executive coach or some other impartial facilitator lead discussions related to three dimensions of team performance. Piyush Gupta shares his experience at DBS: “We had the Authentic Leadership Institute come and spend a couple days with us doing Organizational Behavior kind of work. It was cathartic. We all looked deep into ourselves and said, ‘What are we about? And what’s our purpose? And what makes us tick? And how do we align the company?’ ” The two days was only the start, as Gupta explains, “We’ve now done more work like that, where we help each other be better and become better as a team.” (Location 2144)

A common analogy is that managers are thermometers, and leaders are thermostats. Managers react to their environment, deal with the here and now, and measure and report results. Leaders influence their environment. They alter people’s beliefs and expectations. They cause action, they don’t just measure it. They are continually working toward a goal. When it comes to teamwork, the best CEOs are without question thermostats. (Location 2173)

To promote ever-increasing levels of teamwork, the best CEOs tend to four areas that most managers leave to others. First, they ensure that their team’s time is focused on the work that only it can do together. Second, they’re serious about the top team being every team member’s first team. Next, in top-level decision-making they stay in the triangle formed by data, dialogue, and speed. Finally, they invest regularly in team building, often using a facilitator or team coach to enable more rapid progress. (Location 2176)

The last aspect of the annual operating rhythm is a multiday off-site for the top team. Every July, for example, Dimon holds a four-day strategy off-site for the JPMC top team where he asks, “What are the most important questions facing the company?” The topics range from business expansion plans to technology strategies to HR policies to leadership training. They also discuss whether the operating rhythm is serving the company well. “What do we think is a waste of time, what is not; we really lay it all out on the table,” says Dimon. (Location 2258)

Conduct the Orchestra Along with connecting dots, the best CEOs also play the role of an orchestra conductor amid the day-to-day operating rhythm of the company. U.S. Bancorp’s Richard Davis explains the metaphor: “You go to a classical concert,” he says, “and if you arrive early, the orchestra is warming up. And it’s a very unpleasant noise because they’re all doing their own flourishes. Suddenly, they stop. And then out of stage right comes a human being holding nothing more than a stick who then stands and takes a bow for nothing they’ve done. Yet he or she puts his stick in the air, and beautiful music follows. At the end, the first applause is directed at the conductor who then acknowledges the performers. Not one time did the conductor actually play an instrument, but he or she earned respect from the orchestra for knowing when to have different instruments come in and play louder or softer.

Demand Disciplined Execution The best conductors listen closely to every note from every instrument, and if anything is out of time or out of tune, they act on it. Doing the equivalent as a CEO requires that a disciplined approach be taken to the meetings that determine the operating rhythm. (Location 2354)

For the best CEOs, a disciplined approach starts with having the right information beyond the high-level financials. JPMC’s Jamie Dimon explains, “There are commonalities to good leaders. It starts with a very basic thing, which is the discipline of analytics. I see people who just don’t do the basics right, who don’t understand the details on pricing, products, distribution, variable cost, and fixed cost. (Location 2359)

Some 2,500 years ago, Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War, “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory.

As we’ve seen, the best CEOs place heavy emphasis on solving for the team’s psychology and let the mechanics of coordination and execution follow. Below is a summary of how doing so translates into three main dimensions of mobilizing the leadership team—composition, effectiveness, and operating rhythm. As we shared at the beginning of this section, the rewards are tangible: With the right mindset and applying the related practices at this level, a company is twice as likely to achieve above-median financial performance.

Only 30 percent of board members report that they serve on boards whose processes are effective,51 and nearly half of executives observe that their board’s performance falls short.52 The best CEOs don’t tolerate these outcomes.

Baker sees it, “Getting on top of board dynamics is one of the real challenges for the CEO early on.

Delineate the Roles Conceptually, there’s rarely any disagreement on the role of the board in public companies.

Specify the Desired Profile In some ancient Greek city states, a council of elders was elected by voice vote of the people, with the winners determined by a group of men in a separate building who’d judge which shouts were the loudest without knowing which candidate received each shout.57 In modern-day governance in most legal systems, the process is less noisy but not dissimilar. The ultimate appointment and removal of directors is voted on by the shareholders. The board or a nominating subcommittee of the board selects candidates for the director’s job. Most important for CEOs, the board typically seeks input from management for such nominations. The best CEOs don’t wait to be asked—they actively assert what skills and experience are needed to help drive the business forward. (Location 2757)

Even when board members do understand the industry, they’re often looking in the rearview mirror, assuming that what was successful over the past twenty years will be the same in the next twenty, which is rarely true. To remedy these challenges, boards need to spend time educating themselves on what’s happening inside and outside the company. Excellent CEOs shape what this education should look like, and help the board add value to the business. (Location 2793)

A good orientation program for new board members can also be a powerful education tool. Establishing such not only grounds new board members in topics like changing technology, emerging risks, rising competitors, and shifting macroeconomic scenarios, but also provides a formal introduction to what it means to be an effective board member at the company by reinforcing the roles and expectations. While this may sound obvious, the fact of the matter is that only 33 percent of board members report they feel they received a “sufficient induction” when they took on the job. (Location 2817)

Encourage Renewal Given the importance of good governance, many find it surprising to hear that only 32 percent of directors report they regularly engage in formal evaluations of their performance, and a paltry 23 percent say their chair invites them to give feedback on whether a meeting was well run or not.60 Without such feedback, managing the performance of the board becomes challenging. A full 82 percent of executives think at least one member of their company’s board should be replaced, citing reasons such as diminishing performance due to advanced age, serving on too many boards, and reluctance to challenge management.

Like any team, a board is ideally made up of individuals with the right skills and will to win. Unlike most teams, however, the members of boards typically spend less than 10 percent of their time working together.62 The best CEOs not only work with their board chairs or lead directors to get the right people on the team—they also put the conditions in place for collective success by explicitly delineating the role of the board vis-à-vis management, specifying the board member profiles that will best help the business, proactively educating the group, and finding ways to encourage the board to continually renew itself.

Start with a Private Session When Feike Sijbesma took over DSM in 2007, there was a slot for “any other business” scheduled at the end of every board meeting’s agenda. He asked his chairman if that session could be moved to the beginning of the agenda instead. Some were confused and responded, “You want to talk about other business—everything that is left—before we even start with anything?” (Location 2883)

What are you most excited or concerned about?’ ” Sijbesma’s final request was, “Other than that, there should be no other formal structure for the discussion and no prepared presentation materials.

Let’s call it highlights and lowlights.” The rationale behind Sijbesma’s request was twofold. First, to be able to set the context for what the board would hear during the course of the board meeting so that they could orient themselves to the discussions to come in the most helpful ways. Second, to be able to put topics on the radar that weren’t yet ready for a decision and therefore not on the agenda. (Location 2883)

The private session is only a success if it’s radically transparent, as we described previously. One of the first things that Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Marc Casper did when he took the role was to start every board meeting with an executive session. “I focused on what I was worried about and the challenges we were facing,” he says. “My sole reason for that was to create a culture of transparency so that directors wouldn’t spend their time hunting for problems. We want them to do that, by the way, but we also want them to know that the management team’s true inclination is to bring problems to the board. That creates a totally different culture: You earn their trust and they hold you to a high standard. It elevates the dialogue and the impact.” (Location 2898)

“My biggest advice to CEOs is to start early with the attributes of what you believe will make a successful CEO when you’re gone,” he says. “Don’t be nervous about discussing that with the board. Take their feedback. It’s actually a way for you to get an appraisal of how you’re doing.” (Location 2944)
