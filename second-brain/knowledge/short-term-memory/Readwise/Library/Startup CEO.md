A CEO does only three things. Sets the overall vision and strategy of the company and communicates it to all stakeholders. Recruits, hires, and retains the very best talent for the company. Makes sure there is always enough cash in the bank.

While I generally agree that those three things are critical, it's impossible not to add a few other important topics to the list. First, I think you have to broaden the third topic. It's not just about making sure there's enough cash in the bank. It's about execution in general, so Part Three of this book is called “Execution” – both about having the money in the bank and about using it wisely through disciplined execution. Part Four covers a very unique aspect of the CEO's job: “Building and Leading a Board of Directors.” Part Five is more about the how of doing the job as opposed to the what: “Managing Yourself So You Can Manage Others.” I want to emphasize here that even though “Managing Yourself” is addressed in Part Five, you shouldn't wait to implement the practices and tips I outline until after you have gotten traction in your business model. By then it will be too late and all your time (and your sanity!) will be absorbed by the business. It's vitally important to build your business in ways that keep you refreshed, energized, and operating at peak personal performance. Part Five contains the tricks I have learned and the tools I use to bring the best of myself to both work activities and relationships outside of work, every day. Part Six, new in the second edition, speaks to the process of preparing for, executing, and recovering from, the sale of the company. This framework encompasses nearly every challenge a startup CEO has to face but it leaves out one crucial area: management and leadership. As a manager and a leader, I had a number of positive influence points over the course of my career and a number of negative influence points. I vowed to learn from those, both the good and the bad, and bring them with me to my job as CEO. In particular, some incredibly poor management practices I'd seen over the years motivated me to create a different kind of workplace.

Having a “say‐do” gap at the top of an organization is corrosive, leads to eye‐rolling and whispers of hypocrisy, and completely undermines your authority to lead the business.
