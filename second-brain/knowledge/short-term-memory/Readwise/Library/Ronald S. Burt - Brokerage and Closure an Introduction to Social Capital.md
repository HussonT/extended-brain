Thirty spokes meet in the hub. Where wheel isn’t is where it’s useful. Hollowed out, clay makes a pot. Where the pot’s not is where it’s useful. Cut doors and windows to make a room. Where the room isn’t, there’s room for you. So the profit in what is is in the use of what isn’t. Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, 500 bc (from Le Guin, 1997: 14 (Page 8)

Ask the leader of any large organization about the most difficult barriers he or she has to manage to harvest the coordination potential of our communication capabilities. They inevitably talk about people issues, culture issues. People continue to work the way they learned in legacy organizations, in yesterday’s organization silos. We are capable of coordinating across scattered (Page 17)

markets of human endeavor. We are not yet competent in how to take advantage of the capability. In this period of competence trying to catch up with capability, authority in the formal chain of command no longer provides the answers it once did. Matrix structures have people reporting to multiple superiors, which weakens the authority of each reporting relationship. Efficiencies gained by removing layers of bureaucracy shift control from vertical chains of authority to horizontal peer pressure. Work once defined by superiors in the formal organization is now negotiated between colleagues who have no authority over one another. People are more than ever the authors of their jobs, not told what to do, so much as expected to figure it out. Feeling that someone must be at fault, people blame one another for problems created by the capability–competence gap. I do not wish to make too much of the Fredericksburg analogy because it is only one of many such, but it is interesting to hear Fredericksburg soldiers voice complaints I so often hear in contemporary organizations: Officers in the field recognize the folly of attacking the Confederate line and so hope there is no truth to the rumor of headquarters ordering an attack. 2 Staff officers blame failure on a ‘‘want of cooperation’’ in the organization (Page 18)

When people are confused, they turn to friends and colleagues for advice. When authority is unclear, people turn to friends and colleagues for support. Accountability flows through the formal organization of authority relations. All else flows through the informal—advice, coordination, cooperation, friendship, gossip, knowledge, trust. Formal relations are about who is to blame. Informal (Page 18)

relations are about who gets it done. Informal relations have always been with us. They have always mattered. What is new is the range of activities in which they matter, and the emerging clarity we have about how they create advantage for certain people at the expense of others (Page 19)

The advantage created by a person’s location in a structure of relationships is known as social capital. Reflecting the coordination capability–competence gap bedeviling our time, social capital has become a core concept in business, political science, and sociology (Page 19)

Social capital is the contextual complement to human capital in explaining advantage. Social capital explains how people do better because they are somehow better connected with other people. Certain people are connected to certain others, trusting certain others, obligated to support certain others, dependent on exchange with certain others. One’s position in the structure of these exchanges can be an asset in its own right. That asset is social capital, in essence, a concept of location effects in differentiated markets (Page 19)

For example, Bourdieu is often quoted defining social capital as the resources that result from social structure (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992: 119, expanded from Bourdieu, 1980): ‘‘social capital is the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual or group by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.’’ James Coleman, another often-cited source, defined social capital as a function of social structure producing advantage (Coleman, 1988: S98, 1990: 302): (Page 19)

‘Social capital is defined by its function. It is not a single entity but a variety of different entities having two characteristics in common: They all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of individuals who are within the structure. Like other forms of capital, social capital is productive, making possible the achievement of certain ends that would not be attainable in its absence (Page 20)

capital has the potential to be a powerful technology applied to a critical issue. The technology is network analysis. The issue is performance. Social capital promises to yield new insights, and more rigorous and stable models, describing why certain people and organizations perform better than others. In the process, new light is shed on related concerns such as coordination, creativity, discrimination, entrepreneurship, leadership, learning, teamwork (Page 20)

In terms that will become clear across the chapters, here are the four stylized facts around which the book is organized: The first two facts describe the mechanism and returns to network brokerage, which is about the value of increasing variation in a group. Informal relations form a small world of dense clusters separated by structural holes (Figure 1.1). People whose networks bridge the holes are brokers rewarded for their integrative work, rewarded in the sense of more positive individual and team evaluations, compensation higher than peers, and faster promotion (Figure 1.8). Simply put, the first fact is that brokers do better.Second, improved vision is the mechanism responsible for returns to brokerage. Information is more homogeneous within groups such that people who bridge the holes between groups are at greater risk of having creative ideas and more likely to see a way to implement ideas (Figure 2.3) (Page 22)

The third and fourth facts describe the mechanism and returns to network closure, which is about the value of decreasing variation in a group. Closure increases the odds of a person being caught and punished for displaying belief or behavior inconsistent with preferences in the closed network. In so doing, closure reinforces the status quo. It protects against decay in new relations between friends of friends, and amplifies strong relations to extremes of trust and distrust (Figure 4.8 (Page 22)

Facilitating the trust and collaborative alignment needed to deliver the value of brokerage, closure is a complement to brokerage such that the two together define social capital in a general way in terms of closure within a group and brokerage beyond the group (Figure 3.5) (Page 22)

It is a cross-eyed strategy that focuses on contact volume. The focus on contact volume is reminiscent of the internet pre-bubble view of value in terms of ‘‘eyeballs’’ viewing a website—and it is just as wrong. 1 Counts of relationships will never measure network value, and in the worst case are associated with social pathologies. At best, a business model based on network size will be inefficient, typically dramatically (Page 26)

Here is why: The value of a relationship is not defined inside the relationship; it is defined by the social context around the relationship. Explaining that point, and the consequent inefficiency of optimizing for contact volume, is the substance of this chapter. Section 1.1 is about the association, in theory, between network and value. Section 1.2 describes the association as it occurs in an example organization; Sections 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 follow with corroborating evidence in other populations. I conclude in (Page 26)

The clusters in Figure 1.1 are associated with events that bring people together such as involvement in the same project, employment in the same firm or location, participation in the same church or school. The events create a ‘‘homophily’’ bias in networks, which means that relations are more likely between people who share socially significant attributes such as income, education, age, gender, and so on (also familiar in the old saying ‘‘birds of a feather flock together (Page 27)

Brokerage 13develop into friendship.Same-age friendships develop because students in the same classroom are typically the same age. Classrooms are a social focus for students. A similar story can be told for other potential foci such as occupations, income levels, geographic regions, industries, organizations, divisions, products, or teams. For example, Festinger, Schachter, and Back (1950) studied the friendships that developed among MIT students assigned to two-story dormitories. Friendships were most likely with students assigned to rooms at the foot of the stairs to the second floor.Foot-of-the-stairs students were more likely to bump into second-floor residents coming and going. The chance encounters led to recognition, greetings, casual conversation, and friendship. A relationship can be discontinued at any stage in its development to friendship, but it certainly won’t develop if it doesn’t begin. Time can be a social focus (Melbin, 1987). People who work in the same shift are more likely to develop friendships than people who work different shifts. People working different shifts are segregated in time. They have fewer opportunities for the random encounters that develop into friendships. The structure in Figure 1.1 is sometimes discussed as a ‘‘small world’’ structure because of a phenomenon that occurs in such structures. You meet a stranger at a social event and learn that you two have a mutual friend— ‘‘Isn’t it a small world!’’ There are social reasons why you and the stranger are attending the same event. It is not too surprising that you have mutual friends (which is Feld’s argument about social foci), but the point remains that we are often connected to people in other cities more strongly than we are to a colleague next door. Milgram (1967; Travers and Milgram, 1969) coined the term ‘‘small world’’ to describe the tendency for people at geographic remove to be connected through a few intermediaries. Granovetter (1973) drove the point home with respect to ‘‘weak ties’’ providing the key intermediaries and Watts (1998, 1999) rekindled interest in the small-world phenomenon (including illustrative descriptions of organization bridges and clusters, such as Kogut and Walker, 2001, on the small world of large German companies in the 1990s, treating two companies as connected when they are owned by one or more of the same institutional investors; Davis, Yoo, and Baker, 2003, on the small world of interlocking directorates among large U.S. companies in the 1990s; and Baum, Shipilov, and Rowley, 2003, on the small world of Canadian investment banking from the 1950s through the 1980s, treating two banks as connected if they participated in one or more underwriting syndicates together (Page 28)

Whatever the reasons for networks having the small-world structure illustrated in Figure 1.1, it is sufficient for the purposes here to say that such structures occur in a variety of circumstances and levels of analysis (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). Whether communities in a geographic region, divisions in a corporation, groups in a profession, or people in a team, people specialize within clusters and integrate via bridges across clusters.

Social history can be irrelevant to behavior. In a market, I buy from the seller with the most attractive offer. That seller may or may not be the seller I often see at the market, or the seller from whom I bought yesterday. So viewed, the network in Figure 1.1 would recur tomorrow only if buyers and sellers come together as they have in the past (Page 30)

Selecting the best exchange, however, requires that people have information on available goods, sellers, buyers, and prices. Even if information is of high quality, and eventually reaches everyone, diffusion requires channels and an interval of time (Page 30)

In other words, Figure 1.1 is an information Polynesia in which the clusters are islands of opinion and behavior. Information is not always different between the island clusters, but when information varies, variation will be more pronounced between clusters. 5 (Page 30)

Gaps between clusters in Figure 1.1 are holes in the structure of information flow, or more simply, structural holes. A structural hole between two groups need not mean that people in the groups are unaware of one another. It means only that the people are focused on their own activities such that they do not attend to the activities of people in the other group. Holes are buffers, like an insulator in an electric circuit. People on either side of a structural hole circulate in different flows of information. Structural holes are the empty spaces in social structure. The value-potential of structural holes is that they separate nonredundant (Page 31)

Variable exposure to structural holes is the foundation for network models of social capital and a fulcrum for comparing models. Recall that social capital refers to an advantage created by the way people are connected, then consider James and Robert in Figure 1.1. The two men have the same number of contacts, six strong ties and one weak tie, but different structures surround them (Page 31)

Robert is what early diffusion research identified as an opinion leader; a person responsible for the spread of new ideas and behaviors (discussed in Section 2.4). Robert’s more diverse contacts mean that he is more likely to be a candidate discussed for inclusion in new opportunities.More, there is a feedback loop to be expected: Robert’s experience with bridge relations is an asset in detecting and maintaining such relationships, and his early access to diverse information makes him more attractive to other people as a contact in their own networks (Page 32)

There is tension here, but not the hostility of combatants so much as the uncertainty of change. Robert lives in a world of contradictory variation. In the swirling mix of preferences across groups, value is created by network entrepreneurs strategically moving accurate, ambiguous, or distorted information between people on opposite sides of structural holes in the routine flow of information (Page 33)

I hire you to do a job and make four personal introductions to people whose support I believe you will need to do your job effectively (network A). You immediately take off, doubling the network to eight contacts (network B), soon quadrupling it to sixteen contacts (network C). What has happened to your information as you moved from network A, to B, to C? Has it increased, remained the same, or decreased (Page 34)

This illustrates the point of information redundancy and the importance of context for determining value. The value of a contact in terms of the information he or she provides depends on the information you already have. If a new person provides information that you already have, the new person adds coordination cost but no value (Page 34)

There are two network scalpels used to identify redundant sources. These are illustrated in the box that overlays the shaded area of Figure 1.2. The first network scalpel, cohesion, has been the focus up to this point: People strongly connected are likely to provide redundant information. Clusters A, B, C around James and Robert in Figure 1.1 are an example, as are the four clusters around you in the shaded area of Figure 1.2. The other network scalpel is structural equivalence. 10 The three contacts at the bottom of the box in Figure 1.2 do not talk to one another, but all three are strongly connected to the same source of information. Cluster D in the lower-left of Figure 1.1 is composed of people who have no direct contact with one another, but have in common ties to group (Page 35)

The three benefits of bridging structural holes can be expected: Access to alternative opinion and practice, early access to new opinion and practice, and an ability to move ideas between groups where there is advantage in doing so (Page 38)

the strength of a tie is a (probably linear) combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual confiding), and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie. (Page 39)

A bridge is a (strong or weak) relationship for which there is no effective indirect connection through third parties. In other words, a bridge is a relationship that spans a structural hole. There is a bridge relation in Figure 1.1 between Robert and contact 6. Robert has no relationship with anyone who is also connected to contact 6. Robert lives in cluster B. Contact 6 lives in cluster C. Their relationship is a bridge across the structural hole between clusters B (Page 39)

Relations can be measured for strength and context such that they can be sorted into three categories: bridges, bonds, and something else (more than a bridge and less than a bond) (Page 40)

The gist of my argument in this book is that bridges are valuable for creating information variation, while bonds are valuable for eliminating variation and protecting connected people from information inconsistent with what they already know (Page 40)

The contrast between bridges and bonds distinguishes two research strategies for estimating returns to brokerage. One strategy is to study returns to the people connected by brokers. The other is to study returns to the broker. Illustrating the first strategy, Garmaise and Moskowitz (2003) study the effects of brokers in the commercial real estate market: ‘‘Informal intermediaries fulfill a crucial function in markets in which borrowers seek financing relatively infrequently and have little opportunity to develop relationships with lenders themselves.... Hiring a broker raises the probability that a transaction will be financed with bank debt from 40% to a striking 58%.’’ The increase from 40% to 58% is a conservative estimate. Other estimates holding constant transaction differences associated with bank financing show an increase from 34% bank loans in nonbrokered transactions to 63% in brokered transactions (Garmaise and Moskowitz, 2003: 1024 (Page 40)

Problems arise if brokers are not clearly defined because the clear baseline of nonbrokered relations becomes ambiguous. Garmaise and Moskowitz have a code in their transaction data that distinguishes a broker present or absent. Such a code is rarely available. Coordination between two groups can come from various people connecting across the structural hole between the groups. There can be clear rules within groups of who is eligible to play the broker role, but there are no consistent rules across groups (Page 41)

Studies of social capital typically describe situations in which there is no binary variable distinguishing brokers. The strategy used to estimate returns to brokerage (and the strategy used in this chapter) is to distinguish networks by the extent to which they limit brokerage opportunities, then estimate the extent to which rewards accumulate disproportionately in the hands of people who have more opportunities for brokerage (Page 41)

There are three ways that network can be closed to brokerage. It can contain too few contacts, contacts too interconnected (Page 41)

There are three ways that network can be closed to brokerage. It can contain too few contacts, contacts too interconnected, or contacts too connected indirectly through a central person (Page 41)

The optimum network combines Robert’s brokerage reach with a closed, reputation-inducing, structure among select peers and subordinates. (Page 42)

The optimum network combines Robert’s brokerage reach with a closed, reputation-inducing, structure among select peers and subordinates.Second, the conclusion to optimize for structural holes is wrong-headed in assuming that Robert set out to create his brokerage position in Figure 1.1. Given the accumulating evidence of returns to brokerage, it is a short step to (Page 42)

about people strategically building bridges to increase their social capital. I use language to that effect in discussing Figure 1.2 with respect to managers building a network optimized for nonredundant contacts (Page 43)

In short, this chapter is about the instantaneous effect of brokerage: networks that span structural holes create an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities (Page 43)

Structural Holes around the Function The organization is rich in brokerage opportunities. The first set of opportunities concerned contacts missing from the network. Every person cited by three or more supply-chain managers is included in Figure (Page 45)

Structural Holes between the Business Units Second, there were structural holes between supply-chain organizations in separate business units. Checking company data on job rank and business (Page 45)

To see the level of connection across the business units, I focused on the most senior people to see the core of the supply-chain network, drawn in Figure 1.4. Managers are close together in Figure 1.4 to the extent that they cited one another and cited the same other people as discussion partners. Shaded areas indicate business units (Page 47)

The many opportunities for brokerage raise a question about incentives. If managers had incentives to coordinate across structural holes in and around the supply chain, why do so many holes still exist (Page 49)
