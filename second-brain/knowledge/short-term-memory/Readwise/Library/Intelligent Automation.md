For example, it used to take months to design and write automation scripts able to perform work. With the help of deep learning, we can now achieve this in hours. This enables automation programs to learn patterns and behaviors by themselves, without the need for a developer to write code. With that, we grow ever closer to IA being generated by technology (explained in Part Three of the book) involving incredible scalability.

IA, or “Intelligent Process Automation”, is a new notion, officially coined in 2017 by IEEE7. More recently, IA has been given different names, including Hyperautomation (by Gartner), Integrated Automation Platform (by Horses For Sources), and Cognitive Automation (by several sources).

The power of IA is such that it can meet most of the needs artificial intelligence or robotics can’t satisfy individually. The explanation is that IA combines not only the capabilities of both but also other complementary ones like sensing the environment or structuring workflows of information.

Credit card transaction fraud is a critical topic. It causes annual losses of some $28 billion9 and is a source of frustration for customers, retailers, and financial institutions. It is so prevalent that we believe it has happened at least once to most of our readers. As clients, we often blame our bank for not identifying these issues earlier and warning us. Also, even though losses tend to be insured, reimbursements take months. And before that, customers have to go through several administrative and inconvenient tasks, including filling in forms, providing evidence, and calling. Banks proactively monitor transactions to flag potential fraud; a typical high-level process is shown in Figure 0.1 ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=445))

Context: In 2019, to improve customer experience and limit its losses due to card fraud, a leading bank decided to leverage the latest technologies. It created a state-of-the-art machine learning-based program to identify fraudulent transactions automatically. The impact of this application was beneficial for the bank, which increased the volume of fraud resolved by 30% in less than four months. Nevertheless, while it improved the speed and completeness of the fraud identification process, the employees’ and clients’ experience worsened (see stage 1 in Table 0.1). ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=455))

Tags: #apply/experiment #insight/action #insight/framework #insight/principle #insight/statistic
Solution: To address this issue, the bank decided to take a more holistic approach. It requested support from a team in charge of IA at one of its subsidiaries. The first action from this team was to review and redesign not only the activity of fraud identification but also, more broadly, the end-to-end process with an emphasis on the customer and employee experience (see stage 2 in Table 0.1). While 20% of the process was automated with machine learning, the IA team succeeded in automating more than 80%. Outcome: As a result, the customer and employee experience drastically improved. Most of the tedious tasks were now performed by technology (see stage 3 in Table 0.1). Overall, the bank increased the number of fraudulent transactions solved by 70% and generated more than $100 million in additional savings per year.

The advantage of using IA has been to provide the capabilities to solve the problem holistically. It illustrates how the concept of IA has the power to create end-to-end touchless processes, cutting across an organization and delivering a broad range of benefits. We have summarized the key aspects of this transformation in Table 0.1 below. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=467))

IA ushers in a new revolution: that of office work, automating “white-collar” work. Today, office work accounts for more than 80% of the job roles in our global economy, such as lawyers, financial controllers, or call center operators.

These benefits are available to all organizations, across industries, and regardless of function. This book provides a comprehensive library of more than 500 IA use cases to illustrate our point (provided at the end of the book). In addition to being a key improvement lever, we also demonstrate that adopting IA has now become a condition for business survival.

IA automates knowledge work by mimicking four main capabilities of workers: execution, language, vision, and thinking & learning (see Figure 0.2). IA combines various technologies, including machine learning, sentiment analysis, data management platforms, speech analytics, data visualization, image and video analysis, biometrics, intelligent chatbots, smart workflows, low-code platforms, robotic process automation (RPA), and several more.

PART THREE explains how to succeed in implementing IA. While impactful, implementing IA is certainly not a silver bullet. While it is easy to succeed in implementing a pilot on a limited scope, many organizations have been struggling to scale their transformations. Based on our experience of hundreds of IA initiatives, we have listed in detail the most important factors to enable organizational leaders to succeed in their transformations. In addition to these leading practices, the book describes four new trends that have started to help businesses scale IA. They are also levers that any organization can use to increase the speed and scope of its IA projects. Examples include the democratization of IA, the convergence of technologies, the symbiosis of people and IA, and the use of IA to implement IA (see Figure 0.2). In the longer term, expected innovations will leverage new concepts, such as the internet of bodies, blockchain, augmented and virtual reality, and swarm robotics. The book explains what these cutting-edge technologies and concepts will bring to the automation of knowledge work.

Entering into the fourth industrial revolution with IA is not without risks. In our view, to prepare our world to effectively translate the key benefits of IA, our societies’ roadmap should include some imperatives. New skills are required for workers to stay relevant while working with IA. How are we going to make sure people’s skills stay relevant and evolve together with IA capabilities? In addition, according to economists, the use of digital technologies over the last decades has resulted in increasing wealth inequalities.

IA, also called Hyperautomation, is a concept leveraging a new generation of software-based automation. It combines methods and technologies to execute business processes automatically on behalf of knowledge workers. This automation is achieved by mimicking the capabilities that knowledge workers use in performing their work activities (e.g., language, vision, execution, and thinking & learning). The goal of using IA is to achieve a business outcome, through a redesigned automated process, with no or minimal human intervention. As a result, IA increases process speed, reduces costs, enhances compliance and quality, increases process resilience, and optimizes decision outcomes. Ultimately, it improves customer and employee satisfaction and boosts revenues.12 ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=551))

IA focuses on automating the work done by knowledge workers, whose principal capital is knowledge. Examples include programmers, physicians, pharmacists, architects, engineers, scientists, designers, public accountants, lawyers, and any other workers whose line of work requires them to “think for a living.” ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=557))

As opposed to manual labor, which is material-based (common in manufacturing industries), knowledge work is information-based and commonly found in service industries. Simply put, IA is the “white-collar” version of the “blue-collar” industrial automation, which started in the 19th century. For example, IA is used to support and augment the tasks performed by lawyers, financial controllers, or call center agents.

In the US, for example, industrial and farming automation only accounts for 17% of the potential impact of automation on workload. Intelligent automation (the “digital workers”) accounts for most of the rest (highlighted in red under “Services” in Table 0.2). Due to the large scope, the impact of IA in the coming years is expected to be significant for employment and society.

IA viewed in parallel with automation in agriculture Historically, agriculture was the first industry to be automated. The process of automating agriculture took over a thousand years. The outcome today is a thriving and highly efficient agribusiness. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=654))

As we can see from Figure 0.4, the level of automation has continued to increase, even since the 1990s. This is represented by the decline in the percentage of the global workforce working in this industry, falling from 44% in 1990 to 28% in 2017. Automation in agriculture has mainly been through the use of tractors, combine harvesters, milking machines, and hay press machines. In parallel, the share of undernourished people in the global population has also decreased from 19% to 11%. This evidences how automation was instrumental in reducing the proportion of the world population suffering from hunger. Thanks to automation, the agriculture industry has been able to increase its productivity continually, solving one of the most pressing world issues.

We expect IA’s impact to have even higher velocity and magnitude. Algorithms are to white-collar workers what tractors were to farmers: a tool to dramatically increase the productivity of each worker, and thus shrink the total number of workers required to produce the same output. But unlike tractors, algorithms can be shipped instantly around the world at no additional cost. Once an algorithm has been sent out to millions of users, it can be continuously updated and improved with no need to create a new physical product.

Artificial intelligence (AI): a combination of technologies able to reproduce human behavior and intelligence. It includes the capacity to sense the environment, analyze it, learn from it, and act on it. AI has applications in automating work (this is where it intersects with IA). However, unlike IA, AI also has applications in gaming, arts, education, and many other areas not connected to knowledge work. In addition, AI does not include the capability to execute actions or support workflows of tasks or data. Automation: the action of a software program or machine which performs tasks usually performed by human workers. In the case of IA, which is about knowledge work automation, we will mainly refer to software-based automation. Deep learning: a subfield of machine learning. It is a recent technology that enables machine learning to process complex data; for example, data that involves a large number of features and highly complex patterns, typically unstructured, such as pictures, movies, and language. This technology works on a similar basis to the structure and functions of a human brain. The deep learning model uses networks of neurons presented in superposed layers, with each layer performing a level of analysis of the input data (for example, to classify or recognize a pattern) and providing its output to the next layer. Digital workforce: a digital version of the workforce, which is otherwise usually composed of human workers. When using digital robots and programs to automate processes, companies create a digital workforce. As IA automates more and more processes, the size of the digital workforce grows. Machine learning: a subfield of artificial intelligence. It enables computers to learn and improve on their own, from experience, without being explicitly programmed. A machine learning algorithm can identify patterns in observed data (e.g., a growth trend in monthly sales revenue), build models that explain them (e.g., sales seem to be correlated to weather conditions), and predict future data (e.g., estimate future growth of sales considering the weather). Out of the different technologies used in the context of IA, machine learning has become the most used one. Robot: This term is commonly used to describe an automation program, independently of the technology used. In the context of IA, we mainly refer to software robots (non-physical robots, also called “digital robots”). A robot is a program in charge of automating a specific work task or process. For example, a chatbot is a robot able to dialogue with users on their computers or smartphones. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=677))

How has the nature of businesses evolved in recent years? To answer this point, we have started by selecting the largest companies out of the 2020 Fortune 500 list (i.e., companies with over 25,000 employees). The outcome was a list of 256 companies. We have then analyzed their profitability by comparing their profit per employee. Table 1.1 shows a ranking of companies with the highest profit per employee.

What does that mean? It signifies that the landscape of global companies is changing.

It may also mean that adapting legacy organizations to new digital technologies is not an easy process. The older and the more established enterprises are, the more complex it is. In our experience, this is most likely due to the inertia created by legacy and by the complexity and cost of change. It means digital natives – the most recent companies to arrive in the marketplace – hold the advantage as the pace of innovation accelerates. Another illustration is WhatsApp’s value. The company was acquired in 2014 for USD 19 billion (Facebook’s largest investment to date). WhatsApp was then a five-year-old company with only 50 employees. The 33-year average tenure of companies on the S&P 500 in 1965 narrowed to 20 years in 1990. And it is forecast to shrink to 14 years by 2026. About half of the S&P 500 will be replaced over the next ten years, according to Innosight.28 ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=732))

3.2. Ecosystems of data A data ecosystem is a set of actors working together in data and other shared resources. It is an interconnected set of services enabling users to fulfill a variety of needs in one integrated experience. Ecosystems act as gateways, offering customers a number of related services in a single interface. This avoids clients needing to switch between related services while lowering customer acquisition costs for the partners on the platform. In the banking industry, ecosystems can deliver customer-acquisition cost (CAC) savings of as much as 10 to 20 percent, according to McKinsey analysis.41 Ecosystems integrate data, which helps companies to monetize it by creating value-added services and enhancing customer experiences. For instance, a bank might leverage its users’ locations and spending trends to offer merchant-specific coupons or identify other opportunities for cross-selling products and services.

Enables quick decision-making • Provides tools and resources for them to do their job efficiently.46 We believe the recent COVID-19 crisis has reinforced this point. Organizations able to anticipate issues and support their people physically, mentally, and financially have become the new global references. Countries like Taiwan47 or companies like Apple48 have shown an exemplary response to the crisis. Both have focused their first efforts on anticipating the worst for their employees. They have then reacted by protecting the health and livelihood of their people. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=825))

Work is a key element in our lives. One-third of our life is spent at work, and the average person will spend 90,000 hours at work over a lifetime.49 Yet 85% of employees across the globe don’t feel engaged with their work. They often feel that it is too repetitive and not fulfilling. The number is higher in some countries than in others (70% in the USA versus 94% in Japan).50 ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=837))

Imagine spending the workday keying in invoices or reconciling data (perhaps you don’t have to imagine it). That is what millions of people across the globe do 8 to 10 hours per day – every workday. In 2018, there were 1.5 million bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerks – just in the United States. It gives a glimpse into how many people around the world, particularly in lower-cost countries (e.g., India, Philippines), focus their attention on these kinds of rule-based and repetitive tasks.51 IA offers to liberate employees from these tedious tasks by automating them, allowing people to refocus on more nuanced and value-adding activities.

We have identified three levers to enable the transition from the current breakdown of employee activities to the ideal division of activities. They are: • Automate: companies should identify and automate routine activities, such as generating a PowerPoint presentation for a weekly meeting or recording invoices in accounting software. • Augment: organizations should seize the opportunity to increase the value of work activities delivered by employees. IA is used as a crucial component here, with, for example, the generation of insights through advanced analytics to help decision making. • Abandon: some work activities do not fit with leading practices for efficient work, and represent an obstacle to the employee’s experience. These activities should be reduced or eliminated. For example, restricting the volume of meetings and email traffic is essential.

Provide employees with a personalized dashboard to monitor their work-life balance and healthy work habits. Platforms collect employees’ activity data (e.g., calendar and email activity) and analyze it to create the insight necessary to give directions and improve work behavior over time. Different types of platforms are readily available on the market, including: • Workplace collaboration analytics. These applications help with the collection of data from users’ collaboration activities (e.g., emails, meetings) to understand collaboration patterns and identify opportunities to improve work behavior. For example, they coach users in organizing efficient meetings with no more than four people, or in having at least one weekly talk with each of the team members.57 • Stress and mental health trackers. These tools monitor stress levels and mental health using sentiment analysis based on employees’ actions, interactions, and communications (e.g., emails, calls, instant messages). Some of these tools can also connect with smartwatches to collect additional data, such as heartbeats and activity levels. Some of these solutions also include an analysis of users’ facial expressions using computer vision.58 ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=895))

1. A responsive and omnichannel focus on customer service 1.1. Omnichannel Almost 90% of global customers think brands should provide an omnichannel experience. They should be able to switch between channels (e.g., phone, email, chat) and agents (different customer service staff) without losing context. Accomplishing this requires excellence in collecting all relevant information from customer complaints, support requests, and comments – then sharing them across all customer-facing touchpoints. For example, once Amazon customers report an issue, they do not have to repeat that information in other interactions.

Based on our experience, they can typically deal with 30–50% of live client interactions (e.g., calls, chats) relating to common or standard questions. In addition, they log queries or direct customers to the appropriate customer service representative for more information. Another growing trend leveraging IA is the use of self-service platforms, where users can solve their issues by themselves or with the help of other users. According to research, an increasing proportion of customers prefers them.68 And based on our experience, 50%… ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=959))

Losses due to errors The cost of errors is enormous: o Medical errors in the US incur an estimated economic value of almost USD 1 trillion78 – and 86% of those mistakes are administrative.79 o 80% of US medical billings contain at least minor mistakes – creating unnecessary annual healthcare spending of $68 billion.80 o The above estimates are for the US only; we could not find a global… ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1033))

In conclusion, the analysis in this section shows that IA has the potential to deliver total savings of approximately $10 trillion per year. This amount is the rough equivalent of the combined annual global expenditure for education and health. Of course, a benefit of this magnitude won’t take place over just 5 to 10 years. It will likely require 10–20 years. Now let us imagine we can reach 50% of these savings in the coming ten years and that they can be redeployed through regulation, taxation, or other mechanisms. The $5 trillion losses saved by IA could mean that, in practical terms, thanks to higher adoption of IA: • Global budgets allocated to education could be more than doubled.82 • Or, global healthcare budgets… ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1047))

1. Preventing deaths from non-communicable diseases through research Non-communicable, chronic, long-term diseases cause more than 70% of deaths. These diseases are not passed from person to person and typically progress slowly. The largest killer in this category, responsible for one-third of all deaths, is cardiovascular disease, which affects the heart and arteries. Cancer is the second largest cause of death. It is followed by diabetes and several respiratory diseases. Beyond the non-communicable factor, a common denominator to these diseases is the essential resource needed to find a cure: research. IA’s ability to assist with documentation and checks of research means it can play a crucial role in clinical trials.

For example, acute kidney injury (AKI) is responsible for an estimated two million deaths per year globally, according to the University of Pittsburgh.89 AKI is challenging to diagnose because it exhibits a number of various symptoms, including abnormal blood pressure or blood volume. As a result, AKI is typically spotted only when it has reached a late stage. At that time, irreversible damage has occurred and the condition is either fatal or requires long-term dialysis.

Using IA, DeepMind’s new approach uses a deep learning algorithm trained on the anonymized data of 700,000 patients (e.g., demographics, health records, test data). This program can identify AKI two days earlier than the standard approach, using an app called STREAMS. It sends easy-to-read results and graphs directly to clinicians.90 These capabilities provide the patient and their doctor with more time for critical treatment interventions.

Improving the resilience of our world to pandemics and crises has become crucial. Let us take the example of the coronavirus crisis, also called the COVID-19 crisis. In our view, this crisis evidenced the need for more resilient systems to support our society. Our health and economic systems, mainly managed by a human workforce, have been put under extreme stress. Hospitals were desperately in need, while economies were falling into downturns.

1. Missing cash During the crisis, many businesses and customers faced cash flow issues; cash flow management became more vital than ever. If a business was unable to collect its accounts receivable on time, its cash flow was significantly impacted. For many companies, the collection and application of cash was a manual task, and the lack of digitization and automation of cash processes caused the failure of millions of companies around the world. Only organizations that automated key parts of their accounts receivable processes were able to lessen the impact. For example, based on our own experience, automating the cash allocation process allowed a major manufacturing company based in Korea to survive. It decreased the number of outstanding invoices by more than 50% (a few hundreds of millions of dollars) in less than three weeks.

2. Discontinued operations Service operations and corporate functions (e.g., logistics, human resources, customer services) were also strongly impacted. Providing access and connectivity to systems and hardware, and managing their performance remotely, has been challenging for many organizations. A famous hospital in Italy faced pressing issues due to the lack of automation of its physicians’ work scheduling process. This had an impact on its capacity to accept new patients and save more lives. The crisis was a catalyst to provide access to systems to most employees and customers remotely and securely. Winning organizations have been the ones that digitalized end-to-end journeys at the onset and converted paper-based data into digital information at the source.

3. Missed revenues and dissatisfied customers Several organizations, especially in retail, have been forced to discontinue some lines of business or close storefronts. Many were not digitalized and not accessible to clients online. When physical branches and stores closed, millions of customers around the world were confronted with the absence of service availability and the inability to connect with their usual providers. This was equally applicable to organizations in the business-to-business space where order intake and order management was often handled manually. At the same time, their digitally enabled competitors were able to leverage this opportunity. They sustained or even increased their revenue while they grew their market share.

This impacted employees’ motivation, efficiency, and work-life balance, created stress, and sometimes even affected their physical and mental health. Leading companies were able to provide their employees with safety, connectivity, and remote work tools. They leveraged analytics to support process transparency and remote monitoring of the work executed. They also utilized downtime to initiate re-skilling and training on key topics, including future skills such as robotic process automation and analytics. Organizations that invested in reskilling employees to manage automated processes were typically able to recover more quickly.

Even though IA emerged less than ten years ago, its potential has already been proven in global companies like JP Morgan, Unilever, and Netflix. IA has the potential to increase an organization’s efficiency by 20–60%. IA’s impact is compelling, targeting both top (e.g., through enhanced customer experience) and bottom lines (e.g., by enabling higher efficiencies). • We demonstrate that IA has become a business imperative. Adapting legacy organizations to new digital technologies is difficult for older, more established enterprises. This is most likely due to the cost of change and to the complexity of managing change. For this reason, about half of the S&P 500 is likely to be replaced over the next ten years. To help our readers rethink their businesses, we present two recent impactful transformation concepts leveraging IA: new digital business building and data ecosystem platforms. In addition, the first companies to adopt IA can generate benefits before their competitors. It provides them with a competitive advantage, resulting in higher market share and in the capacity to save money that can be reinvested in further IA transformations and service innovation. These compelling benefits are available to all organizations across industries and functions. The reader is provided with a compelling library of IA use cases to support this assertion and enable further study (refer to “Asset: IA use cases library” at the end of the book).

We present how IA can improve the employee experience. IA helps to take away the most mundane work activities, and it helps to augment employee capabilities. As a result, IA improves employee engagement and creates a healthier workplace and work-life balance while boosting employee performance. To support this objective, companies can leverage IA to analyze the work activities performed by their employees and use three levers to improve them. They can either augment (increase the value of work activities delivered by employees), automate or abandon work activities (e.g., inefficient work practices such as abundant emails). We call this approach the “Triple-A artifact”, and we explain how IA… ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1208))

IA has substantial benefits to bring to our society at large, especially in healthcare and education. We demonstrate that IA has the potential to save 10+ million lives by avoiding early deaths. It supports clinical trials and disease diagnosis, avoids medical errors, and reduces deaths from preventable causes, especially in developing countries. In addition, IA can avoid $10 trillion of losses every year (e.g., by reducing fraud, errors, and work-related diseases and accidents).

Description and applications This capability allows computers to perceive, interpret, and understand elements of the visual world, like environments, objects, signs, or letters. In the context of IA, it mainly enables the processing of documents, images, videos, and biometric information. For example, it helps to automate the processing of invoices or to identify anomalies, such as signs of diseases on medical images. Key technologies The overarching technology is called computer vision (CV). While it used to be coded as a set of rules, computer vision is nowadays mainly enabled by deep learning techniques. In the context of IA, the four key technologies presently using computer vision are optical character recognition (OCR), intelligent character recognition (ICR), image and video analysis, and biometrics. We show how they bring value in document capture and processing, generating insights from images and videos, and identifying identities. 1. Optical character recognition (OCR) 1.1.

1.2. OCR OCR has been used for the last two decades for this purpose. The limits of using OCR as a standalone technology to capture and process documents is its inability to manage unstructured documents. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1272))

This means documents that are not presented using exactly the same standards and layout (e.g., invoices that are different from one vendor to another) won’t be processed accurately by OCR. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1274))

Also called intelligent data capture or intelligent document processing, ICR combines the use of OCR to digitize documents, natural language processing to extract and interpret information (refer to “Capability 3: Language”), and machine learning for pattern recognition (refer to “Capability 4: Thinking & learning”). This technology unlocks the capacity for IA to manage and process scanned images or documents ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1280))

ICR helped to automate the processing of 400,000 invoices annually Context: A manufacturing company used to receive over 400,000 invoices per annum from more than 500 suppliers. It used to have 29 people keying in these invoices all day – a highly mundane task. This invoice data capture is a complex process to automate because invoices are unstructured data. All invoices contain largely the same information, but depending on the vendor, the layout is different. For example, all invoices present a price, a date, and a vendor name. But this information is rarely displayed the same way. For example, the vendor’s name might be displayed at the top or bottom of the page, while the dates might use different formats. Hence, there is a need for a more intelligent technology than a standard OCR application. Solution: Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology is a solution that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize the characters on a scanned document or image, natural language processing (NLP) to understand the words and their meaning, and machine learning to identify patterns and learn over time. This technology has been on the market for five years and is continuously improving. Outcome: Using this solution, this company was able to reduce the invoice capture workload by more than 70% in about four months. As a result, the 29-person team was redeployed. Specifically, six people were upskilled to manage the redesigned process. However, their role changed completely from repetitively keying in invoices to training the IA system, performing quality checks, and handling exceptions. Twenty-one people were retrained to assume roles in other departments and worked on more interesting and value-add tasks such as business performance commentaries, insights, and analysis. Finally, two employees were retrained to work in the transformation team in charge of deploying similar transformations to other processes. 3.

Image and video analysis Image and video analysis is the extraction of meaningful information from digital images. It is used to generate insights that can be leveraged in triggering automated actions (e.g., decisions, alarms, actions). It includes both static images and videos. Key benefits include processing speed and accuracy, providing the capacity to process an enormous amount of images and videos in a short time. The range of applications is broad, across several industries, including medical image diagnosis, retail store automation, business processes documentation, and autonomous vehicles.

Such activities include typing text, clicking on buttons, routing information, filling in forms, and authenticating users. Typical automated processes involve logging in and out of systems, compiling data and preparing reports, reconciling data, sending emails, enabling interfaces between systems, and performing spreadsheet analyses. This capability is a foundation for end-to-end automated business process delivery. It acts as a glue, connecting the technologies across capabilities. For example, it can support the collection of data through vision or language capabilities (e.g., a historical report on swimsuit sales).

Low-code platforms allow anyone in a company to create applications without specific coding skills. For example, they enable any user to create interfaces between systems and workflows, such as forms to collect data, reports, and approval processes.

Let us take, for example, the claims process for an insurance company. For this process, the platform allows the insurance company’s client to record their claims online. The claims are then routed, through the platform, for approval to the program in charge of checking their eligibility. Based on the outcome, the claim may be automatically settled. If it is not, an email is automatically sent by the platform to the client to explain the reason for the rejection. If there is any issue in the process, another email is sent to an employee to resolve it. Finally, these platforms include some analytics functionalities. They allow analysis of the performance of the process and the time taken by each step, and the identification of areas of improvement.

Indeed, they enable rapid, highly accurate processing.

RPA helps to produce two types of automation: assisted (also called attended) and unassisted (or unattended) automation. Assisted automation (also referred to as “robotic desktop automation”, or RDA) runs on people’s desktops and executes actions hand-in-hand with the employee. For example, from our experience, any call center agent needs to open 5 to 8 different applications when serving a client during a call. Opening these applications and looking for the name of the client in each of them takes 10 to 20% of the total time of a call. RDA helps to pre-open these applications at the right screen. When the call is finished, another time-consuming activity for the agent is to document the… ([Location 1428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1428))

Configuring RPA programs is quite user-friendly. It usually requires a few weeks of training for a business user to master most of the functionalities. In addition, most tools will involve a process task recorder to increase the speed of development. After the user presses a button, the program records the tasks performed by the user on the computer, and it uses this recording to precode the robot. This will help to generate about 10 to 40% of the code automatically. The cost of an RPA license is quite low (from free to $8,000 per year). For these reasons, RPA was heavily hyped in the years from 2015 to 2019. Attracted by the promise of low-hanging fruit, companies rushed to implement these programs.

These technologies can be used interchangeably. The leading practice is to use smart workflow and low-code platforms as a foundation of the overall automation platform. RPA is used when IA needs to be integrated with legacy systems or automation of bespoke processes. Here is the explanation: ([Location 1450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1450))

Tags: #apply/habit #insight/action #insight/framework #insight/statistic
For a well-defined, standard, and stable process involving hand-offs between people and systems, it is preferable to use a smart workflow platform. Such platforms offer pre-developed modules. These are ready-to-use automation programs customized by industry and by business function (e.g., onboarding of clients in retail banking). In addition, they are modular. For example, a module might include a form for client data collection, and another module might support an approval workflow. In addition, these modules can be linked to external systems and databases using connectors, such as application programming interfaces (APIs), which enable resilient data connectivity. Hence, with smart workflows, there is no need to develop bespoke internal and external data bridges. This integration creates a system with high resiliency and integrity. In addition, the standardization by industry and function of these platforms, combined with the low-code functionality, helps to accelerate the implementation.

Tags: #apply/experiment #insight/action #insight/framework
There are no ready-to-use modules with RPA. Most of the development is bespoke, and all process flows need to be built almost from scratch. The connections also need to be constructed. This results in a more flexible design and implementation of the programs developed, which can fit with more specific business requirements. The key advantage of RPA is that it allows the creation of automation programs that can involve legacy systems (e.g., those which can’t use APIs) or address non-standard requirements (e.g., onboarding of clients for a broker insurance company under Singapore regulations). However, with RPA, the lack of native integration amongst the components has weaknesses. For example, it involves less robustness, weaker data integrity, and lower resilience to process changes. If one part of an RPA program fails, the whole end-to-end process is stopped. ([Location 1460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1460))

Description and applications This capability gives machines the ability to read, speak, write, interact, interpret, and derive meaning from human language. In the context of IA, it mainly concerns language interactions with employees, clients, suppliers, and partners through diverse channels, including phone, messaging, and interactions with smart devices. Key functionalities include text translation, information extraction, information summary, information categorization (e.g., spam filters), sentiment analysis, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, predictive text typing, or voice understanding. For example, machine translation helps to overcome barriers due to foreign languages. Google Translate is used by 500 million people every day to understand more than 100 world languages.

Key technologies The overarching technology is called natural language processing (NLP). While NLP is theoretically focused on the processing of language when received (i.e., read or interpreted), natural language generation (NLG) is the expression of a language in the form text or speech. To simplify our presentation, and as commonly accepted in the IA community, we will use NLP, by default, to describe the concept of both processing and generation of language. While NLP used to be coded as a set of rules, it is nowadays mainly enabled by deep learning techniques. Large amounts of labeled data help the system identify relevant correlations between words and sentences. Language is broken down into shorter elemental pieces to teach the machine to understand their relationships. By doing this, the computer can ascertain the meaning behind a sentence. In the context of IA, the key four technologies presently using NLP are intelligent chatbots, unstructured information management, sentiment analysis, and speech analytics. 1.

Intelligent chatbots119 Chatbots have been around since 1966. But over the last decade, machine learning and especially deep learning technology have propelled their capabilities to an entirely new level. ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1490))

By 2023, the number of chatbots is anticipated to surpass the number of humans in the world.120 As proof of the speed of technological progress, chatbot technology has, in a very few years, become so capable that it can be easily confused with humans. The more advanced chat technology can seamlessly use several communication channels such as messaging (e.g., Slack, Facebook), SMS, text, and voice (e.g., voice-based assistants such as Siri, Alexa).

The most advanced type of chatbot is called a “cognitive agent”. On top of the standard chatbot capabilities described above, cognitive agents include the ability to learn from conversations between people, execute actions (like processing changes in systems), and improve themselves over time. In addition, they can observe people’s reactions using a webcam, recognize sentiments, and adjust their behavior accordingly. Each conversation can be captured, analyzed, and aggregated to deliver real-time insights. ([Location 1500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1500))

typical interaction between a human and a cognitive agent using natural language processing is sequenced as follows: 1. A human talks to the cognitive agent; 2. A sensor (e.g., microphone) captures the audio; 3. The speech is converted into text using speech-to-text transcription; 4. The text is processed as data to create an outcome (e.g., build a reply, insight, or prediction); 5. The outcome is generated in the form of text; 6. The text is converted into speech using a text-to-speech transcription, enabling the machine to respond to the human in spoken language.

It is able to help onboard new clients and guide them through the bank’s main services. It answers their questions and acts for them (for example, it can order a new credit card).122 Another example, presented in Figure 2.8, is the project “Digital Healthcare for Tomorrow”. Dr. Lance O’Sullivan, a public health advocate and founder of iMoko, developed a solution for delivering more care to more patients at lower costs, in the form of a digital healthcare assistant. We recommend you watch the video provided in the footnotes section.123 Another well-known case is from the Swedish appliance company SEB. It uses a cognitive agent for both its IT help desk (supporting 15,000 employees) and its customer service department (supporting 1 million customers).

A cognitive agent helped to improve client satisfaction while reducing employee turnover significantly Context. A hotel chain needed to manage more than 20,000 client interactions per day through emails, calls, messages, and social media. This workload used to be managed by a team of 240 customer care agents servicing clients 24/7, mainly supporting sales, room reservations, inquiries, and after-sales. This team was facing low employee morale and high employee attrition, with an annual turnover of 40%. The low morale was mainly due to high and uneven workload, work pressure, and long shifts. These problems resulted in low service quality, rated less than 5 out of 10 by the chain’s customers. In order to solve this situation, the hotel chain decided to launch a digital transformation effort, including the implementation of a cognitive agent. Solution. The company built a cognitive agent able to dialogue consistently across channels (e.g., emails, messaging, voice, and social media). This technology was also able to learn from observing conversations between people and to improve itself over time (using machine learning). It could execute actions (like processing changes in systems) and recognize users using their voice or face (using biometrics). It could also understand emotions by watching users through webcams. Its look and behavior were designed to be very similar to those of human agents. This increased acceptance of the cognitive agent by clients and improved their personal connection with it. Outcomes. After a 3-month transformation project, the hotel chain was able to enjoy the following improvements: - Client satisfaction score increased from 5/10 to 9/10, with improved reactivity and quality; - Employee morale improved… ([Location 1530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1530))

Also known as customer engagement analytics or interaction analytics, speech analytics combines the capabilities of UIM platforms and sentiment analysis platforms. It is often specifically designed for call centers. Speech analytics can capture conversations held via phone, email, text, webchat, and social media. The system transcribes all discussions using speech-to-text and turns them into searchable, structured data that machine learning can then use to gain insight into what customers feel or think. The data is analyzed in real time by a sentiment analysis algorithm. This insight can be put into action by providing direct feedback to supervisors and agents through visual cues, notifications, and reports. If the client sentiment proves to be critically negative, it also offers alerts to managers so that they can intervene promptly. It helps to improve the efficiency of customer relationships, call agent performance, compliance adherence, and revenue generation, and enhance the customer experience. It supports the identification of patterns leading to successful sales. For example, it can help identify that, for a certain product, when a client talks positively about a competitor, giving him a $100 voucher triggers a sale in 70% of cases.

2.3. Clustering It can be defined as the task of identifying subgroups in the data such that data points in the same subgroup (cluster) are as similar as possible and are as different as possible to other clusters. In other words, it is about finding homogeneous subgroups within the data. Some uses of clustering algorithms include network traffic classification, document categorization, gene clustering, or product categorization. For example, clustering is used in market segmentation, where we try to segment a client base into homogeneous groups to customize offers to them.

2.4. Deep learning Deep learning algorithms are inspired by how the human brain works. They are more powerful than other machine learning algorithms because they are made of numerous layers, each providing a different interpretation of the data analyzed. Deep learning techniques are used when data features are numerous and there is a lack of domain understanding to identify and understand them. This data is typically complex, such as images, videos, or voice recordings. For example, an image contains an indefinite amount of data features (e.g., points, edges, shapes, or objects), and some are relevant to the problem… ([Location 1700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1700))

The market for machine learning platforms is large and fragmented; therefore, it seemed essential to us to guide the reader into it. This market is composed of three types of products: open-source, traditional, and cloud-only platforms. The latter two are also called commercial platforms. Open-source platforms (e.g., Scikit Learn, Keras, PyTorch or R-Project) are freely available and may be redistributed and modified. Communities support the code. As these platforms are broadly used, it might be easier to hire talents with the required skills to use them. They are well-suited for… ([Location 1712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KFLY51Y&location=1712))

Examples of end-to-end processes include Purchase-to-Pay (i.e., the process from purchasing products or services through to paying the vendors for them), or Order-to-Cash (i.e., from the reception of the order from the client until reception of the cash). Case illustration 2.3 demonstrates how a bank onboarding process has been automated by combining IA capabilities. For recommendations on the implementation of such integrated solutions, see “Critical success factors in implementing IA” in Part Three of the book.

Combining IA capabilities to power a bank’s client onboarding process Context: The main objective of this banking process is to collect and assess future client data to provide better service and manage risk. In the past, this process was mostly manual, and hence, it was long and painful for clients and employees alike. It included the following process activities: (1) Manually collecting, checking, and keying in client ID documents, electricity bills, rental contracts, and other documents that prove the identity and address of a potential client. (2) Checking the future client’s data against government databases and other references. (3) Assessing the risk of fraud and insolvency, mainly using static external sources. (4) Guiding the future client and answering questions during office hours. Automating such an end-to-end process was not an easy task as it combines a wide range of capabilities, including executing, reading, dialoguing, understanding, analyzing, and learning. Unfortunately, there is no one single technology that is able to master all these capabilities. The only way to optimally automate this process was to integrate different technologies. Description of the new solution: Chatbots helped to welcome prospective clients 24/7 and answer their questions. Application programming interfaces (APIs) allowed the sharing of data between the government regulator and the bank, and the collection of client information from other sources such as Google and Facebook. Analytics and machine learning estimated and continuously updated the risk levels and segmented the client pool to customize services. Computer vision and natural language processing helped to intelligently process unstructured documents such as bills, contracts, and identity documents. Robotic process automation supported the execution of the overall process, performing all rule-based activities such as reconciling data, checking data, and sending emails. An example of such a redesigned process is shown in Figure 2.13. Outcome: This end-to-end process automation resulted in a reduction of process time by over 90%, a cost reduction of over 80%, enhanced compliance, and a significantly improved customer experience. At the overall bank level and after implementing 12 similar end-to-end processes over an 18-month period, the bank saw its total costs reduce by 15–20%, and its revenues increase by 10%.

Success is easy when implementing IA within limited scopes, through proofs-of-concept or pilots. However, scaling up the initiative across an organization introduces another level of complexity. The scaling-up phase is the most critical step to create momentum, generate the expected benefits, create economies of scale, and, most importantly, sustain the change. Examples of companies that have notably succeeded in their transformations at scale include Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan Chase, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, and Amazon.
