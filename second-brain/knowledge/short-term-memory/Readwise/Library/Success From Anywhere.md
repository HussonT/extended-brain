“This is the real secret of life – to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.” —Alan Watts, British philosopher “My work is a game. A very serious game.” (Location 136)

The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his [or her] work and his play, labor and leisure, mind and body, information and recreation, love and religion. [S]he hardly knows which is which. [S]he simply pursues a vision of excellence at whatever is being done, leaving others to decide whether it is working or playing. To the master, it is always both. —James Michener, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Tales of the South Pacific and 40 other books (Location 216)

powerful realization struck me. My long-standing belief was that a game is an experience to execute. Designed by someone else, with a fixed set of rules, and resulting in one winner. Unlike my game-time focus on execution, Fitch saw a game as an experience to create. Designed with all possible players in mind, with a flexible set of rules, and room for everybody to play.

Ever the entrepreneur, Fitch saw an opportunity to create a new game of life. A game designed on a simple yet profound premise: Every player wants to win. Every player has the ability (the potential) to win. Every player must have equal opportunity to win. Every player is welcome in the game, and you don't have to “bet it all” (or lose everything) in order to play. Five-year-old Fitch saw what we often miss: And everyone can be successful by design.

But freedom is a state of mind, not a set of rules. Rules always exist; take the law of gravity, for example. But Success from Anywhere isn't a rulebook. It's a tool kit. To help you play by your own rules. (Location 246)

I've experienced what it's like to feel trapped inside an organization. Working for a horrible boss. Unsupported by colleagues. Blocked by rules and fools, wondering where I lost my tools. Wondering why success was just a far-off concept, reserved for other players (not me). Making my own masterpiece wasn't something I could internalize – or act on. Lost and afraid in a game I never made – yes, I know the feeling! But I discovered a new way to play – and you can, too. You don't have to quit your job, destroy your mobile phone, or move into the woods in order to find new possibilities. You don't have to escape in order to create; you simply have to change your relationship to the game you're playing. (Location 262)

a player comes to her coach and says, “Coach, there's only one way to win! I'm trapped and I can only make it to the goal via this one way!” the coach would reply by sitting her down on the bench for an attitude adjustment. Because there's never just one way to win. (Location 273)

Three simple steps can help you to choose differently. Define: What's the game you're playing right now? What does the “game of life” look like for you? How are you showing up, when it's game time? Design: What new rules could you create for yourself? What old rules need to change? What plays could you run that you haven't considered before? What's that new design that would transform everything? Deliver: Results come from action. What needs to be done, in order to raise your game? What's one thing you can commit to, right now, to get you closer to the game you want to play? Creative solutions are always available. Commit to finding them, right now, and you're on your way to delivering a new level of success. (Location 307)

Our values form the foundation of the future of work. Creating the Success from Anywhere blueprint means we have to have the courage to pull back the things that don't matter. Maybe even removing the pretty things that we've invested in, the niceties and the elegant facades that aren't serving us. They are hiding the cracks from us. How much have you settled? What is it going to take to strengthen and to reinforce your foundation, so that your career (and your company) can create a solid foundation, not just a beautiful curb appeal for the marketplace?

So I did. And here's what I discovered: Permission is the path to possibility. Two words that invite fun into my world: “Why not?” Taking my four-year-old self to tap dancing has healed my soul. Being good or bad at something doesn't matter when you see the joy inside of an experience. (Location 412)

When something feels out of alignment, I ask myself: How did I/we get here? How do I feel when I am here? (In this body. In this relationship. In this workplace. In this space. In this life.) I notice my experience. How do I want to feel? (Healthy. Well. Successful. Happy. Joyful. Safe. Calm. Purposeful. Loved. Accepted. Seen. Heard.) It's possible to feel low and still perform high (I made President's Club the year I went through a divorce, for example). Success won't make you happy but being happy makes it easier to find success. Is it possible to feel that way – to feel and to be at my best – in a sustainable way in my current circumstance/context? (I created a vision for myself that says, “Honoring myself, I sustain radiant wellness.” And I filter choices through whether they will honor me, sustain me, be sustainable, and contribute to my well-being.) If yes, awesome! If not, what other choices might be available? (Create choices. Even if I don't love all the choices. Even if it feels the choices are big/scary/difficult, you might need to try a different dance class!) If it looks like there's only one choice – one way to play the game – chances are you are experiencing a misunderstanding. Other choices are always around; we just have to know where to look, and be willing to play, full out, when we discover them. How would I feel if I operated from the belief that I have both the permission and the freedom to choose differently? (Maybe scared. Maybe uncertain. And also free. Perhaps even … empowered?) Look at your foundation, even if you have to pull back a few layers to really see it. How could I feel more confident about making a different choice? (Support from others? New resources? New wisdom/leaders/guides? Remember, a Google search or YouTube video is rarely a good substitute for a powerful conversation. Who could you connect with, right now, to explore different choices?) What would it take for me to commit to choose differently? (It wasn't easy to watch eight-year-olds who could tap dance better than me! But it's funny how we are all on different paths and different journeys. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I see now that it's just a thing! I had to confront shame. When I did, when I really looked at where that experience was coming from, I saw it for what it was: just a thought!) What's the smallest step I could give myself permission to take/to make this choice? Or to progress toward my transformation? How would I reward myself for progress? From there, I could look at my situation in a new way. I could forgive myself for previous choices that got me to a place (or kept me in a place) that no longer served me. After all, I was just doing the best I could at the time – and aren't we all? How I show up is my choice, not determined by anything other than how I choose to play the game. One small step at a time. (Location 468)

Do you value the outcome in a way that makes the effort worth the impact? When we remember who we are, and what we want, the ability to take action increases. And so do our results. When Dee made a decision to get a second opinion, the game changed. When she decided to do what was needed, she was playing at a different level. She moved from intention to action. She uncovered her own personal commitment in the process. (Location 500)

In describing what they call the “Psychology of Self-Defense: Self-Affirmation Theory” (https://bit.ly/sfa-psych2), psychologists Sherman and Cohen write, “When self-affirmed, individuals feel as though the task of proving their worth, both to themselves and to others, is ‘settled.’ As a consequence, they can focus on other salient [meaningful] demands in the situation beyond ego protection.” In other words, connecting with your values helps you to move past your ego and find new solutions, by reducing defensiveness. Welcome to a scientific way to get out of your own way. (Location 542)

There's a name for putting up with stuff that doesn't serve us. It's called progressive tolerance. (Location 785)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/progressive-tolerance #domain/psychology #insight/definition
  
CHARACTERISTICS OF PROGRESSIVE TOLERANCE Tolerating experiences that are out of alignment with our values. Saying, “It's not that bad.” Saying, “Maybe it will go away,” or “This situation will fix itself.” A mindset that says, “I have no choices. I have limits. I am trapped.” Or perhaps, “It's not mine to fix,” or “You can't fight city hall.” Look for signs of resignation. Looking the other way. A pattern of repeated fear. Shame. Regrets. A lost opportunity that you just can't seem to embrace, even when it shows up more than once. Examples of progressive tolerance: Knowing that this is not where you want to be or how you want to feel, your friends/co-workers are telling you that something is amiss but you keep ignoring it, you see suffering and say/do nothing (especially if you are the one feeling the pain), you experience pain with no gain (others benefit from your sacrifice). You become numb, unaware of choices and options. (Location 821)

We need to move from progressive tolerance to progressive consciousness. (Location 841)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/progressive-consciousness #domain/psychology #insight/key-point
Tags: #insight/key-point
Tags: #insight/key-point
  
CHARACTERISTICS OF PROGRESSIVE CONSCIOUSNESS At its deepest level, consciousness contains truth, beauty, creativity, and love. It is the place of awareness, where we recognize the good inside all of us. Our humanity resides there. Our human consciousness is what separates us from the animals, allowing us to be aware of ourselves and others, so that we can work and live humanely. Progressive consciousness bravely asks, “What's not working? Why?” Progressive consciousness leads us to speak up, speak out, and show up. For ourselves, and for those we see suffering in the loop of progressive tolerance. Progressive consciousness prompts the question “Could there be a better way?” Progressive consciousness reminds us of self-care: bringing new awareness around the fact that you are worthy, deserving, and abundant. Progress is always possible – and sometimes letting go is the greatest progress you can make. Looking squarely at the problem, no matter how big, bad, or systemic it may be, and seeing things in a new (and brave) way. Progressive consciousness points towards the courage inside of all of us.

renewed sense of possibility? As a leader, how are you recognizing and acknowledging what you and your team have been through? According to Forbes, nearly 60% of leaders reported that they feel used up at the end of the workday – a strong indicator of burnout (http://bit.ly/km-forbes-burnout). Only 20% of surveyed leaders felt that they were effective at leading virtually. And 86% of high-potential employees report feeling burnt out – an audience that's twice as likely to leave an organization, compared to their peers. The human challenges are many, given recent history. Do you bring the same level of empathy and understanding that Tetia brought to me? (Location 1047)
