Speaker 0: look up all the acronyms that had yet another, there's all kinds of computer tools. I had y references and we look in the dictionary and kind of yahoo stood out partly. It was because if you look in the dictionary, it means people who are very uncivilized, Uncouth rude and we're like, that's great. We're just a couple of yahoo's,

Speaker 1: Wide Web.  
  
Speaker 0: Yeah. I um, I entered the PhD program in 1990. And then for the first couple of years we did classes and we worked on our thesis. By the time, I would say late 93, early 94 we were what they call a B. T all but thesis. And um, our advisor um ended up taking a sabbatical. He was gone for a year and he left us, you know, to to self regulate if you will.

Speaker 0: you know, so following that, we were in a lot of informal basketball leagues and play a lot of softball and tried our hand at football, but, you know, but at night we would we would have to go back and do some work, right, Because, you know, you have to publish or perish. And and so we we started to play more and more on the internet and that's that was sort of the (

Speaker 0: Rather than following some crazy hierarchical system that may or may not make sense to the user. So, so it was again this mental and mentality of really focusing on the user needs and creating a system that people kind of go, okay, I see how you got here. So next time I know I could I could start here or start there and making sure that's consistent and that's that was that was, you know, that's why I ended up being sort of a search metaphor too, is whatever keywords you typed in allows you to get to the right place, not multiple

Speaker 0: on april 1996. Yeah I remember driving down one and we went to we went to Montgomery um Securities on the day of the I. P. O. I was driving back down one on one going to work and it hits you, you know, it's like oh my God we're a public company. Uh But but because the internet was you know it was so competitive, it was a land grab and we had to at least you know, get enough cash that were not so that cash wasn't going to be the reason we didn't succeed, right?

Speaker 1: Yeah. Now the other thing that's a little bit different about what you did from what some people do today is right away. You guys hired a Ceo so how what was your thought process there? And, and, and did it work

Speaker 0: front of the bus, it's a moving train. And that was a great analogy. We do. It did feel like, you know, um, there was two things. One is we had a very, very, very stingy person in David filo so David, you know, controlled and uh, you know, everything on the hardware side, He really wanted to make sure that we were not wasteful. He was very, very much if you had a billion hits, it would be the cheapest building hits that would cost you rather than, you know, so he was very, very cost conscious and, and that was, I think a big part of our ability to scale so quickly. But also we had to, we had to really think about where the users want to go. We, we, (

Speaker 0: a human touch. And I think ultimately compared to sort of that first generation competitors. For whatever reason, people just thought, yahoo is a more human brand and we were very fortunate to attain that because I think that pay more sort of more dividends than we ever imagined.

Speaker 1: And, and this design for success, right? Like it feels like there's a tradeoff, right? I've, I've seen some startups that don't have product market fit and they have the best process and infrastructure you could imagine. And I've seen others that they get a royal flush and they don't have any way to monetize it because it just never occurred to them that it could happen. So like how did you guys think about that trade off?

Speaker 0: Yeah. I think I think designed for success is easier said than done because it is iterative and to me it has to have a healthy sense of pragmatism (

Speaker 0: second life, but you know, sort of, you know, so there was there was a mix of brands and sort of start ups and we had an agency to help us sell it and and it was hard to like decide how big the format should be and whether it was a banner or how do you charge for it? I think for the first six months I was the one that was sending out, you know, click through rates and logs and hits and you know and so so all the ad stats right? There was no, so so I think all of that you think about it that has become an industry, you have to really start from scratch, which is how big are you know what other mention of the ad units, How heavy are they are not heavy, where did they click to, what how do you report them? Um and and and I remember you know it was a lot of work, ([Time 0:27:44](https://www.airr.io/quote/6116b67f2ce741000e0c4dd0))

Speaker 0: people doing commercialization doing business film deals. I mean it was a heady time once the venture money started to go through startups that flowed right back to these big portals like us and A. O. L. And we had to be very careful about keeping our service free, keeping a user centric service. I mean more more focused on audience and the audience benefits and then respecting the ability for us to generate results for advertisers. And so this audience immunization dialogue was not always automatic in many ways it's it's intention all the time. So for us, there were there were a lot of hard conversations and there were a lot of hard conversations about products. You know, remember arguing over it ([Time 0:31:04](https://www.airr.io/quote/6116b7542ce741000e0c5257))
