The practice that molded me at Intel and saved me at Sun—that still inspires me today—is called OKRs. Short for O bjectives and K ey R esults. It is a collaborative goal-setting protocol for companies, teams, and individuals. (Location 162)

Now, OKRs are not a silver bullet. They cannot substitute for sound judgment, strong leadership, or a creative workplace culture. But if those fundamentals are in place, OKRs can guide you to the mountaintop. (Location 164)

defined OKRs: “A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization.” An OBJECTIVE , I explained, is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less. By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. When properly designed and deployed, they’re a vaccine against fuzzy thinking—and fuzzy execution. KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable. ( As prize pupil Marissa Mayer would say, “It’s not a key result unless it has a number.”) You either meet a key result’s requirements or you don’t; there is no gray area, no room for doubt.

At the end of the designated period, typically a quarter, we declare the key result fulfilled or not. Where an objective can be long-lived, rolled over for a year or longer, key results evolve as the work progresses. Once they are all completed, the objective is necessarily achieved. (And if it isn’t, the OKR was poorly designed in the first place.) (Location 174)

By way of illustration, I sketched two OKR scenarios. The first involved a fictional football team whose general manager cascades a top-level objective down through the franchise org chart. The second was a real-life drama to which I’d had a ringside seat: Operation Crush, the campaign to restore Intel’s dominance in the microprocessor market. (We’ll delve into both in detail later on.)

Goal setting isn’t bulletproof: “ When people have conflicting priorities or unclear, meaningless, or arbitrarily shifting goals, they become frustrated, cynical, and demotivated.” An effective goal management system—an OKR system—links goals to a team’s broader mission. It respects targets and deadlines while adapting to circumstances. It promotes feedback and celebrates wins, large and small. Most important, it expands our limits. It moves us to strive for what might seem beyond our reach. As (Location 210)

Then come the four OKR “superpowers”: focus, align, track, and stretch. Superpower \#1—Focus and Commit to Priorities (chapters 4, 5, and 6): High-performance organizations home in on work that’s important, and are equally clear on what doesn’t matter. OKRs impel leaders to make hard choices. They’re a precision communication tool for departments, teams, and individual contributors. By dispelling confusion, OKRs give us the focus needed to win.

Superpower \#2—Align and Connect for Teamwork (chapters 7, 8, and 9): With OKR transparency, everyone’s goals—from the CEO down—are openly shared. Individuals link their objectives to the company’s game plan, identify cross-dependencies, and coordinate with other teams. By connecting each contributor to the organization’s success, top-down alignment brings meaning to work. By deepening people’s sense of ownership, bottom-up OKRs foster engagement and innovation.

Superpower \#3—Track for Accountability (chapters 10 and 11): OKRs are driven by data. They are animated by periodic check-ins, objective grading, and continuous reassessment—all in a spirit of no-judgment accountability. An endangered key result triggers action to get it back on track, or to revise or replace it if warranted. (Location 297)

Now, the two key phrases . . . are objectives and the key result. And they match the two purposes. The objective is the direction: “We want to dominate the mid-range microcomputer component business.” That’s an objective. That’s where we’re going to go. Key results for this quarter: “Win ten new designs for the 8085” is one key result. It’s a milestone. The two are not the same. . . . The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it. Now, did we dominate the mid-range microcomputer business? That’s for us to argue in the years to come, but over the next quarter we’ll know whether we’ve won ten new designs or not. (Location 357)

The essence of a healthy OKR culture—ruthless intellectual honesty, a disregard for self-interest, deep allegiance to the team—flowed from the fiber of Andy Grove’s being. But it was Grove’s nuts-and-bolts approach, his engineer’s mentality, that made the system work. (Location 490)

Less is more. “A few extremely well-chosen objectives,” Grove wrote, “impart a clear message about what we say ‘yes’ to and what we say ‘no’ to.” A limit of three to five OKRs per cycle leads companies, teams, and individuals to choose what matters most. In general, each objective should be tied to five or fewer key results. (See chapter 4, “Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to Priorities.”) Set (Location 493)

In general, each objective should be tied to five or fewer key results. (See chapter 4, “Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to Priorities.”) Set goals from the bottom up. To promote engagement, teams and individuals should be encouraged to create roughly half of their own OKRs, in consultation with managers. When all goals are set top-down, motivation is corroded. (See chapter 7, “Superpower #2: Align and Connect for Teamwork.”) (Location 493)

No dictating. OKRs are a cooperative social contract to establish priorities and define how progress will be measured. Even after company objectives are closed to debate, their key results continue to be negotiated. Collective agreement is essential to maximum goal achievement. (See chapter 7, “Superpower #2: Align and Connect for Teamwork.”) (Location 500)

Stay flexible. If the climate has changed and an objective no longer seems practical or relevant as written, key results can be modified or even discarded mid-cycle. (See chapter 10, “Superpower #3: Track for Accountability.”) (Location 503)

Dare to fail. “Output will tend to be greater,” Grove wrote, “when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond [their] immediate grasp. . . . Such goal-setting is extremely important if what you want is peak performance from yourself and your subordinates.” While certain operational objectives must be met in full, aspirational OKRs should be uncomfortable and possibly unattainable. “Stretched goals,” as Grove called them, push organizations to new heights. (See chapter 12, “Superpower #4: Stretch for Amazing.”) (Location 505)

tool, not a weapon. The OKR system, Grove wrote, “is meant to pace a person—to put a stopwatch in his own hand so he can gauge his own performance. It is not a legal document upon which to base a performance review.” To encourage risk taking and prevent sandbagging, OKRs and bonuses are best kept separate.

Be patient; be resolute. Every process requires trial and error. As Grove told his iOPEC students, Intel “stumbled a lot of times” after adopting OKRs: “We didn’t fully understand the principal purpose of it. And we are kind of doing better with it as time goes on.” An organization may need up to four or five quarterly cycles to fully embrace the system, and even more than that to build mature goal muscle.

Bill grafted the critical connective tissue—the phrase “as measured by,” or a.m.b.—into Intel’s company OKRs. For example, “We will achieve a certain OBJECTIVE as measured by the following KEY RESULTS. . . .” Bill’s a.m.b made the implicit explicit to all. (Location 544)

If you tell everybody to go to the center of Europe, and some start marching off to France, and some to Germany, and some to Italy, that’s no good—not if you want them all going to Switzerland. If the vectors point in different directions, they add up to zero. But if you get everybody pointing in the same direction, you maximize the results. That was the pitch Grove gave me—and then he told me I had to teach it.” (Location 550)

To win in the global marketplace, organizations need to be more nimble than ever before. In my experience, a quarterly OKR cadence is best suited to keep pace with today’s fast-changing markets. A three-month horizon curbs procrastination and leads to real performance gains. In High Output Management , his leadership bible, Andy Grove notes: (Location 707)

For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon after the activity it is measuring occurs. Accordingly, an [OKR] system should set objectives for a relatively short period. For example, if we plan on a yearly basis, the corresponding [OKR] time should be at least as often as quarterly or perhaps even monthly. (Location 709)

There is no religion to this protocol, no one-size-fits-all. An engineering team might opt for six-week OKR cycles to stay in sync with development sprints. A monthly cycle could do the trick for an early-stage company still finding its product-market fit. The best OKR cadence is the one that fits the context and culture of your business. (Location 712)

To safeguard quality while pushing for quantitative deliverables, one solution is to pair key results—to measure “both effect and counter-effect,” as Grove wrote in High Output Management. When key results focus on output, Grove noted: [ T]heir paired counterparts should stress the quality of [the] work. Thus, in accounts payable, the number of vouchers processed should be paired with the number of errors found either by auditing or by our suppliers. For another example, the number of square feet cleaned by a custodial group should be paired with a . . . rating of the quality of work as assessed by a senior manager with an office in that building.

The one thing an [OKR] system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. . . . Each time you make a commitment, you forfeit your chance to commit to something else. This, of course, is an inevitable, inescapable consequence of allocating any finite resource. People who plan have to have the guts, honesty, and discipline to drop projects as well as to initiate them, to shake their heads “no” as well as to smile “yes.” . . . We must realize—and act on the realization—that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. (Location 783)

My objective has two key results: win the Super Bowl and fill the stands to at least 90 percent capacity, which is HOW I will make money for the owner. If I fulfill both of those HOWs , there is no way we can fail to show a profit. So it’s a well-constructed OKR. (Location 1074)

In moderation, cascading makes an operation more coherent. But when all objectives are cascaded, the process can degrade into a mechanical, color-by-numbers exercise, with four adverse effects: A loss of agility. Even medium-size companies can have six or seven reporting levels. As everyone waits for the waterfall to trickle down from above, and meetings and reviews sprout like weeds, each goal cycle can take weeks or even months to administer. Tightly cascading organizations tend to resist fast and frequent goal setting. Implementation is so cumbersome that quarterly OKRs may prove impractical. A lack of flexibility. Since it takes so much effort to formulate cascaded goals, people are reluctant to revise them mid-cycle. Even minor updates can burden those downstream, who are scrambling to keep their goals aligned. Over time, the system grows onerous to maintain. Marginalized contributors. Rigidly cascaded systems tend to shut out input from frontline employees. In a top-down ecosystem, contributors will hesitate to share goal-related concerns or promising ideas. One-dimensional linkages. While cascading locks in vertical alignment, it’s less effective in connecting peers horizontally, across departmental lines. (Location 1097)

Precisely because OKRs are transparent, they can be shared without cascading them in lockstep. If it serves the larger purpose, multiple levels of hierarchy can be skipped over. Rather than laddering down from the CEO to a VP to a director to a manager (and then to the manager’s reports), an objective might jump from the CEO straight to a manager, or from a director to an individual contributor.

Having goals improves performance. Spending hours cascading goals up and down the company, however, does not. . . . We have a market-based approach, where over time our goals all converge because the top OKRs are known and everyone else’s OKRs are visible. Teams that are grossly out of alignment stand out, and the few major initiatives that touch everyone are easy enough to manage directly. (Location 1116)

A move to quarterly OKRs would have generated 328,000 files per year. (Location 1454)

Continue : If a green zone (“on track”) goal isn’t broken, don’t fix it. Update : Modify a yellow zone (“needs attention”) key result or objective to respond to changes in the workflow or external environment. What could be done differently to get the goal on track? Does it need a revised time line? Do we back-burner other initiatives to free up resources for this one? Start : Launch a new OKR mid-cycle, whenever the need arises. Stop : When a red zone (“at risk”) goal has outlived its usefulness, the best solution may be to drop it. * The point of a real-time dashboard is to quantify progress against a target and flag what needs attention. While OKRs are primarily a positive force for more , they also stop us from persisting in the wrong direction.

Committed objectives are tied to Google’s metrics: product releases, bookings, hiring, customers. Management sets them at the company level, employees at the departmental level.

Engineers struggle with goal setting in two big ways. They hate crossing off anything they think is a good idea, and they habitually underestimate how long it takes to get things done. (Location 2001)

Say you have some rocks, and a bunch of pebbles, and some sand, and your goal is to fit as much of everything as you can into a wide-mouth, one-gallon jar. If you start with the sand, and then the pebbles, the jar will run out of room for all the rocks. But when you start with the rocks, add the pebbles, and save the sand for last, the sand fills the spaces between the rocks—everything fits. In other words, the most important things need to get done first or they won’t get done at all. (Location 2008)

Continuous Performance Management: OKRs and CFRs Talking can transform minds, which can transform behaviors, which can transform institutions. —Sheryl Sandberg (Location 2164)

That transformational system, the contemporary alternative to annual reviews, is continuous performance management . It is implemented with an instrument called CFRs, for: Conversations : an authentic, richly textured exchange between manager and contributor, aimed at driving performance Feedback : bidirectional or networked communication among peers to evaluate progress and guide future improvement Recognition : expressions of appreciation to deserving individuals for contributions of all sizes (Location 2177)

You need continuous performance management to surface the critical questions: Was the goal harder to achieve than you’d thought when you set it? Was it the right goal in the first place? Is it motivating? Should we double down on the two or three things that really worked for us last quarter, or is it time to consider a pivot? (Location 2188)

“On the other hand, if you don’t have goals, what the heck are you talking about? What did you achieve, and how? In my experience, people are more likely to feel fulfilled when they have clear and aligned targets. They’re not wandering and wondering about their work; they can see how it connects and helps the organization.” (Location 2191)

To hazard another football analogy: Let’s say objectives are the goalposts, the targets you’re aiming for, and key results the incremental yard markers for getting there. To flourish as a group, players and coaches need something more, something vital to any collective endeavor. CFRs embody all the interactions that tie the team together from one game to the next. They’re the Monday videotape postmortems, the midweek intrasquad meetings, the preplay huddles—and the end-zone celebrations for jobs well done. (Location 2193)

Continuous Performance Management at Pact Pact, the Washington, D.C.–based international trade and development nonprofit, has seen firsthand the synergy between OKRs and continuous performance management. Tim Staffa, a Pact director, says: “We embraced OKRs because our performance management process was moving to a more frequent cadence. When Pact adopted OKRs, we officially killed our annual performance review. We replaced it with a set of more frequent touch points between managers and employees. (Location 2223)

Internally, we’ve dubbed this ‘Propel.’ It consists of four elements: “The first is a set of monthly one-on-one conversations between employees and their managers about how things are going. “The second is a quarterly review of progress against our OKRs. We sit down and say, ‘What did you set out to accomplish this quarter? What were you able to do—and what weren’t you able to do? Why or why not? What can we change?’ “Third, we have a semiannual professional development conversation. Employees talk about their career trajectory—where they’ve been, where they are, where they want to go. And how their managers and the organization can support their new direction. “The fourth bit is ongoing, self-driven insight. We’re constantly surrounded by positive reinforcement and feedback, but many of us haven’t been trained to seek it out. Say you give a presentation to your team. After the fact, somebody comes up to you and says, ‘Hey, nice job.’ Most of us would say, ‘Oh great, thanks,’ and move on. But we want to probe a little deeper: ‘Thank you. What one thing did you like about it?’ The idea is to capture more specific feedback in real time.” (Location 2228)

Peter Drucker was one of the first to stress the value of regular one-on-one meetings between managers and their direct reports.

is mutual teaching and exchange of information. By talking about specific problems and situations, the supervisor teaches the subordinate his skills and know-how, and suggests ways to approach things. At the same time, the subordinate provides the supervisor with detailed information about what he is doing and what he is concerned about. . . . A key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the subordinate’s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him. . . . The supervisor is there to learn and coach. * The supervisor should also encourage the discussion of heart-to-heart issues during one-on-ones, because this is the perfect forum for getting at subtle and deep work-related problems affecting his subordinate. Is he satisfied with his own performance? Does some frustration or obstacle gnaw at him? Does he have doubts about where he is going? (Location 2266)

Our leaders role-modeled Check-in. They needed to show they were open to feedback themselves, and comfortable being questioned on their vision. Now we treat every manager as a business leader. They are allocated budgets for base incentives and equity, a pool of money to be distributed as they see fit. It’s super-empowering for them to know they are truly responsible for their reports. It’s equally empowering for employees to know they have input into the process. By scheduling regular Check-ins through the year, they keep their manager apprised of their progress against action items and goals from prior conversations, along with development needs and ideas for how they might grow. And now that we’ve done away with fixed pots of compensation, teammates are no longer competitors. (Location 2370)

They also have more subtle, internal, quotidian effects—like grooming better executives, or giving less vocal contributors an opportunity to shine. On the long and demanding road to operating excellence, they help organizations improve each and every day. Leaders become better communicators and motivators. Contributors grow into more disciplined, rigorous thinkers. When imbued with meaningful conversations and feedback, structured goal setting teaches people how to work within constraints even as they push against them—an especially critical lesson for smaller, scaling operations.

Going on two years later, Zume is beating those odds by making world-class pizza at a competitive price. The company assigns rote tasks to machines, freeing its people for creative jobs that add more value. Dollars saved on manual labor get plowed into higher-quality ingredients: dough from non-GMO flours, organically grown tomatoes, locally sourced vegetables, and healthfully cured meats.

As online or mobile app orders link into Zume’s conveyor belt, robots stretch and shape the dough, apply the sauce, and safely slide the pizzas into an 800-degree oven. With robotics technology continuing to mature, the company plans to automate the entire process, from adding cheese and custom toppings to loading the partly baked pies into Zume’s fleet of algorithmically operated, baking-on-the-way trucks. (In the future, there’s a fair chance those trucks will be driverless.) Within three months of launch, Zume had achieved 10 percent market share in its local trade area. In 2018, it began disrupting the pizza oligopoly across the Bay Area. Soon it will roll out across the West Coast, and then nationally; by 2019, the founders hope to be overseas. “We’re going to be the Amazon of food,” says cofounder Alex Garden, who first met OKRs as president of Zynga Studios.

Then one day, all of a sudden, you’re a manager. Let’s assume you do well and move up to manage more and more people. Now you’re no longer paid for the amount of work you do; you’re paid for the quality of decisions you make. But no one tells you the rules have changed. When you hit a wall, you think, I’ll just work harder—that’s what got me here. What (Location 2491)
