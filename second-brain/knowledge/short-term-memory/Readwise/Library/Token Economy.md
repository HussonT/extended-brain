The media keeps referring to cryptocurrencies, even when talking of non-currency tokens, while reducing the underlying blockchain networks to objects of speculation, instead of focusing on the fact that they provide - first and foremost - a promising governance infrastructure that could resolve many problems of the Internet we use today, such as: (a) the fact that we have no control over what happens with our private data, (b) the lack of transparency along the supply chain of goods, services, and financial payments, or (c) the fact that the Internet lacks an inherent payment settlement layer, forcing us to rely on trusted Internet platforms such as Amazon, Airbnb, or Uber.

There seems to be too little understanding about the fact that Bitcoin is a blockchain network, which is (a) globally managed by people who mostly do not know each other, and (b) enabled by the consensus protocol that (c) incentivizes all network actors for their contributions with a native token.

If we assume that the WWW revolutionized information, and that the Web2 revolutionized interactions, the Web3 has the potential to revolutionize agreements and value exchange. The Web3 changes the data structures in the backend of the Internet, introducing a universal state layer, often by incentivizing network actors with a token. The backbone of this Web3 is represented by a series of blockchain networks or similar distributed (Location 235)

our data is mostly centrally stored: on local or remote servers, on our personal computers, mobile devices, flash drives, and increasingly also on our watches, cars, TVs, or fridges. This raises issues of trust. (Location 243)

Blockchain networks are not at all ideal for storing data, for two main reasons: (i) public blockchain networks are too slow and too expensive to store large data sets; and (ii) storing plain-text data blockchain networks doesn’t allow for “privacy by design.”2 To create a decentralized YouTube, for example, decentralized file storage is needed to manage the video files.

Speed, performance, and usability are bottlenecks in the Web3 that will very likely be resolved over time, once the core components of the Web3 are up and running (read more: Annex - Scalability). It is likely that the future of the Internet will be more decentralized, however, this does not mean that we will get rid of centralized systems altogether. (Location 336)

Chapter Summary ~ The Internet we have today is broken. We do not control our data, nor do we have a native value settlement layer. Every time we interact over the Internet, copies of our data get sent to the server of a service provider, and every time that happens, we lose control over our data. This raises issues of trust. ~ The Internet we use today stores and manages data on the servers of trusted institutions. In the Web3 data is stored in multiple copies of a P2P network, and the management rules are formalized in the protocol, and secured by majority consensus of all network participants, often (but not always) incentivized with a network token for their activities. ~ In the Web3 the state of the network (represented by the ledger) is collectively maintained. ~ While the Web2 was a front-end revolution, the Web3 is a backend revolution, introducing a universal state layer. It is a set of protocols led by a blockchain network or similar distributed ledger, which intends to reinvent how the Internet is wired in the backend. The Web3 combines the system functions of the Internet with the system functions of computers. ~ As opposed to centralized applications that run on a single computer, decentralized applications run on a P2P network of computers. They have existed since the advent of P2P networks. Decentralized applications don’t necessarily need to run on top of a blockchain network. ~ A decentralized application is a blockchain client called “wallet.” It uses the same technologies to render a webpage or a mobile app (like HTML, CSS, Javascript) but communicates with a blockchain network instead of a server and, in the case of smart contract networks, also the smart contracts. The wallet also manages the public-private key-pair and the blockchain address, to provide a unique identity for network nodes and allow them to interact with the network. ~ (Location 366)

Keeping Track of the Tokens: Bitcoin, Blockchain, & Other Distributed Ledgers Blockchain networks build on the idea of P2P networks, providing a universal data set that every actor can trust, even though they might not know or trust each other. Immutable copies of that data are stored and managed on every node in the network. Economic incentives in the form of native network tokens are applied to make the network fault tolerant, attack resistant, and collusion resistant. (Location 445)

Blockchain protocols and similar distributed ledgers operate on top of the Internet and can be conceptualized in several components: (i) physical network: represented by a P2P network of computers that run the same protocol; (ii) protocol: defines the network rules and enforces them by consensus8 of all network nodes. This includes economic incentives tied to the native token; (iii) ledger: managing all assets in the form of a shared and public ledger of all transactions from the genesis block until today; (iv) identification & addressing: Assets belong to identities which need to be addressed so we can transfer values from one to another.

Early Proof-of-Stake proposals assumed that those who have more stake in the system have a natural incentive to act in a truthful manner when validating transactions and writing blocks. (Location 764)

There are even more variations of Proof-of-Stake, most of which are only conceptual or have been implemented by one network only: “Leased Proof-of-Stake,” “Transactions as Proof-of-Stake,” “Proof-of-Importance,” “Proof-of-Capacity,” “Proof-of-Weight,” “Proof-of-Authority,” and “Proof-of-Elapsed-Time.” (Location 791)

Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): Another group of consensus mechanisms are variations of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) like Federated Byzantine Agreements (FBA) as implemented by “Ripple” or “Stellar”, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) as implemented by “Hyperledger Fabric”, and Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) as used in “NEO.” Yet another group of protocols uses a combination of mechanisms, such as “Hashgraph” that combines asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance with “gossip protocols” and “virtual voting” mechanisms. Directed Acyclic Graphs: Furthermore, there is a whole series of protocols that use Directed Acyclic Graphs, such as “IoT Chain,” “Byteball,” “Nano” (Block Lattice), and IOTA (Tangle). The consensus mechanism of DAGs is fundamentally different from blockchains. Instead of bundling data together into blocks that are then confirmed one after another, Directed Acyclic Graphs require newly added data to reference and validate past data. Usually, each new transaction would have to reference and validate two transactions that came before. In doing so, the network comes to form a graph of converging and confirmed transactions. If a node incorrectly validates a past transaction, that node’s transaction would fail to be confirmed by other participants. Explaining each of the consensus mechanisms listed above in detail is beyond the scope of this book and would require one or several dedicated publications. Literature on these protocols in the context of distributed ledgers is still scarce but growing. However, many of these protocols are still in a conceptual stage, without proper documentation. In many cases they are implemented by one project only, sometimes without being properly researched, or without having undergone the academic peer-review process.   ￼ (Location 793)

They can further be used to provide more control over our private data (read more: Part 1 - User-Centric Identities - Data Protection) and create P2P data markets (Ocean Protocol). While in theory this level of transparency of what happened to one’s private data could also be provided with current solutions, we would have to trust a centralized institution. (Location 897)

Chapter Summary ~ Blockchain networks are public infrastructures that collectively maintain a shared and distributed ledger, where immutable and encrypted copies of the information are stored on every computer in the network. ~ The ledger contains all transactions ever made. Transactions are stored in a tamper-proof fashion: alteration in a block will change the subsequent blocks. The ledger, stored on all the computers of the network, guarantees that each token is transferred only once. It acts as a digital notary, and a publicly verifiable timestamp. ~ All network participants have equal access to the same data in real time. Transactions processed by the network are transparent to all actors and can be traced back to their origin. ~ Unlike distributed databases, blockchains allow for distributed control, where different parties that do not trust each other can share information without requiring a central administrator. Algorithmic administration of business logic and governance rules, with consensus protocols and smart contracts provide for the next level of automation of our socio-economic activities. ~ The blockchain concept builds on the idea of P2P networks and provides a universal data set that every actor can trust, even though they might not know or trust each other. People and institutions who do not know or trust each other and reside in different countries, being subject to different jurisdictions, and who have no legally binding agreements with each other can now interact over the Internet without the need for trusted third parties like banks, Internet platforms, or other types of clearing institutions. ~ Ideas around cryptographically secured P2P networks have been discussed in the academic environment in different evolutionary stages since the 1980s. However, before the emergence of Bitcoin, there had never been a practical implementation of a P2P network that managed to avoid the double-spending problem, without the need for trusted intermediaries guaranteeing value exchange. ~ The “double-spending problem” refers to the fact that in the current Internet, digital money, in the form of a file, can be copied, and copies of that same digital file can be sent from one computer to multiple other computers at the same time. ~ Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work, allow for distributed control. They are based on the combination of economic incentives and cryptography. Applied game theory is used to reward network actors with a native network token. This reward mechanism is designed in a way that it is economically infeasible to cheat the network. It makes it exceedingly difficult to falsify the blockchain, due to the immense amount of computing power that would be required to do so. ~ As opposed to public and permissionless networks, permissioned networks are invite only, which means that all validators are members of a consortium. ~ “Distributed ledger” has emerged as an umbrella term used to describe technologies which distribute records or information among all those using it, whether permissioned or permissionless, and independent of their consensus mechanisms or data structures.

In order to be considered resilient, cryptographic hash functions need to fulfill certain properties: They need to be designed in a way that they are (i) easy to compute; (ii) deterministic, meaning that the same message always results in the same hash; (iii) time consuming and expensive to generate a message from its hash value with sheer brute force; (iv) small changes to the original input value should change the hash value.

A more autonomous solution to the problem of losing your private keys could be so-called “social key recovery solutions,” where you can appoint a set of trusted friends, family members, or institutions to confirm your identity and allow key recovery in a multi-signature process. (Location 1242)

Chapter Summary ~ Cryptography is the practice and study of secure communication in the presence of third parties. The aim is to create information systems that are resilient against eavesdropping, manipulation, and other forms of attack. ~ Cryptography in blockchain networks allows for transparency of interactions while maintaining the privacy of all network actors. ~ Public-key cryptography is used to prove one’s identity with a set of cryptographic keys: a private key and a public key, which in combination with a transaction creates our digital signature. This digital signature proves ownership of our tokens and allows us to control them through a piece of software called a “wallet.” ~ Similar to a handwritten signature, a digital signature is used to verify that you are who you say you are. In Bitcoin and other blockchains, digital signatures are mathematical functions that reference a specific wallet address that manages your tokens on a blockchain. ~ A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that can take any type of input, such as a string, a text file, or a picture file, and digest it to a fixed-size output string called a hash. It is a one-way function, which means that the only way to recreate the original input data (message) from the hash is to attempt to try all possible variations to see if they produce a match. While this is possible, it is time consuming and therefore expensive.

Separating the process of (i) issuing a credential, (ii) making a claim, and (iii) validating those claims against credentials is crucial to a user-centric setup. It can be seen as a system of checks and balances in a data-driven economy that guarantees the level of autonomy and privacy over one’s digital footprint, and is very contrary to how the Internet is set up today.

Chapter Summary ~ Historically, identity processes, such as passports, driver’s licenses, social security cards, or serial numbers for goods, have been issued by centralized institutions such as local and national governments and other trusted institutions. The emergence of the Internet created the need for digital identification systems. ~ From a computer science perspective, the term “identity” can be reduced to the data elements related to the identity management process: “identifier,” “authentication,” and “credentials.” ~ Identifiers are needed to uniquely identify a person, institution, or object. An identifier needs to be unique and persistent over time. ~ Authentication is the process with which a person, institution, or object can prove that they are who they claim they are. A person can authenticate themselves by proving ownership of an object (ID card, hardware wallet, software wallet), knowledge (password or PIN), or by a personal property (biometric data, signature). Often, a combination of these systems is used. ~ An identity is useless without linking data related to a person (personal data), institution (institutional data), or object (object-related data) to the identifier. ~ The current Internet was built around connecting machines, not people. The Internet does not provide a native identity layer for people, institutions, or objects other than the operating nodes in a network of computers. Workaround solutions have been built on the application layer using internal databases (private infrastructure) to manage all the data involved with digital identity management processes. All user-related data is managed by the service provider, on their private server infrastructure, and that all elements related to the identity management process are centralized. ~ These data silos and proprietary identity solutions have created considerable costs and trade-offs, both for companies and users alike such as (i) password chaos, (ii) protection against bad actors, (iii) data protection & custodial costs, (iv) data portability, (v) lack of control & sovereignty over data, and the (vi) re-centralization of the Internet. ~ Blockchain networks and similar distributed ledgers use public-key cryptography for the identification of all network actors, but they are insufficient for a thriving tokenized economy. However, combined with DIDs, they can offer critical components for more “user-centric” identity solutions that are suitable for the Web3, and provide more privacy and control than “server-centric” solutions used in the Web2. ~ The user-centric identity process requires three actors: (i) identity issuers, (ii) identity owners, and (iii) identity verifiers. If set up correctly, anyone in a blockchain network can verify whether a piece of data (credential) is valid and which institutions attested to the validity of the data without revealing the data itself. ~ While plain text data should never be stored on a public ledger, a privacy-preserving identity management system can use distributed ledgers to allow a person to prove that their personal identity-related data fulfills certain requirements without revealing the actual data. In such a setup, distributed ledgers can be used to attest the authenticity of the data and attestations, only registering indirect “pointers” for the purpose of verification. ~ A user can create and register a DID when activating a blockchain wallet, which creates a pair of private and public keys. Public-key cryptography is used for authentication and encryption. Only the private key can prove one’s identity. The private key acts as your personal lock on the wallet. ~ Any DID can be linked to attestations (verifiable credentials) that are issued by other people and institutions attesting specific characteristics for an identity owner, such as name, address, email, age, existing diplomas, or other certifications such as a driver’s license. The credentials are signed by their issuers using public-key cryptography. Once signed by an issuer, credentials can be managed using the wallet of the identity owner directly. ~ The separation of the “identifier,” “authentication,” and “data” is crucial to a user-centric setup. It can be seen as a system of checks and balances in a data-driven economy that guarantees the level of autonomy and privacy over one’s digital footprint, and is very contrary to how the Internet is set up today. Using a public infrastructure such as a collectively maintained ledger as a unique source of truth, while splitting the roles in the identification management process, makes user-centric identity management systems “decentralized.” ~ The wallet acts as a personal container that allows you to control your digital identities. The wallet is the digital equivalent to a physical wallet, which usually acts as a container for all your ID cards, such as driver’s license, bank card, gym membership, national ID card, social security card, or loyalty cards, in addition to your money. While it is initially empty, over time, one can fill it with credentials that represent the digital version of your driver's license, bank card, gym membership, national ID card, social security card, loyalty cards, etc. ~ Just as you open your wallet to reveal your ID card, you need to activate your Web3 wallet to reveal your digital credentials to third parties (using a password). No one can see the contents of your Web3 wallet without your consent. You choose who to share these credentials with. The content of the wallet remains concealed until you choose to reveal something. The digital wallet is portable, as a dedicated hardware device, or an app in your mobile phone or your notebook. ~ (Location 1614)

Part 2: Web3 Applications ~ The first chapter explains how smart contracts can encode and algorithmically enforce the business logic or governance rules of simple or complex agreements. The following two chapters will shed light on the institutional economics and governance aspects of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, the most complex form of a smart contract that are steered by purpose-driven tokens. The last chapter will introduce tokens as the atomic unit of the Web3 and dive into the history, definition, and properties of different types of tokens. (Location 1809)

Smart Contracts A smart contract is a piece of software that is processed by a distributed ledger. It is a rights management tool that can formalize and execute agreements between untrusted participants over the Internet, and comes with inbuilt compliance and controlling. Smart contracts can reduce the costs of formalization and enforcement of a simple agreement between two parties, the bylaws of an organization, or to create different types of tokens. ~ (Location 1816)

Would you enter into a contract with someone whom you’ve never met, and therefore don’t know and don’t trust? Would you become an investor in a small company in a foreign country? Would you agree to lend money to a stranger, like a farmer in Guatemala, a teacher in China, or a cashier in the UK? Or would you set up a legally binding contract for a 1 EUR purchase over the Internet, like buying a song from an artist? The answer in all of the above mentioned cases is probably no, as the cost of setting up the necessary legal contract to secure your transaction is too high. Alternatively, you could use trusted intermediaries to settle such contracts, paying them settlement fees for their services. The business models of many Web2 tech giants like Amazon, eBay, Airbnb, and Uber result from the lack of a trustful native value-settlement layer and user centric-identity systems. Smart contracts in combination with user-centric identity systems can provide a solution to both problems. They can formalize the relationships between people and institutions and the assets they own, entirely P2P, without the need for trusted intermediaries. (Location 1820)

more primitive form of a smart contract is a vending machine. The rules of a transaction are programmed into a machine. You select a product by pressing a number related to the product you want and insert money. If you insert enough money, the machine is programmed to eject the product. If not, you would not receive the product, or if the machine ran out of the product, you would get your money back. Automatic vending machines made certain street sellers obsolete, but they also expanded service, offering 24/7 availability instead of the limited opening hours of a human-operated vendor.

Smart contracts reduce the transaction costs of agreements. Specifically, they reduce the costs of (i) reaching an agreement, (ii) formalization, and (iii) enforcement. If implemented correctly, smart contracts could provide transaction security superior to traditional contract law, thereby reducing coordination costs of auditing and enforcement of such agreements. Smart contracts also bypass the principal-agent dilemma21 of organizations, providing more transparency and accountability, and reducing bureaucracy (read more: Part 2 - Institutional Economics of DAOs).

While such developments might take more time to mature, some interesting dispute-resolution solutions are already under development, examples of which are “Kleros,” “Openlaw,” or “Jur.” We will probably see a fusion of legal contracts and smart contracts emerge over the next few years. At the time of writing this book, best practices are still rare and will require a collective learning process. The technology is still nascent, and legal standards need to be adopted.

The P2P nature of payments enabled by smart contracts reduces the transaction costs, which means that micropayments could become economically more feasible than they are today.22 Smart access controls between two peers who do not trust each other could provide a practical solution for the sharing economy without centralized platform providers, who currently own a disproportionate part of our data, and therefore also the economic value created. This could lead to a sharing economy on steroids: apartments, cars, washing machines, bicycles, lawn mowers—once all those devices are tagged with their own blockchain address (or DID) they could be managed by a smart contract that acts as a digital lock. A more complex example of a smart contract is the use case of a self-managing forest, as in the case of “Terra0,” where a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain manages the logging and selling of trees from a forest in Germany. Drones and satellites monitor the growth of the forest and trigger events in the smart contract, like subcontracting agreements to log the forest and sell off the wood. Furthermore, smart contracts can be used for much more complex agreements between a multitude of actors, along the supply chain of goods or services, or for governing a group of people that share the same interests and goals without the need of traditional centralized institutions. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are such an example and probably represent the most common form of complex smart contracts. The smart contract hereby formalizes the governance rules of an organization—like the bylaws, governing statutes, rules of procedure—and replaces day-to-day operational management with self-enforcing code. Smart contracts and DAOs could also disrupt social media as we know it. Web2-based social media networks extract rent in the form of data from the users that they monetize. In the Web3, smart contracts can enable purpose-driven ecosystems, in which users can benefit from their network activities by getting rewarded with network tokens. An example thereof would be “Steemit,” a decentralized social network that is organized as a DAO and incentivizes user contributions with network tokens (read more: Part 4 - Steemit). Smart contracts and distributed ledgers could also be a catalyst for machine-to-machine settlement in an “Internet of Things.” This, however, requires that all objects in such an Internet of Things have a blockchain identity, and can thus be uniquely addressed. Addressability of each single machine or other physical object needs to be tamper proof. This can be achieved by tagging or chipping objects with a so-called “crypto accelerator,” which is also referred to as a “digital twin.” (Location 1870)

The most complex form of a smart contract is a decentralized autonomous organization. Smart contracts can also be used to create tokens. ~ Smart contracts have the potential to disrupt many industries. Use cases can be found in banking, insurance, energy, e-government, telecommunication, music & film industry, fine art, mobility, education, and many more. ~ Oracles provide the external data necessary for the smart contract and trigger smart contract executions when predefined conditions are met. Oracles are services that find and verify real world occurrences and submit this information to a smart contract, automatically triggering state changes on the blockchain. The primary task of oracles is to provide these values to the smart contract in a secure and trusted manner. These data flows stem either from software (Big Data application) or hardware (Internet of Things). (Location 2023)

Institutional Economics of Web3 Networks & other DAOs 26 Institutional economics studies the role of formal or informal institutions - such as procedure, convention, arrangement, traditions and customs - in a socio-economic context. Since the emergence of the Internet many distributed Internet tribes have formed, like social media platforms, e-commerce platforms or knowledge platforms. Web3 networks introduce a new type of Internet-based institutional infrastructure that enables distributed Internet tribes to self organize and coordinate in a more autonomous way, steered by purpose-driven tokens, and executed with machine-enforceable protocols. They are commonly referred to as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). (Location 2096)

Blockchain networks and similar distributed ledgers can disrupt traditional governance27 structures and challenge the current forms of how society organizes itself. They can (i) reduce the principal-agent dilemma of organizations by providing transparency; (ii) incentivize network actors with a native token, thereby disintermediating and reducing management costs, and (iii) replace the reactive procedural security of the current legal system, with proactive and automated mechanisms that make a potential breach of contract expensive, and therefore infeasible.

Furthermore, the voting process involved personal intervention, with bad wallet usability, excluding many smaller and technically less adept token holders from participating in voting processes. The whole incident showed that “decentralization” is also a question of human behavior, and thus also subject to behavioral economics, and never only a mathematical or technical question.

Newer Web3 applications have focused on providing a plug-and-play end-to-end framework to build DAOs. The tool-set provided include elements such as constitutional frameworks, dispute-resolution frameworks, and many more, so that new DAO projects don’t have to build all organizational and institutional elements necessary from scratch. They reduce the technical costs of setting up a decentralized organization, so you can focus on what you want to build (the purpose of your network) and how you want to build it (the governance rules of your network.)

DAOs vs. Traditional Organizations Large parts of our society are organized in top-down command and control structures. The role of the legal system is to secure and enforce all contractual agreements of all institutions that regulate our socio-economic interactions. The example of such legal frameworks are (i) the constitution of a country, (ii) employment contracts between employee and organization, (iii) supply agreements, purchase agreements, or sales contracts between the organizations, or (iv) bilateral or multilateral agreements between governments of different nations.

Evolution of Companies and the “Theory of the Firm”: In his book “The Theory of the Firm,” economist Ronald Coase argued that firms arise if they can produce what they need internally more efficiently than through outsourcing—taking into account all costs, such as search, information acquisition, bargaining, and policing of business partnerships or engaging in bilateral trading in the marketplace. His theories explain the concentration of economic production, through vertical integration of production, and the subsequent rise of multinational corporations, from the Industrial Revolution until the late 20th century.

Recent political history suggests high levels of disenchantment in the general public toward established political governance systems, which political scientists refer to as “Post Democracy.” It is characterized by an increasingly remote governing elite, coupled with increased clamor from the citizenry to reclaim their place in decision making. Globalization effects, such as free trade, cheaper and faster transport, and the Internet, have further undermined the power of a nation state to regulate the life of its citizens. One suggested solution to this disenchantment is “Liquid Democracy,” a type of democratic governance whereby an electorate delegates voting power in a more flexible manner, allowing for differentiation in the powers delegated and the timeframe of the delegation.

Furthermore, while the network might be geographically decentralized, with many independent but equal network actors, the governance rules written in the smart contract or blockchain protocol will always be a point of centralization and loss of direct autonomy. DAOs can be architecturally decentralized (independent actors run different nodes), and are geographically decentralized (subject to different jurisdictions), but they are logically centralized around the protocol. The question of how to upgrade the protocol, when and if necessary, is very often delegated to a set of experts who understand the techno-legal intricacies of the code, and therefore represent a point of centralization (read more: Part 2 - On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Governance).

Web3 networks and smart contract based DAOs are complex systems that are composed of three interdependent networks: (i) a network of computers, (ii) a network of people, (iii) a network of flow of tokens. They are adaptive socio-economic networks that are dynamic in time and space. Dynamic refers to the continued state changes of the network as a result of the actions set by their human agents (sending tokens or consuming other network services, contributing with code, or forking into another network.) Adaptive means that DAO participants constantly adapt to the network they are part of because of the feedback-loops between the individual actors and the whole network. (Location 2226)

Steering refers to establishing goals, not telling the system what to do. These goals can be individual (individual wants and needs) and communal (social consensus about collective policies). Self-steering and co-steering systems, in political science, are often referred to as democracy. The Economist Friedrich von Hayek referred to cybernetics as a discipline that could also help economists understand markets as "self-organizing or self-generating systems complex phenomena" using the cybernetic feedback mechanism for economic pattern predictions. He explained Adam Smith's idea of the “invisible hand” as anticipation of the operation of the feedback mechanism in cybernetics. (Location 2235)

Chapter Summary ~ Since the emergence of the Internet, a vast array of distributed Internet tribes have formed, culminating in the social media platforms of today. DAOs represent dynamic networks governed by machine-enforceable protocols. They promise more decentralized and spontaneous coordination over the Internet between users who do not know or trust each other. ~ Web3 networks provide a public governance infrastructure that can minimize the existing principal-agent dilemma of organizations and subsequent moral hazards. Their native tokens provide a new form of incentives to automatically align interests in the absence of third parties. The Bitcoin network can be seen as the first decentralized autonomous organization of this kind. ~ Principal-agent dilemmas occur when the agent of an organization has the power to make decisions on behalf of or impacting the principal, another person or entity in the organization. Examples thereof could be managers that act on behalf of shareholders or politicians that act on behalf of citizens. Moral hazard occurs when one person takes more risks than they normally would, because someone else bears the cost of those risks. ~ A DAO can be formalized by a smart contract. Use cases range from simple to complex. The complexity depends on the number of stakeholders, as well as the number and complexity of processes within that organization. Depending on the purpose and governance rules, a DAO organization could resemble either companies or nation states. ~ Web3 protocols are comparable to the constitution and the governing laws of nation states. Similar to a blockchain network, nation states also have a code, the constitution, which is public, and open-source, but the laws cannot be self enforced. ~ In their institutional structure, public and permissionless blockchain networks resemble nation states much more than they resemble companies. The autonomous actors in the network are the sovereigns of the network, and are therefore subject to the network constitution, the blockchain protocol or smart contract code. The monetary policy of that network is defined in the protocol, and regulates the circumstances under which a network token is minted. The fiscal policy is also defined in the protocol, and regulates the transaction fees. ~ The monetary policy of a network token establishes the supply and availability of these tokens. These monetary policies, or “token supply,” can differ greatly from network to network. ~ (Location 2318)

Governance of Web3 Networks & Other DAOs Governance is the term that is colloquially used by many to describe the social consensus process over protocol evolution. It is a decision-making process that can happen either “off-chain” or “on-chain.” However, the governance process of a public blockchain network consists of two parts. In addition to the “social governance” process, that defines the network's policies on a collective level, the “algorithmic administration of governance” automates the enforcement of those policies. ~ (Location 2449)

while blockchain protocols and smart contracts are a great tool to replace large-scale bureaucracy, in their current form, they are an insufficient tool when confronted with “unknown unknowns” in complex multi-stakeholder environments. Smart contracts can only be as smart as the people who developed and audited them, based on the information, coding practices, and toolchains available to these people at the time of coding.

Checks & Balances in the Network As more diverse and alternative distributed ledger systems are entering the Web3 playing field, it is hard to generalize the stakeholders in such networks. To keep it simple, however, the main stakeholders of public blockchain networks can be summed up as (i) miners, (ii) developers, (iii) users running full nodes, (iv) users not running full nodes, and (v) the business ecosystem that might act as a market maker, including exchanges, merchants, etc. Miners write transactions to the ledger and keep the network safe from attacks. Their network contributions are incentivized by block rewards and transaction fees, which means that they tend to prefer protocol upgrades that could secure or increase their future earnings. Miners generally have a better ability to coordinate, as they are a smaller and more concentrated group. This gives them disproportionate power compared to other stakeholders who are more scattered and usually with less means to coordinate their interests. In theory, wealthy miners could pay developers to pursue protocol updates that are in their best interest, thereby gaining more power in the network. Developers create the protocol and maintain the network with regular (Location 2513)

Chapter Summary ~ Governance is the term that is colloquially used by many to describe the social consensus process over protocol evolution. It is a decision-making process that can happen either “off-chain” or “on-chain.” However, the governance process of a public blockchain network really consists of two parts. In addition to the “social governance” process, that defines the network's policies on a collective level, the “algorithmic administration of governance” automates the enforcement of those policies. ~ Algorithmic administration of governance refers to the protocol rules written in machine-readable code - a blockchain protocol or smart contract code - which are automatically enforced by the P2P network of computers. These protocol rules also define how protocol updates are to be conducted. ~ While Web3 and their applications allow us to automate certain bureaucratic functions of organization and formalize institutional rules with self-enforcing code, what we write in the code, or how we upgrade the code, is a result of public debate and collective action of all network agents. ~ Social governance refers to the human decision-making process over when and how to conduct potential protocol upgrades in a Web3 network or in the smart contract code of a DAO. It deals with the institutionalized decision-making process of how stakeholders in the network receive necessary information to make educated decisions about future protocol upgrades. ~ DAOs are co-steered by the human agents acting as node operators who all have different preferences and goals. They have collective influence over the general network behaviour (system outcome) and will react to the system outcome. ~ The human agents are part of the system and actively participate in the systems, either by using the services of a DAO (users), by contributing code to the network constitution (developers), or by contributing to maintain network services. ~ It is assumed that each stakeholder in the network has their own individual self-interest, and that these interests are not always fully aligned. Stakeholders in the network propose or vote for policy changes that will be formalized as protocol upgrades, reflecting their own self-interest. ~ Early blockchain protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on a simplistic assumption of “code is law” and have rather spontaneous and not well institutionalized social governance layers that happen “off-chain.” Several newer blockchain projects have introduced various “on-chain governance” models, with more sophisticated provisions for upgrade processes baked into the protocol. ~ Depending on the protocol, there are certain checks and balances in place, where miners and token holders who run full nodes can adopt proposed changes or not. The main stakeholders in a tokenized network can be summed up as (i) miners, (ii) developers, (iii) token holder running full nodes, (iv) token holders running light nodes, and (v) the business ecosystem that might act as a market maker, including exchanges, merchants, etc. ~ Off-chain governance describes a protocol upgrade process where decision making first takes place on a social level, and is then encoded into the protocol by developers. It has to be accepted by miners and users. Both the Bitcoin network and Ethereum network rely on off-chain governance processes. Developers share their improvement proposals online. Any developer can submit the so-called “pull requests” of an improvement proposal to the community. ~ On-chain governance allows developers to broadcast their improvement proposal on-chain, to be voted upon and deployed on the test network for a certain amount of time, after which the proposal will be voted upon again before it is deployed on the main network. This means that any decision that is being taken is automatically executed. ~ On-chain governance protocols might also be designed in a way to roll back and edit ledger history, allowing a “self-amending ledger,” as opposed to off-chain governance that requires a hard fork to erase a past transaction.

Tokens Tokens are the atomic unit of the Web3 and are collectively managed by a distributed ledger. They can be issued with just a few lines of code with a smart contract. Token contracts are rights management tools that can represent anything from a store of value to a set of permissions in the physical, digital, and legal world. They might affect the financial world similar to how the Internet affected the postal system. (Location 2747)

Tokens can provide (i) more transparency along marketplaces than existing financial systems currently offer. This could significantly reduce fraud or corruption along the supply chain of goods, services, and financial transactions. Tokens also have the potential of (ii) reducing the transaction costs of developing, managing, and trading cryptographic assets along distributed ledgers, as opposed to managing assets along state-of-the-art systems. As a result, (iii) increased liquidity, lower costs of price discovery, and less fragmented markets could reduce market friction, enabling more efficient marketplaces for certain assets like art or real estate.

Fungible assets have two key properties: (i) Only quantity matters, which means that units of fungible assets of the same kind are indistinguishable. (ii) Any amount can be merged or divided into a larger or smaller amount of it, making it indistinguishable from the rest. If you were to lend 10 EUR to someone, for example, it would not matter if that person returns the exact same 10 EUR bill or another one, or various bills and coins that amount to the value of 10 EUR.

Many economists remain skeptical that cryptographic tokens can permanently replace conventional currencies since: (i) There are strong network externalities that favor existing conventional currencies; (ii) The lack of sophisticated token supply rules leading to socially desirable stability and liquidity of tokenized economies. Furthermore, (iii) from a classic economic perspective, it seems impossible to pre-specify socially optimal “lender-of-last resort” rules in a smart contract. Lender-of-last resort refers to a safety-net institution, usually provided by central banks, to reduce the risk of a lack of liquidity of financial systems as a result of financial panics and bank runs. It represents government-guaranteed liquidity to financial institutions. The lack of such a lender-of-last resort makes financial systems susceptible to financial crises and systemic panics.

It makes economic exchange much more efficient than gift economies and barter economies, avoiding the inefficiencies of such systems like the “coincidence of wants” problem. ~ Money proved to be an efficient tool for comparing values of different goods and services. It has different functions and properties. It acts as a (i) medium of exchange; (ii) measure of value and unit of account in which debt can be denominated; and as a (iii) store of value. ~ Properties of money include (i) liquidity, (ii) fungibility, (iii) durability, (iv) portability, (v) cognizability, and (vi) stability. It also needs some (vii) inbuilt anti-counterfeiting measures to avoid forging. Different types of money have evolved over time. ~ In modern economies, the dominant type of money is so-called (i) fiat currency. Prior to the existence of modern day fiat currencies, we had (ii) commodity money and (iii) representative money. ~ Protocol tokens like Bitcoin or Ether are needed to pay for transactions in their respective networks. They represent the “legal tender” of the network, which is needed to pay for network services. The Bitcoin network is a public infrastructure for “P2P remittances.” Transaction fees for these remittances need to be paid with BTC tokens. ~ As of today, most tokens do not fulfill one of the most important properties of money: stability of value, and to some extent, also fungibility. Usability and scalability are other entry barriers to potential mass adoption. ~ Cryptographic tokens represent a new heterogenous asset class that can fulfill a diverse range of economic functions. Their frictionless issuance and settlement process could potentially convert many assets or access rights of the real world into “bankable funds.” ~ It is likely that tokenizing economic activities, from real assets to digital assets and all types of access rights, will impact the role of central bank money as a geographical monopolist providing a medium of exchange in the long run. ~ Cryptographic tokens represent a new heterogenous asset class that can fulfill a diverse range of economic functions. Their frictionless issuance and settlement process could potentially convert many assets or access rights of the real world into “bankable funds.” ~ Tokenizing economic activities, from real assets to digital assets and all types of access rights, could impact the role of central bank money as a geographical monopolist providing a medium of exchange, once mass adoption of the Web3 manifests and necessary network effects kick in. Such tokenization of the real economy could also lead to the merging of the financial stems with the real economy. ~ The term “DeFi” encompasses any decentralized and permissionless financial application that builds on top of distributed ledgers, including privacy-preserving payment systems (privacy tokens), stability preserving payment systems (stable tokens), P2P exchanges (token exchanges), P2P fundraising (token sales), and P2P credit and lending (decentralized lending), P2P insurance, and a growing list of P2P derivatives. These Web3-based DeFi applications could, potentially, open traditional financial services to the general public, mitigating current inefficiencies of financial markets. ~ Combining various DeFi solutions, such as “stable tokens,” “decentralized exchanges,” and “decentralized lending,” can produce completely new products available to retail investors and the general public and could, in the long run, change the dynamics of our economic system and contribute to the merging of the real economy and the financial system, making their distinction increasingly impossible. ~ (Location 3387)

Stable Tokens Stability of value is one of the most important functions of money so it can fulfill its purpose as a unit of account. Stable tokens are designed to represent a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account that has a stable value against another currency or commodity, and could resolve a major bottleneck to mass adoption of tokens as a medium of exchange.

State-of-the-art protocol tokens are currently impractical for day-to-day payments (at least in countries with stable inflation rates) and only attractive to speculators or long-time investors. Token values are volatile for several reasons: (i) a static monetary policy as a result of a token supply that does not adjust to price levels, (ii) shifting public perception about the value of the token, (iii) the fact that they represent assets in an emerging market that most people don’t understand, and potentially also (iv) market reaction to regulatory uncertainty.

Without stability mechanisms, smart contracts and decentralized applications will stay a fringe phenomena, as they would pose a high risk for both parties to a smart contract, the buyer and the seller. Over the years, various attempts have been made to achieve token stability: (i) fiat-collateralized or commodity-collateralized stable tokens, (ii) crypto-collateralized stable tokens, and (iii) algorithmic stable tokens, like seigniorage shares. Lately (iv) central banks have started looking into tokenizing their currencies, as these already come with inbuilt price stability mechanisms. (Location 3523)

DAI is a stable token operated by MakerDAO. The price is pegged 1:1 to the USD. DAI is backed by ETH (and recently also some other tokens) that can be collateralized in a smart contract. It is considered the most promising crypto-collateralized stable token project. ETH token holders can deposit their tokens in a smart contract to generate DAI tokens. The smart contract locks the deposited ETH until the DAI tokens are paid back. The collateral token (ETH) is automatically released by the smart contract when all debts (DAI tokens) are paid back. Collateralizing ETH against DAI results in a debt position for DAI token holders, which is why the smart contract is referred to as a “collateralized debt position” (CDP). (Location 3581)

Algorithmic Stable Tokens Stable tokens that are pegged to assets using legacy financial services might seem simple and obvious at first sight, but could also be perceived as somewhat contrary to the spirit of the underlying decentralized technology. This is similar to how Yahoo and many other search engines of the early 1990s tried to make Internet content available by cataloging websites, just as you would catalogue books or magazines in the library. While these search engines were popular and intuitive in the early days of the Internet, they were not scalable at all, nor did they reflect the potential of the underlying technology. Eventually, algorithmic search, as offered by Google and other companies, replaced manually cataloguing content. Similarly, asset-backed stable tokens might seem tempting at first, but some interesting algorithmic solutions are on the rise that might do more justice to the nature of smart contracts.

Chapter Summary ~ Stability of value is one of the most important functions of money to serve as a unit of account. The aim of stable tokens is to provide a stable value against the price of another asset. ~ Bitcoin’s protocol introduced a groundbreaking consensus algorithm, but the protocol defines only a rudimentary monetary policy that simply regulates and limits the amount of tokens minted over time. The protocol does not provide price stability.~ State-of-the-art protocol tokens are impractical for day-to-day payments. Without a stable medium of exchange, no party to a smart contract can rely on the price denominated of a certain token. This lack of price stability has led to the emergence of stable tokens over the last few years. ~ Just as developing a secure consensus algorithm required decades of research and development, an equivalent amount of academic rigor is required to develop monetary policy aspects of tokens. There is a lot one can learn from macroeconomics and decades of experience with monetary policies set by governments and central banks trying to achieve currency stability, both the dos and the don’ts.

Types of stable tokens: (i) asset-backed stable tokens; (ii) collateralized stable tokens; (iii) Central Bank Digital Currencies, and (iv) algorithmic stable tokens. ~ Stable tokens are indispensable building blocks for a thriving token economy; otherwise, smart contracts and decentralized applications will stay a fringe phenomena, as they pose a high risk for both parties to a smart contract, the buyer and the seller. ~ Businesses are not likely to accept tokens on a large scale if their value can drastically drop within a short amount of time, or if there are no other ways to mitigate this risk. ~ Stable tokens may not be the only solution to token price volatility. Insurances or financial derivatives could provide alternatives or at least complementary methods to mitigating price volatility. Hedging is an investment strategy that can be used to reduce financial risk, balancing positions in the market to protect against price volatilities. A combination of DeFi applications could be used to create such P2P derivative and hedging solutions. ~ (Location 3700)

Privacy Tokens Early blockchain networks provide a high level of transparency, which makes the history of a token visible to anyone. This compromises the privacy of token holders and also makes a token less fungible. Alternative token systems have, therefore, set out to create more privacy-preserving protocols. ~ (Location 3837)

Chapter Summary ~ A payment token is only useful as a medium of exchange if it satisfies the fungibility criteria. Fungibility refers to the fact that individual units of a token are equal, and can be substituted with each other. The level of fungibility correlates with the level of privacy/anonymity a token provides. This requires both “non-individualization” (obfuscating the traceability with identifiable individuals) and intransparency of other data related to transaction flows. ~ Analogue forms of money, like coins or bills, do not give any information about the transaction history, as there is no economically feasible way to track a list of the previous owners. Cash can be considered as the most anonymous and most fungible form of money. While state-issued money, in the form of cash, allows for a high degree of privacy and therefore also fungibility, cash is being less commonly used in modern economies for daily payments and has been replaced with electronic forms of money. ~ Electronic records have reduced the costs of monitoring how we use our money with simple algorithms. Furthermore, increasing anti-money laundering (AML) regulation and efforts by taxation authorities have forced financial institutions worldwide to monitor, and sometimes even reveal, information about the financial activities of their clients. Such practices, as a result of regulatory impositions, are gradually eroding the fungibility and hence quality of money. ~ The Bitcoin network and similar public and permissionless networks use asymmetric cryptography to create online identities in the form of blockchain addresses. This way, a user can create multiple addresses without KYC requirements while trustfully sending and receiving tokens via a public network. ~ Privacy of nodes can only be guaranteed as long as the real-world identity of a wallet owner cannot be linked to a certain network address. The publicly verifiable nature of blockchain networks makes transactions traceable, since all transactions are registered in plaintext (unencrypted) to the ledger, and transaction data is visible to anyone using a block explorer and can therefore be linked to other transactions made by the same token holder. ~ Public disclosure of one’s blockchain addresses, either via social media or as a result of one’s activity on a token exchange, makes users susceptible to de-anonymization efforts using data analysis. Metadata from token * transactions can be used to trace the IP address of a user, sometimes even when anonymization services such as Tor or I2P are used. ~ Depending on a token’s provenance, individual tokens may not be accepted by merchants due to their tainted transaction history. This reduces the fungibility of a token. ~ More recent blockchain networks have set out to improve the level of privacy of token transactions. Such “privacy tokens” use various obfuscating techniques to make token history less transparent. The goal of privacy tokens is to design a protocol that reveals the minimum information needed and obfuscates all other information. ~ Depending on the blockchain protocol, various elements of a transaction can be anonymized to different extents: (i) wallet/address anonymity, (ii) confidentiality of transaction data like payment amounts, (iii) privacy about total network state. User privacy (full anonymity): the identity of the user sending or receiving a token is obfuscated in such a way that the user’s actions cannot be linked to their real-world identity. ~ Over the past decade, a growing list of projects have been experimenting with a range of methods, from transaction aggregation to alternative cryptographic algorithms. ~ Depending on the level of obfuscation techniques implemented, or lack thereof, blockchain networks can either become liberation machines (more privacy by design), or effective surveillance and execution machines (no privacy by design). ~ Even when privacy, and the right to encryption, are explicitly regulated, the trade-off between individual privacy and public interest is subject to political viewpoints. It is often a matter of human discretion decided by judges, and regulated and enforced with great variation depending on the governance philosophy of a country or a community of nation states. The trade-offs between public and private interests are subject to ongoing public discussions and treated differently by governments worldwide. (Location 4069)

Chapter Summary ~ A token can only be managed by one type of network and cannot natively move between networks for interoperability reasons. The buying and selling of tokens therefore requires the services of token exchanges. They resemble online banks that take the tokens of their clients into their custody and manage the trading of tokens between users of their platforms. ~ Most exchanges today are centralized exchanges (CEX) performing intermediary services between buyers and sellers of tokens. They allow simple buying and selling of tokens, also against fiat currencies, and provide easy wallet creation and token management, including the safeguarding of private keys. ~ Token exchanges get to decide whether they include a token or not. They  act as trusted intermediaries and market makers have become the new gatekeepers in this emerging tokenized economy.  While they are an important player in this new token economy, they are still predominantly centralized, which makes them vulnerable to hacks, mismanagement, volume volatility, or censorship. Atomic swaps and decentralized exchanges try to mitigate these risks. ~ Atomic swaps allow for P2P cross-chain trading and can be directly executed between separate blockchains, wallet to wallet, without a trusted intermediary like exchanges. They use a type of smart contract called a hash time-locked contract (HTLC) to secure the transaction, making sure that both parties to the trade fulfill the requirements. ~ Atomic swaps do not resolve the “coincidence of wants” problem. They only benefit people who know another person who is willing to buy the exact amount of tokens at exactly the same time. ~ Decentralized exchanges (DEX) are decentralized applications running on a distributed ledger to allow users to trade tokens without the need for an institution clearing the settlements. The trade is settled directly by the ledgers (on-chain). They combine atomic swaps with matching algorithms to mitigate the coincidence-of-wants problem. ~ A fully decentralized exchange would make use of atomic swaps, or similar methods, with an added discovery layer that enables trading between two random token owners who do not know each other, might live in different countries, and would not otherwise know how to find each other.

Lending Tokens - Decentralized Credit Systems Decentralized lending services use smart contracts to create two-sided markets for  a P2P credit and lending system.

While P2P lending protocols create exciting new possibilities, the scene is still nascent. At the time of writing this book, decentralized lending services cannot compete with legacy financial systems: (i) many services are not fully decentralized yet, (ii) missing regulation, and (iii) not stress tested processes, which make smart contract exploits possible, and have (iv) limited usability and unintuitive user experience (control of their own private key), (v) low liquidity of decentralized exchanges, and (vi) many DeFi products are still over-collateralized as a result of missing credit scoring or shared collateral.

Chapter Summary ~ Smart contract–based execution of credit and lending services have lower operational costs than legacy financial services, as compliance verification could be executed on the fly. In a fully decentralized setup, P2P financial services only require a crypto-wallet, without complex identification systems. They allow for more control, security, and inclusion. ~ Decentralized lending services use smart contracts to create two-sided markets for  a P2P credit and lending system. Any non-bankable asset such as commodities, securities, real estate, artworks, or SME shares could, in theory, be tokenized and collateralized, which could lead to a convergence of financial markets and the real economy. Commodities, national currencies, and securities are already being tokenized and can be traded on markets today, while tokenized real estate, art, and SME shares are still in their early stages of conceptualization. ~ The integrations of such tokenized non-bankable assets with lending and borrowing schemes would allow for instant transactions, which surpasses the possibilities of the legacy systems we have today. Any transferable tokens representing an asset could be used as collateral for open decentralized lending solutions, which could change the dynamics of our global economic system. ~ P2P lending could easily be brokered by a smart contract. Dormant and previously non-bankable assets from around the world can now be tokenized to create a liquid P2P lending market. Anyone can earn passive income relatively risk free on their token holdings through interest paid by the borrowers. On the other hand, lower operational costs could also make loans more affordable for a wider array of people and institutions. ~ P2P borrowing allows for the borrowing of funds against a collateral of tokens you own, potentially paying lower interest rates than in the current financial system. Previously non-bankable assets, such as commodities, securities, art, or real estate, can be tokenized and leveraged against (i) fiat money or other (ii) transferable crypto-tokens. Borrowers can lock up tokens they own as collateral in a smart contract. This collateral serves as a guarantee that the lenders will be repaid. ~ Since most tokens have volatile prices, decentralized lending applications only let you borrow a certain percentage of the value of your collateral. If the market price of the collateral begins to drop, the smart contract is programmed to sell collateral tokens at a pre-defined spot price or a market auction to mitigate counterparty risk of the lender. ~ Flash Loans Flash loans are a specific type of P2P loan that is valid within one transaction and must be repaid by the end of that transaction. The lender can offer loans at zero-risk and the borrower can get any amount of tokens, without a collateral, provided the borrower can return all tokens borrowed within the same transaction. A series of smart contract operations can be programmed in a way that either all occur, or nothing occurs. ~ Flash Attacks Flash attacks refer to capital-intensive attack vectors on decentralized financial services enabled by flash loans. Flash loan borrowers can leverage almost unlimited amounts of funds to profit from arbitrage possibilities by coding all the steps into the same smart contract, and profit by borrowing tokens at a low price, then selling at a higher price before repaying the loan. This whole process can be performed within the same transaction, on-chain. ~ In the current financial industry, such market manipulation can only be conducted by individuals or institutions with many assets. In a way, flash loans democratize market manipulation. ~ (Location 4594)

Token Sales: ICOs, ITOs, IEOs, STOs In a token sale, smart contracts are used to issue cryptographic tokens in exchange for existing tokens entirely P2P. As opposed to native blockchain tokens that are minted upon successful mining of a block (Proof-of-Work), for individual contributions to the network to keep it safe, token sales introduced a static mechanism for issuing tokens against a direct financial fee, often even before the project is operational. ~ (Location 4704)

It is important to point out that the Bitcoin blockchain never had a token sale, and that Bitcoin tokens are continuously minted each time a block of transactions is created (read more: Part 1 - Bitcoin, Blockchain, & other DLTs, Part 4 - Purpose-Driven Tokens). As opposed to native blockchain tokens that are issued upon Proof-of-Work, and incentivize individual contributions to the network to keep it safe, token sales introduced a static mechanism for issuing tokens against a direct financial fee, before the project becomes operational. Tokens would be created only once, before the launch of the project, and issued to investors. In such a setup, a certain portion of the token supply, or the entire token supply, is released before the launch of a project, in many cases even before any code is written.   ￼ (Location 4727)

Chapter Summary ~ Token sales allow the issuance of cryptographic tokens in exchange for existing tokens, entirely P2P. They became popular with the advent of the Ethereum network. Anyone can issue and sell tokens with a smart contract. ~ These first token sales were referred to as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), but as the term “token” became more mainstream, token offerings or ITOs (Initial Token Offerings), and in the specific cases of securities, STOs (Security Token Offering), became the term of the hour. ~ Token sales introduced a static mechanism for issuing tokens against a direct financial fee, before the project becomes operational. Tokens would be created only once, before the launch of the project, and issued to investors. In such a setup, a certain portion of the token supply, or the entire token supply, is released before the launch of a project, in many cases even before any code is written. ~ In the early days of token sales, due to lack of explicit regulation, many developers assumed that they had total freedom on how to conduct those token sales. Different approaches were experimented with. The most distinguishing factor of which was the price curve of the token throughout the different stages of the sale: (i) price increase; (ii) price decrease; (iii) fixed price; and (iv) undetermined price. ~ Token sales can be issued at a fixed price throughout the duration of the sale. The exchange rate could also increase over the duration of the sale, so early stage investors get a better price (risk discount) than later stage investors. Other options include Dutch auctions, where the token sale starts at the highest price per token, and decreases with time. Furthermore, a token sale can issue a fixed amount of tokens, or an unlimited amount of tokens. A token sale might be conducted in a way where tokens are distributed as a percentage of total funds raised. ~ As new token sale mechanisms and third-party service providers are entering the market, token exchanges have started to offer their platforms for fundraising purposes. Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) are intermediary services where token issuers can raise funds by offering their token on a token exchange, instead of offering the tokens directly on their website. ~ In an IEO, the token exchange provides the infrastructure, including the KYC process, and supervises the token sale. Token issuers send the tokens to the exchange, which then sells the tokens to investors in exchange for other tokens or fiat money. Issuers of tokens can reduce the organizational overheads and bureaucracy related to registering for a token sale with regulatory authorities and leverage the existing user base of the token exchange, reducing marketing efforts. ~ IEOs offer a convenient way to conduct a token sale, while automatically listing the token for future trading on that exchange. This reduces the risk of never getting one’s tokens listed.  Initial Exchange Offerings also provide more flexibility for investors, since they are not forced to pay with one particular token, but could potentially pay with any of the tokens they have already deposited on that exchange. ~ (Location 4850)

Part 4: Token Use Cases ~ This part will deep-dive into a selection of token use cases and industries that might be disrupted as a result of tokenization. While some of the outlined use cases are already operational, many are still in a conceptual phase. To cover a range of topics, each chapter has been kept compact, describing the issues at hand on a high level. For a deep-dive, the references at the end of each chapter might be useful for further reading on each topic. The last chapter will give a practical guideline on how to design your own token system.

Chapter Summary ~ Asset tokens allow the creation of a digital representative for physical assets or securities. They are the next step in the automation of the securities and asset markets, replacing entire back offices with smart contracts. ~ The tokenization of an existing asset refers to the process of creating a tokenized digital twin for any physical object or financial asset. The token hereby represents the physical counterpart, collectively managed by a distributed ledger. ~ “Asset token” is a general term that can include any assets, such as commodities, artwork, real estate, or securities. “Security tokens” are a specific type of asset tokens that are classified as securities under financial market regulations. The interpretation of what constitutes a security, however, is subject to local legislation. ~ Security tokens provide a new form of representation, management, and distribution of existing securities. Paying out dividends could be conducted with a smart contract and on the fly, which is an upgrade for state-of-the-art financial settlement systems. From a regulator’s point of view, these tokens are traditional securities that are simply represented and managed by a new technology. They are not a new product, and therefore are fairly easy to regulate. ~ Asset tokens are to financial markets what social media was to the publishing industry. They are much more likely to revolutionize our economy, and security tokens are the gateway drug to get there. ~ From a legal perspective, tokenization of (rights to) a physical asset and other (virtual) rights seems important. Tools that aim to represent virtual assets (such as paper certificates and other digital certificates) are likely to be substituted by tokens soon; for physical assets, possession seems likely to remain the most important link. ~ Depending on the regulatory environment and how the smart contract is set up, asset tokens may be eligible for global trading. Opening up global markets adds even more liquidity and provides new opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors alike. This trend might make it feasible to buy shares of assets in foreign countries that were previously much more difficult to obtain. ~ Smart contracts have the potential to facilitate rights management in the real estate industry, including the whole settlement process. Once real estate ownership is tokenized, it can be easily registered and managed on a public infrastructure and traded P2P, if it complies with regulation. The hashed data of each property could be recorded on a distributed ledger to provide a universally shared data set on all real estate–related activities, such as previous owner, repairs conducted, and amenities.   Tokens could either be issued for existing real estate or for a real estate project under development. ~ In order to tokenize a real asset like an apartment, one generates a token with a smart contract, and associates a value of the real asset with that token. The ownership right in such an asset and its corresponding digital representation can be divided into parts and sold to several (co-)owners. Even if a token represents a physical asset that is not divisible, like a piece of art or real estate, the token itself is divisible. ~ One prerequisite for tokenizing real estate would be that the legal process of the real estate market is made Web3 compatible, from the land registry process to the general regulatory environment accepting smart contract processes. ~ Tokenizing the art and entertainment market could, potentially, resolve many of the inefficiencies of the current systems, from fractional ownership, provenance, digital rights management, and settlement to crowdfunding. Tokens could also enable new derivative artworks. ~ Asset markets, such as fine art or real estate, that usually have high economic buy-ins can be tokenized and fractionalized, potentially generating new use cases that were not feasible before. Instead of investing millions of Euros for an art piece, one can now buy a fraction of a painting. This allows for increased market depth and liquidity. ~ Any physical good or share in a small- or medium-sized enterprise can also be tokenized at a fraction of what it would cost in the client-server world and divided into representative tokens, which could be traded on an open market. ~ (Location 5166)

Purpose-Driven Tokens Purpose-driven tokens incentivize individual behavior to contribute to a collective goal. This collective goal might be a public good or the reduction of negative externalities to a common good. Purpose-driven tokens introduce a new form of collective value creation without traditional intermediaries. They provide an alternative to the conventional economic system, which predominantly incentivizes individual value creation in the form of private goods. (Location 5288)

Token Curated Registries (TCRs) are a cryptoeconomic mechanism designed to incentivize the collective curation of public lists or content feeds in a social network. The collective goal is a useful and high-quality list. Tokens are used to provide an economic incentive to curate the ranking of information in such a list. The mechanism of a TCR aims to align token holder incentives in order to produce lists that are valuable to consumers and provide a reliable signal of quality on something a user cannot directly observe. Each list has its own native token (read more: Part 4 - TCRs). (Location 5327)

They might be designed to expire after a while, or have unlimited durability. “Vienna Kultur-Token,” “Sweatcoin,” or “Changers” incentivize riding a bike, walking, or using public transportation instead of using a car. Other projects incentivize the production or consumption of renewable energies such as “Solar Coin,” “Electric Chain,” and “Sun Exchange.” Alternatively, people could be incentivized with a token every time they prove that they have used less energy by using energy-efficient devices, or turning the lights off, as in the case of “Energi Mine” or “Electron.” One could also be incentivized for planting trees (Proof-of-Tree-Planted), or cleaning a beach (Proof-of-Bottles-Recycled), reduction of food waste, and many more. Some examples of which are: “Plastic Bank,” “Earth Dollar,” “Bit Seeds,” “Eco Coin,” “Earth Token,” and “Recycle To Coi.” (Location 5335)

Public Goods & the Tragedy of the Commons In economics, the term “public goods” refers to goods that any individual can use without paying for them (non-excludable, or permissionless), and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others (non-rivalrous, or unlimited). Public goods that satisfy both conditions only to a certain extent are referred to as impure public goods. (Location 5362)

The creation of private goods often leads to “negative externalities” to common goods, like the environment. Such negative externalities are regulated by local, national, and international organizations, with laws (mostly negative incentives), taxation (negative incentives except tax break legislation), nudging (positive incentives), and privatization (market mechanisms).

Behavioral economics is a field of economics that studies the economic decision process of individuals and institutions that are impacted by other factors than economic rationality. Psychological, emotional, cultural, cognitive, and social factors are also taken into account, with the conclusion that people make over 90 percent of their decisions based on mental shortcuts or “rules of thumb.” (Location 5418)

Cognitive Psychology & Behavioral Analysis Tokenized incentives are not a new thing and have been experimented with in psychology to condition behavior. In psychology, the term “token economy” refers to a type of behavior modification program using operant conditioning, which was described by A.E. Kazdin in 1977. In behavioral analysis, the term “operant conditioning” refers to a learning process through which behavior is modified by reinforcement (Location 5432)

Applied methods are game theory, experimental economics, and experimental psychology, which all study the paradoxes in decision making by participants in a game. It provides alternatives for traditional decision-making models, such as “regret theory,” “hyperbolic discounting,” and “prospect theory.” For example, people might want to minimize the feeling of regret after having made a decision, and therefore might assess their options based on how much regret they might suffer due to the outcome of their strategies.

Mechanism Design & Token Engineering The design of consensus protocols is related to a sub-field of economics called “mechanism design,” which deals with the question of how to design a game that incentivizes everyone to contribute to a collective goal. Mechanism design theory uses economic incentives in combination with cryptography. The aim is to achieve a desired goal in a strategic setting where it is assumed that all players act rationally. It is also referred to as “reverse game theory,” since it starts at the end of the game, then goes backward when designing the mechanism. Hurwicz, Maskin, and Myerson were awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in economics for their research on Mechanism Design. (Location 5473)

“Token engineering” is an emerging term with a more interdisciplinary approach that was coined by Trent McConaghy in his article, “Towards a Practice of Token Engineering.” He defines token engineering as the theory, practice, and tools to analyze, design, and verify tokenized ecosystems. He draws similarities between creating token mechanisms and electrical engineering, swarm robotics, operations research, software engineering, civil engineering, aerospace engineering, complex systems design, public policy design, specific economics, robotics, machine learning, and AI.

Economics and mathematics, and even engineering disciplines, have already developed various models and approaches to formalize economic motives and mannerisms of rational agents, which have been and still are being used by national governments, regulators, and institutions. The question to resolve is whether and to what extent these economic models can be applied in the context of token-driven ecosystems. This can be done by (i) identifying similarities between token economics and existing scientific fields of economics, but also robotics, automation, and control engineering, which also provide methods to work despite uncertainty. There is also much to learn from Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), which control power grids that represent decentralized physical infrastructure with varying environmental conditions and decentralized strategic agent behavior on the part of the power consumers.

While Ethereum and similar protocols have made it possible to create any type of token with a few lines of code, using a simple smart contract that runs on a public infrastructure, we still (i) lack archetypical building blocks and standards, also referred to as “cryptoeconomic primitives”75; (ii) We also lack the necessary modeling and forecasting tools to design the governance functionalities of those tokens, especially for more complex types of purpose-driven tokens that intend to auto-incentivize some kind of behavior in a network of autonomous agents; (iii) (Location 5507)

While a lot of tokens have been issued through token sales over the last few years—mostly for fundraising purposes—most of these issued tokens lack proper functionality and mechanism design. So far, there has been little overlap with the academic community studying this field and the developers of many “purpose-driven tokens.” The community of token issuers will be advised to use methods and findings from mechanism design when designing purpose-driven token protocols.

Chapter Summary ~ Purpose-driven tokens incentivize individual behavior to contribute to a collective goal. This collective goal might be a public good or the reduction of negative externalities to a common good. ~ Purpose, refers to the idea of a collective goal, in addition to maximizing one’s personal profit. ~ Web3 tokens are an easily programmable vehicle to model individual decision-making processes into a smart contract. Any purpose can be incentivized. Any behavior can be modeled. Examples of different types of purpose-driven tokens are: (i) incentivizing consensus on the state of a network; (ii) incentivizing social media contributions; (iii) incentivizing contributions to a listing; (iv) incentivize the collective curation of public lists or content feeds in a social network; or (v) incentivizing CO2 emission reduction. ~ Purpose-driven tokens provide an alternative to conventional economic systems, which predominantly incentivize individual value creation: private actors to extract rent from nature or from the workforce, and transform this into products, often externalizing costs to society, while internalizing (and maximizing) private profits. ~ The study of economics, public choice theory, theory of public goods, and behavioral sciences will be essential for a better understanding, and as a result, also a better design and engineering process of purpose-driven tokens. ~ The term “public good” refers to goods that any individual can use without paying for them (non-excludable, or permissionless), and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others (non-rivalrous, or unlimited). Public goods that satisfy both conditions only to a certain extent are referred to as impure public goods. ~ The Bitcoin payment network could be seen as a new form of tech-driven public good, albeit an impure one. Upkeep and maintenance of the network is collective and permissionless. Usage of the network is permissionless and non-rivalrous, but only as long as capacity limits are not reached. In their current form, public blockchain networks don’t scale well and can be considered as rivalrous when the network becomes clogged. ~ Public goods tend to be subject to free-rider problems, where some individuals consume a public good without (sufficiently) contributing to their creation or maintenance. Open-source software is a public good that is typically subject to the free-rider problems. The Bitcoin protocol is also a good example for this free-rider problem, as only a few contribute to the code, with little or no direct incentive to do so, but many people use it. Tokenized social media networks or token curated registries also face many free-rider problems that need to be anticipated when designing the token governance mechanisms. ~ If public goods become subject to restrictions, they become club goods or private goods. Exclusion mechanisms might be in the form of memberships, copyright, patents, or paywalls. Club goods represent artificially scarce goods. Permissioned ledgers could be seen as such club goods, where only members of the federation (club) have access to the distributed ledger and can write transactions to it. ~ The creation of private goods often leads to “negative externalities” to common goods, like the environment. Externalities in economics refers to the costs or benefits that affect a person or community, who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. “Negative externalities” are a result of activities of people and institutions that cause an indirect cost (negative effect) on other people or institutions. “Positive externalities” can arise if, for example, two neighboring farmers have positive ecological effects on each other. ~ Incentivizing CO2 emission reduction with a token is an example of a positive externality that could contribute to the wellbeing of a common good, like the air quality of a city. ~ Even though the collective production of public goods can result in positive externalities, it does not necessarily exclude other negative externalities. If not well designed, purpose-driven tokens can have positive and negative externalities: while Proof-of-Work is an essential mechanism for the maintenance of a public good, the act of Bitcoin mining itself is energy intense, producing negative externalities to society. ~ The current design of tokenized networks is faced with many "free-rider" and "tragedy of the commons problems" that need to be anticipated when designing the token governance mechanisms of these tokenized networks. ~ Current consensus mechanisms are based on the idea of a neoclassical economic theory and the concept of a rational economic actor - "homo economicus" - who reduces economic decision making to simple profit maximization based on an individual profit maximization and the idea of "perfect selfishness." While the idea of "perfect selfishness" and rationality assumptions might make sense in the context of blockchain protocols, as “consensus” isn't actually directly managed by humans and almost exclusively bot activity, such rationality assumptions might not make sense for the mechanism design of human behavior towards CO2 emission reductions, contributions to a social network, or contributions to a token curated list. ~ Alternative economic theories, such as behavioral economics, are based on the assumption that individual action is more complex. Behavioral economics is a field of economics that studies the economic decision process of individuals and institutions are impacted by other factors than economic rationality. ~ Tokenized incentives are not a new thing and have been experimented with in psychology to condition behavior. In psychology the term "token economy" refers to a type of behavior modification program using "operant conditioning," a learning process through which behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment. It studies the relationship between behavior and external stimulus or events that influence behavior. ~ Behavioral finance studies why market actors are economically "irrational" and resulting market inefficiencies such irrational behaviour and how others can profit from such (predictable) irrationality. Findings from behavioral finance are important aspects to consider when modelling purpose-driven tokens and DeFi market mechanisms, some of which are discussed ~ The design of purpose-driven tokens uses game theory to model human reasoning into an automated steering mechanism formalized by the protocol or smart contract and should account for the behavioural complexities. There is, furthermore, an entire class of games in the network science literature, called “network formation games” that cover everything from how academic citation and collaboration networks emerge, to Twitter graphs, etc. ~ The design of consensus protocols is related to a sub-field of economics called "mechanism design" which deals with the question of how to design a game that incentivizes everyone to contribute to a collective goal. It is also referred to as "reverse game theory" since it starts at the end of the game, then goes backward when designing the mechanism. ~ Not every token needs to be a product of cryptoeconomic mechanisms. Asset tokens such as security tokens can simply represent property rights or access rights utilizing simple smart contracts. Purpose-driven tokens, on the other hand, need purpose-oriented mechanisms. Token mechanisms design, also referred to as "token engineering," an emerging field. ~ The protocols that govern an autonomous network of actors, including their rules, agents, nodes, tokens, and governance structures, resemble nation states, not companies. One therefore needs to analyze tools that nation states use to model their agents’ behavior: macroeconomics, microeconomics, and specifically behavioral economics, behavioral finance, behavioral game theory, and some heterodox schools, like institutional economics, ecological economics, and complexity economics. ~ (Location 5516)

Token Economics of Steemit Decentralized social networks such as Steemit have (i) no data monopoly, meaning everyone has access to all transaction data, which is publicly visible on the Steem block explorer, and (ii) no advertising revenues are necessary, as the network is collectively managed by (iii) contributors who get rewarded with tokens for their contributions to the network. To find or tag content, one can use “tags and topics” that help sort content into individualized streams. (Location 5762)

Steem (STEEM) is the native token of the Steem blockchain. As with any native blockchain tokens, the tokens are transferable and new tokens are created every day. Steem Power (SP) is a reputation token designed to reflect one's influence in the social network. Anyone who opens a new account receives an initial amount of SP tokes. After that, one can be rewarded for contribution to the network in SP. Alternatively, SP can be bought with Steem at a 1:1 ratio. This process is referred to as “powering up.” The more SP one has, the more one’s contributions to the network are rewarded. If someone with a lot of SP upvotes a post of another user, that user will get rewarded with more tokens than they would receive if another user with less SP upvoted their content. SP can be converted back into Steem, which is referred to as powering down, but the process is intentionally slowed down to thirteen weeks to keep users from selling their tokens all at once to prevent price crashes and market manipulations. Steem Dollar (SBD) is designed as a stable token that is pegged to the US dollar in a 1:1 ratio. It can be bought on the open market or earned (fifty percent of the reward for contributions to the social media network are paid out in SBD). Once earned, these SBD tokens can be: (i) cashed out; (ii) held; or (iii) converted into Steem and then sold on the open market after a 3.5-day conversion process to avoid “arbitrage attacks.” Since SBD is designed to have a stable price, SBD token holders miss out on Steem price increases. To incentivize SBD token holders to hold onto their SBD, they receive 10 percent interest per year. This interest rate is variable and can be changed in a protocol upgrade. The Steemit network has three different types of users: (i) content creators: publish content; (ii) active users: curate content by upvoting (liking) the content, and (iii) passive users: consume content. A content creator can publish a post but will only get rewarded with tokens if and when the post is upvoted by other users (content curators). If a post performs well, a curator who upvoted this post will earn more SP than for upvoting a less popular post. Rewards are paid out from two reward pools and distributed in a mix of the different tokens, Steem Power and Steem Dollar, and this distribution is determined individually by the content creator. Rewards are only paid in the first seven days after content is posted. After that period, the post will still be online, but one will not be able to earn rewards with the post anymore. Anyone can post and upvote content, therefore contributing to the collective curation of content. The exact amount of tokens earned is a function of the number of upvotes a post receives, and also a function of the amount of Steem Power the curators making the upvotes have. If a curator has 2,000 Steem Power and another has 20,000 Steem Power, the effects of those two upvotes will be different. To incentivize quality content, the number of upvotes a user can perform within a certain period of time is limited. To add to the complexity, if the same user decides to upvote several posts, the weight of each vote will diminish, depending on how much time passes between votes. The network recharges voting power by 20 percent a day. (Location 5768)

Chapter Summary ~ Steemit is a decentralized social network where contributions to the network get rewarded with network tokens. It is a decentralized application that runs on the Steem blockchain. As opposed to Web2-based social media applications. ~ Decentralized social networks such as Steemit have no data monopoly, meaning everyone has access to all transaction data, which is publicly visible on the Steem block explorer, and no advertising revenues are necessary, as the network is collectively managed by contributors who get rewarded with tokens for their contributions to the network. How much you get paid is a function of the number of your contributions, and the popularity of your contributions. ~ Steemit has three different types of users: (a) content creators: publish content; (b) active users: curate content by upvoting (liking) the content, and (c) passive users: consume content. Users are rewarded for contributions to the network with three different types of network tokens: “Steem,” “Steem Dollar,” and “Steem Power.” ~ While Steemit and the underlying Steem blockchain infrastructure are a great use case for how we can redefine social networks, the economics behind the token design have a few fundamental design flaws. Due to the design flaws of the reputation token, there are currently many issues with incentivizing and providing quality content. While Steem Power (SP) was supposed to be a reputation token, it is based on oversimplified assumptions of how network actors behave. ~ The token mechanisms don’t take into account tragedy-of-the-commons or short-term economic thinking. Reputation tokens, in the form of Steem Power, can be bought with fiat money. Users who are willing to invest a considerable amount of money in Steem Power can, therefore, bootstrap their network power and earn more money more quickly than users who try to organically build up reputation. Furthermore, the design of the reputation token does not take into account that different users have different interests, and that individual tastes are relative. ~ The reality of the network activity has shown that the reward model very often encourages the creation of clickbait-style content driven by bots. While there is some bot prevention, related to the process of account creation, Steem Power is a transferable token, which means that it can be delegated from one user to another. This has led to the emergence of bots programmed to upvote posts based on their potential profitability. Bots can split the reward with the token holders that delegated their SP to them. Bots can upvote other bots to create circular feedback on profit expectations, taking into account that a vote is more profitable if it’s cast relatively early, and in a case that more votes will follow. ~ Steemit allows users to self-upvote one’s own posts, and this has been subject to many discussions in the network. Opponents criticize the bias in the act of self-upvoting, as it reduces the quality of the curation process. Proponents say that not upvoting your own content means diluting your own stake, and giving your power only to other users. Furthermore, they argue that if users want to self-upvote and are no longer able to, they will simply create a second account. ~ As opposed to Web2 social media platforms, all transaction data on the Steemit blockchain is public and transparent to everyone with simple chain-analysis. This means that anyone can inspect what happened when or who did what in the Steemit ecosystem. Alternative cryptographic algorithms like multiparty computation or zero-knowledge proofs and additional obfuscation techniques need to be implemented in the protocol to provide more privacy by design. ~ In March 2020 there was a hostile takeover and a contentious hard fork where the community forked into a new network called “Hive.” ~ New competitors, such as “Akasha,” “all.me,” “Belacam,” “DLive,” “E-chat,” “Golos” “Minds,” “Mithril,” “5media,” “Social X,” or “UUNIO,” might provide more resilient token economics in the years to come. ~ (Location 5924)

Basic Attention Metrics (BAM) allows for the accurate tracking and reporting of user attention directly in the browser. In spite of the fact that the browser constantly tracks one’s attention, this data is anonymized, as it never leaves the browser software locally running on one’s device. In-device machine-learning algorithms determine relevant content for personalized advertising. The “attention value” for each ad depends on how long the ad is viewed and other metrics such as the number of ad pixels that are visible in proportion to relevant content, etc. (Location 6111)

Chapter Summary ~ The Basic Attention Token provides tokenized solutions to current challenges of the advertising industry, reinventing the way users, publishers, and advertisers interact. It redefines the question of who owns your attention and your web browsing experience, and who gets paid for what from whom. They use tokenized incentives and a privacy-preserving browser application to create a decentralized ad exchange. ~ The “Brave” browser is a decentralized application that communicates with the Ethereum network, which manages two tokens: BAT (Basic Attention Token) and BAM (Basic Attention Metrics). ~ The BAT token can be used as a transfer of value between publishers, advertisers, and users in a way that (i) users are compensated for viewing ads in a privacy-preserving manner, (ii) publishers receive a bigger stake of the ad revenue than they would today, and (iii) advertisers could gain a better return on investment, as well as more accurate data. Users can opt to see certain ads from companies they are genuinely interested in, or pay a fee to not see any advertisements at all. Advertising is performed P2P, directly in the users in the wallet & browser. ~ Basic Attention Metrics (BAM) allows for the accurate tracking and reporting of user attention directly in the browser. In-device machine-learning algorithms determine relevant content for personalized advertising. Data analysis is performed directly on the browser for the sake of serving targeted advertising without revealing the base data to the company that delivers the ad (advertiser). Advertisers have direct access to trustful metrics without the need for third-party tracking and without compromising the privacy of the user. ~ In spite of the fact that the browser constantly tracks one’s attention, this data is anonymized, as it never leaves the browser software locally running on one’s device. Users maintain ownership and control over their data. ~ Web3-based advertising solutions provide more transparency for the publishers without compromising the privacy of the user. Due to the open-source nature of this solution, the browser software can be audited, and all transactions are publicly verifiable. The open-source nature could make the systems more resilient and reduce fraud. ~ When delivering an ad, the advertisers send BAT tokens in a locked state using a smart contract. If and when users view the ads, the smart contract unlocks the BAT tokens, which compensate the user with up to 70 percent of the advertising revenue. The publisher hosting the advertisement receives the rest, which could incentivize them to deliver relevant quality content instead of random spamming with irrelevant ads. ~ Users can get compensated for their time and attention, and in turn, spend these tokens for other online activities, such as tipping artists and content creators for their free online content. BAT tokens can also be used for charity donations to thrid-party organizations. ~ (Location 6173)

Listings and registries have proven to be a useful tool to organize, rank, and share information. We use lists for our daily decision-making processes, such as “best books,” “best restaurants,” “top universities,” “tokens to invest in,” “best movies,” “best classic movies,” “best horror movies,” “best rated products of a certain category of an e-commerce platform,” “best budget or luxury hotel in a region.” (Location 6275)

How TCRs Work Token Curated Registries (TCRs) are a market mechanism introduced by Mike Goldin for collectively curating lists in the absence of third-party coordination. Tokens provide an economic incentive to curate lists that are valuable to consumers. Transactions are settled and cleared autonomously by a distributed ledger. TCRs are designed to represent a public good. Anyone can participate. (Location 6307)

It is advised that TCRs divide the voting process into two phases, the commit phase and the reveal phase. Results are only openly broadcasted after the commit phase is completed to avoid “coordination attacks,” where one curator could have influence over the voting process of other curators. Tokens are locked in the commit phase and unlocked during the reveal phase. (Location 6320)

It is assumed that each list needs their own token to give a reliable signal of the quality of the list and the value of the network. The price of a token is a result of supply and demand, and as such, assumed to be a performance indicator for the collective actions of all token holders. If a TCR would accept a non-native token as a means of payment, such as BTC or ETH, the collective performance of the token holders would not reflect performance of the list and the economic incentive mechanisms would therefore not work.

Mechanism Design: The incentive mechanism needs to align incentives in a way to make sure that it pays off for token holders to vote truthfully, and that it does not pay to cheat the system. Candidates who believe they will be rejected are not likely to apply; otherwise, they would lose their tokens. Token holders, on the other hand, could theoretically reject every candidate, but that would collide with their interest to increase the value of their tokens. An empty list is not interesting for anyone. Profitability and quality of all stakeholders need to be well-aligned, so that objective and high-quality lists can be produced. (Location 6327)

Consumers, on the other hand, seek high-quality information and use lists to make decisions. If the quality of the listing is good, consumers will be interested in consulting the listing, which will make it more attractive for candidates to apply to be listed and strengthens the overall economy of that list.

Attack Vectors The economics behind the registry needs to be designed in a way that it accounts for all possible attack vectors. A number of attack vectors have been identified, such as “trolling,” “madman attacks,” “registry poisoning,” or “coin flipping.” A solution to each of these potential attacks needs to be reflected in the governance rules of the TCR to guarantee high-quality listings.

However, critics argue that TCRs that use token-weighted votes (i) cannot provide nuanced curation, (ii) cannot replace subjective reputation systems, and (iii) have a problem with “minimum economy” size. They claim that having a stake in a system alone cannot build quality curation, as token holders are more likely to maximize short-term profits, since they can sell their tokens any time and exit the system, which is harmful to the collective quality of the list in the long run. Furthermore, any TCR will need a minimum market size to resist manipulation attempts, which means that new lists have a chicken-and-egg problem. (Location 6369)

While the classic proposal of TCRs might have limited use cases, the emergence of more complex and sophisticated proposals is an interesting phenomenon to follow. More and more projects are starting to implement aspects of various TCR proposals in their token design. “Relevant” is building a reputation protocol that combines subjective criteria with TCRs. They want to use this to build a fake news–resistant social news reader, using token-backed qualitative metrics, valuing quality over clicks. (Location 6423)

Chapter Summary ~ Online lists and recommendation engines use (i) machine learning algorithms and (ii) wisdom of the crowd mechanisms to derive meaningful lists, rankings and recommendations. Such lists or registries can be private or public and are usually centrally managed. Whitelists or blacklists are used to filter relevant information and saves the users time researching and filtering information themselves. Third-party curation, however, is prone to censorship and manipulation, as they are centrally managed. ~ The curation tasks involve managing and maintaining data feeds, filtering comments, or providing context-specific recommendations. Machine-learning algorithms derive their suggestions by correlating personalized user data with statistical data of the behavior of all other users. Their methods are, for the most part, undisclosed, resulting in intransparent filtering algorithms. ~ Token Curated Registries provide a tokenized market mechanism for collectively curating lists in the absence of third-party coordination and centralized list management. Tokens are used as economic incentives to perform curation tasks. Transactions are settled and cleared autonomously by a distributed ledger. ~ TCRs are designed to represent a public good. Anyone can participate. In order to set up a TCR, one needs to (i) define a purpose for the list, (ii) a native token, and (iii) a governance mechanism that makes sure that all token holders are incentivized to maintain a high-quality list. ~ The stakeholders are (i) candidates provide content for the list, (ii) consumers use the list, and (iii) curators collectively manage the quality of the list  (token holders). ~ Candidates have to deposit a certain amount of tokens to apply for the list. Any token holder can participate in the curation process, and has a certain time to cast a vote on whether or not the candidate's application should be included in the list. To do so, they must make a deposit of a certain amount of tokens into a smart contract, locking a part of their network stake. ~ If at the end of the voting period, the application is rejected by the majority of token holders, the applicant’s deposit is split between the challenger and all other token holders who voted to reject the application. Otherwise the listing of the candidate is added to the registry, and the smart contract distributes the challenger’s deposit between the applicant and all token holders who voted for accepting the listing. ~ Candidates who believe they will be rejected are not likely to apply; otherwise, they would lose their tokens. Token holders, on the other hand, could theoretically reject every candidate, but that would collide with their interest to increase the value of their tokens. An empty list is not interesting for anyone. Profitability and quality of all stakeholders need to be well-aligned, so that objective and high-quality lists can be produced. ~ The price of a token is a result of supply and demand, and as such, assumed to be a performance indicator for the collective actions of all token holders. If a TCR would accept a non-native token as a means of payment, the collective performance of the token holders would not reflect performance of the list and the economic incentive mechanisms would therefore not work. ~ The vote of token holders is proportional to the number of tokens they own, or stake. Proportional voting rights are based on the idea that those who have the most at stake are most incentivized to act in the network’s best interest. ~ A number of attack vectors have been identified, such as “trolling,” “madman attacks,” “registry poisoning,” or “coin flipping.” A solution to each of these potential attacks needs to be reflected in the governance rules of the TCR to guarantee high-quality curation. ~ TCR can only be successful if (i) an objective answer to the listing question exists and if (ii) the answer is publicly observable. Subjective questions cannot be accurately answered by an objective mechanism. Lists that are prone to subjective tastes or opinions need a stronger coordination signal, which would require a well-defined set of curators with well-aligned values. Combining TCRs with social reputation systems could add necessary context to a TCR might resolve this problem, and mitigate some attack vectors of classic TCRs. ~ Alternative proposals to objective and subjective TCRs are: (i) Ordered TCRs, (ii) Graded TCRs, (iii) Layered TCRs, (iv) Nested TCRs, (v) Combinatorial TCRs, or (vi) Continuous Token-Curated Registries. They mitigate some of the attack vectors described above, or to add quality of information to the listing. Their token governance rules vary. ~ (Location 6430)

How to Design a Token System If you would like to tokenize your business or community and make it Web3 ready, how do you need to approach your token design? Which questions do you have to ask yourself? What know-how do you need in your team to be able to properly “design” or “engineer” these tokens? The aim of this chapter is to understand what questions are relevant in the design and engineering process of a new token system, depending on what type of token you want to create. (Location 6514)

The motivation behind using the word engineering (instead of design) is to do justice to the infrastructural and mission-critical nature of Web3 networks and many of their potential applications. Trent McConaghy states that, “Engineering is about rigorous analysis, design, and verification of systems; all assisted by tools that reconcile theory with practice. Engineering is also a discipline of responsibility: being ethically and professionally accountable to the machines that you build, as illustrated by the Tacoma Narrows Bridge viewings and iron rings.” He was probably the first person to coin the term “token engineering,” hoping that “token ecosystem design would also become a field of rigorous analysis, design, and verification. It would have tools that reconcile theory with practice. (Location 6526)

“Infrastructure tokens” are tokens that either steer public blockchain networks (1st layer) or second-layer protocols such as state channels, or other Web3 protocols such as distributed file storage networks (more: Part 1 - Web3, the Stateful Web). These infrastructure tokens are purpose driven, incentivizing collective maintenance of said networks. The most important design questions in the engineering process are related to questions of security, scalability, and privacy. (Location 6561)

Scalability aspects address the trade off between security, decentralization, and scalability. Maintaining security and a high level of decentralization while enabling scalability is an engineering question with a variety of trade-offs. Different scalability techniques, such as sharding, interoperability, state channels, and alternative cryptographic tools that reduce bolting of transactions, are currently being tested to address these issues (more: Annex - Scalability).

Privacy aspects address the questions of what type of cryptography should be used to allow for the right “privacy by design.” In early blockchain networks, the data that is included in a token and its exchanges is public to anyone. Via additional cryptographic mechanisms, access grants can be managed in a more privacy-preserving manner (more: Part 3 - Privacy Tokens). However, that does not come for free, as every additional encryption is a cost to add up on the contract invocation. (Location 6570)

“Application tokens” are managed by an underlying distributed ledger and other Web3 networks. The technical engineering process will need to consider which infrastructure and token standards to use. It furthermore needs to consider potential interoperability needs of the token system. Infrastructure used: Since application tokens are managed by a distributed ledger, all privacy, scalability, decentralization, and security needs of the token will have to be met by the underlying infrastructure. Infrastructural constraints, therefore, need to be considered when choosing between the trade-offs of one solution and another. Interoperability: In spite of the fact that distributed ledgers currently have limited interoperability, there are solutions on the horizon that might favor one system over the other. Depending on how much interoperability your token system requires in the long run, infrastructure questions need to be considered. Standards: The technical engineering process can choose from a growing list of standardized token contracts. The token standards used depend on the properties a token should have (privacy, fungibility, transferability, expiry date), and the properties depend on the purpose of the token, taking into account all economic, legal, or ethical constraints.

Legal Engineering Legal Engineering of tokens is the predominant task when we deal with “simple token systems.” The term “simple” is commonly used in the complex systems88 domain. In the context of token engineering, the term “simple” refers to the fact that the dynamics of the business or governance models of a potential token are well known, as in the case of (i) central bank money, (ii) securities and other assets, (iii) identification and certification processes, (iv) voting rights, (v) vouchers and coupons, or (vi) entry tickets and other access rights.

The respective business or governance processes of these use cases have been stress tested over decades, sometimes centuries. Potential loopholes have been closed over the years in a process of trial and error, and there is regulation in place. Tokenization of such business/governance processes requires predominantly legal engineering, which refers to making the tokenization of existing assets, access rights, and voting rights legally compliant with local legislation. Legal engineering, therefore, refers to the tokenization of traditional governance models where smart contracts replace many of the existing human/paper/client-server–based operations. Relevant questions in the legal engineering process of identity tokens, currency tokens, asset tokens, or voting-rights tokens are: * Which transnational/national/local jurisdiction(s) need to be considered? * Which regulatory bodies might be concerned? * How do we design smart contracts so that they are legally compliant? * Does the jurisdiction need to be changed to cater to the new possibilities/dynamics of tokenization and the Web3?

Sociotechnical systems was first coined in the 1940s and refers to the interaction of social and technical aspects of private and public organizations and communities, online and in the real world. It refers to the studies of the complex infrastructures a society uses, such as the Internet and other communication networks, supply chains, and legal systems, and human behavior. The relation can be either simple (linear cause-and-effect relationships) or complex (non-linear and hard to steer and predict). (Location 6615)

The main questions that need to be answered in such design processes are Goal of your token system: What kind of system do you want to create? How many different token types do you need? Some token systems have multiple token types to steer collective action within the network. Examples that were explained in previous chapters of this book are the decentralized social media network Steemit (STEEM, SP, SBD) or the stable token MakerDAO (DAI, WETH, PETH, SIN, MKR). Other token systems only have one token, like the Bitcoin network. It can be generally assumed that the more token types, the more complex the network dynamics of steering that network. Purpose: The definition of a clear purpose of the token is necessary for the further design process. Having analyzed over 100 token systems, it seems that clearer the purpose, the more resilient the network. My personal opinion is that a token should only have one purpose. If you have multiple purposes, you probably need more token types. Otherwise, the mechanism design of your token system can become too complex. Properties: Once the purpose is defined, one can derive the properties of the token, taking into account all economic, legal, or ethical constraints that could influence the dynamics of a token system.

Examples for property choice and potential dynamics are: (i) Transferability: Are the tokens tied to a unique identity (person or institution) or do they have limited transferability? Depending on the use case, the answer would be different. Limited transferability automatically reduces the liquidity of a token, making it infeasible as a medium of exchange. Reputation tokens, for example, need to be tied to the identity of a person or organization in the network and should have no transferability at all. Transferable reputation tokens could be traded on the free market, making them non-indicative for personal behavior in the network, as in the case of “Steem Power” tokens in the Steemit ecosystem. (ii) Fungibility: If tokens are identical and not tied to an identity, the monetary policy of a token system, including the inflation rate, needs to be determined because the tokens can act as a medium of exchange (payment token). (iii) Expiry Date: If a token has an expiry date, this will reduce inflation of the token. An expiry date might also be desirable in the case of coupons or entry tickets and other access rights.

Depending on the use case, the answer would be different. Limited transferability automatically reduces the liquidity of a token, making it infeasible as a medium of exchange. Reputation tokens, for example, need to be tied to the identity of a person or organization in the network and should have no transferability at all. Transferable reputation tokens could be traded on the free market, making them non-indicative for personal behavior in the network, as in the case of “Steem Power” tokens in the Steemit ecosystem. (ii) Fungibility: If tokens are identical and not tied to an identity, the monetary policy of a token system, including the inflation rate, needs to be determined because the tokens can act as a medium of exchange (payment token). (iii) Expiry Date: If a token has an expiry date, this will reduce inflation of the token. An expiry date might also be desirable in the case of coupons or entry tickets and other access rights.

Proof-of…: The properties of a token are the basis for modeling a fault-tolerant mechanism to steer the network toward a collective goal. The aim of such a fault-tolerant mechanism is to define upon which behavior the tokens are minted, so it is resilient against corruption, attacks, or mistakes. Proof-of-Work has proven to be resilient to achieve the purpose (P2P transactions). The reputation token of the Steemit network (Steem Power), on the other hand, doesn’t have a resilient token design to fit its purpose (to serve as a fault-tolerant reputation token that is indicative of quality content).

Ethical Engineering The design of token systems also requires ethical and political thinking. What type of system we want to create is not a technological question but a socio-economic and political question. (Location 6641)

Questions of politics, morals, and ethics will need to be answered, ideally before the design of such systems. If we fail to incorporate ethical questions in the design thinking process of such systems, we will create “protocol bias.” History has shown that, eventually, all these questions will need to be resolved.

Transparency vs. Privacy: The trade-off between public and private interests is an age-old political discussion that has been studied by political science and sociology. While the privacy of the individual is important, it might undermine the public interest. Let’s take the case of supply chain transparency: while most consumers probably agree that more information about what happens along the supply chain of goods and services is what they would wish for, the act of providing such a level of transparency could infringe individual rights (i.e. a camera in a factory to monitor workers’ rights also violates the privacy of the workers, depending on how that data is revealed). It is therefore crucial that we hire social scientists with the right know-how when answering such questions. (Location 6650)

Power Structures: Trade-off between decentralization, security, and scalability is a much discussed topic in blockchain networks. The trilemma of decentralization raises the political question of how much decentralization is needed/wanted depending on the use case and the values of a community. The more decentralized, the slower the network is, and vice versa. Otherwise, one has to sacrifice security of the network. Power structures are also important when designing reputation tokens on a social media network like Steemit.com. In (Location 6656)

The quick and dirty approach of the Web1 and Web2, where the development process was rather “hack now and pivot later” oriented, does not play out well in the Web3. Once the bias is in the protocol, it is hard to revert the changes without consensus of all network actors. We, therefore, need to move away from Silicon Valley “meme-based development” to an “engineering-based development” that includes all aspects of the engineering process. “Simple token systems” will probably require predominantly legal and technological engineering, while “complex token systems” will need a good balance of all four areas.

Chapter Summary ~ The terms “design” and “engineering” are closely related but not the same. Rather, they complement each other. While the term “design” might be a more known and intuitive term, carrying a more subjective, creative, and even artistic meaning, the term “engineering” tends to bring to the forefront the technical aspects, the composition of inert parts to create a predictable and robust whole. ~ Design is a part of an engineering process. The term “engineering design” is used to describe the part of the engineering process which is open ended and ultimately more subjective. Similar to electrical engineering and public policy design, token engineering is about rigorous analysis, design, and verification of systems and their assumptions. Their assumptions need to be assisted by tools that reconcile theory with practice. As opposed to electrical engineering, designing human behavior is much more similar to steering national economies, and public policy design, as it requires much more “fuzzy” modeling techniques. ~ With the emergence of AI and better simulation tools, we might be able to design and deploy more effective purpose-driven tokens that also factor in unknown probability distributions, unknown or adversarial behaviors of agents, potential network externalities, and “tragedy of the commons” incurred to other parts of society. ~ Engineering is the practice of creating a technology that ultimately always has a social goal. Looking at engineering though a purely technological lens perpetuates a reductionist mindset on why and how we build technology. There seems to be a growing understanding for the need of using the term “engineering” in the broader sense when designing a token system. ~ The Web3 with its distributed ledgers and smart contracts provides a governance layer and an economic layer for the Internet. If something goes wrong, the collateral damage is high. ~ Technical engineering relates to the technical questions of creating an infrastructure token or an application token, and how to technically implement the token system: Infrastructure tokens or application tokens? Security aspects address the design of the cryptoeconomic mechanisms to provide the level of security needed. Scalability aspects address the trade off between security, decentralization, and scalability. Privacy aspects address the questions of what type of cryptography should be used to allow for the right “privacy by design.” ~ Legal Engineering of tokens is the predominant task when we deal with “simple token systems.” The term “simple” is commonly used in the complex systems domain. In the context of token engineering, the term “simple” refers to the fact that the dynamics of the business or governance models of a potential token are well known, as in the case of (i) central bank money, (ii) securities and other assets, (iii) identification and certification processes, (iv) voting rights, (v) vouchers and coupons, or (vi) entry tickets and other access rights. Tokenizing known business/governance processes requires making the tokenization of existing assets, access rights, and voting rights legally compliant with local legislation. ~ Economic engineering is predominantly required when designing “complex token systems.” The incentives and governance rules of the community are tied to “purpose-driven tokens” that steer collective action of the community through automated mechanisms. The tools that are necessary to design such systems can be found in economics, network science, cyber-physical systems, and sociotechnical systems. The main questions that need to be answered in such design processes deal with the following questions: What kind of system do you want to create? How many different token types do you need? Purpose? Properties: Transferability, fungibility, expiry date? ~ The design of token systems also requires ethical and political thinking. What type of system we want to create is not a technological question but a socio-economic and political question. Questions of politics, morals, and ethics will need to be answered, ideally before the design of such systems, the most important of which revolve around the questions of “transparency vs. privacy” and “power structures.” If we fail to incorporate ethical questions in the design thinking process of such systems, we will create “protocol bias.” ~ Having lawyers, economists, and social scientists as part of the team in addition to the technical engineers, on executive level and below, will be paramount to developing resilient token systems. However, interdisciplinary work takes time and effort, as all four categories overlap and communication between the disciplines requires some ramp-up efforts. ~ (Location 6670)

Scalability Solutions One of the greatest challenges of a distributed consensus like Proof-of-Work is that, while it makes the network safe, it does not scale well. This is due to the trade-off between decentralization, security, and scalability. (Location 6910)

The “scalability trilemma” describes the trade-off in distributed consensus between decentralization, security, and scalability. (Location 6914)
Tags: #apply/mindset #concept/scalability-trilemma #domain/technology #insight/definition
  
Most popular solutions for achieving higher levels of throughput are alternative consensus protocols such as delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS), practical Byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT), or permissioned networks. Sharding of the ledger or alternative cryptographic algorithms are other means to address the scalability problem on the protocol level and will be described in this chapter. As an alternative, various efforts have been made to move scalability solutions to a second layer, such as “side chains” or “state channels.” In both cases, user interactions are shifted from the blockchain layer onto a second layer, while guaranteeing risk-free P2P transactions between participants. State Channels State channels offer a second layer on top of a blockchain network, allowing transactions that could occur on-chain to get settled off-chain, while maintaining the security of all network participants. In this process, transaction settlements are outsourced to a private state channel, which could be described as a two-way pathway between two users. These state channels are formalized and processed by a smart contract. “State channels” allow for the transfer of any state for any type of decentralized application. “Payment channels” only allow for the transfer of payments. They are useful if two parties, Alice and Bob, have an ongoing business relationship with continuous back-and-forth payments. Tokens are temporarily locked as a security mechanism in case of disputes: (i) Tokens can be sent from Alice to Bob and vice versa using state channels where they are locked up via a multi-signature scheme or a smart contract for a pre-defined period of time. (ii) Both Alice and Bob sign each transaction with their private key, but the transactions are kept private and are not broadcasted to the blockchain network. (iii) After the period has passed, the balance of all bilateral transactions is broadcasted to the blockchain network, which closes the state channel. Let’s assume that Alice has 200 ETH and Bob has 100 ETH. Within a certain period of time, Alice sends ten payments of 10 ETH and Bob sends Alice two payments of 25 ETH. If all transactions would be settled on the Ethereum network directly, twelve individual transactions would be registered by all nodes in the network. Not only would this bloat the number of transactions and slow the network, it would also be more expensive for both Alice and Bob, since each single transaction would incur a transaction fee.

One of the biggest challenges of the Bitcoin network and similar networks is the management of unspent transactions. These unspent transactions contribute to the exponential growth of the ledger. In Bitcoin, for example, they are referred to as UTXOs, and contribute to a higher payload, more expensive transactions, and less throughput per second. (Location 7020)

Alternative cryptographic algorithms used in collective signatures, like multi-signatures90, ring signatures, threshold signatures,91 or Schnorr signatures,92 could resolve certain scalability problems, for example, by reducing information added to the ledger, or eliminating that information with multi-signatures, and redeem scripts. With multi-signature transactions, for example, receiver addresses are aggregated into one multisig receiver address and cause the accompanying redeem script to be stored offline. It also reduces the number of outputs and script size inside the transaction. The same is true for ring signatures, threshold signatures, and collective signatures. (Location 7028)

Just as the WWW made it easy to publish a webpage with a few lines of code, the Web3 made it just as easy to issue your own token in a few lines of code. However, it took us over a decade to figure out what we can really do with websites, and when we did, the Web2 took off. The crypto community, together with researchers, still needs to develop methods suitable for the formalization of classification, design, architecture, parameters, and behavior of agents in a tokenized network.
