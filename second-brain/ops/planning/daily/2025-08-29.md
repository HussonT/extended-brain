# Friday, August 29, 2025

**Weekly Context:** [[Week 35, 2025]]

## üéØ Morning Intention
**ONE THING:** Get a CLI demo to work

**Character Focus:** Formidability & Relentlessness - Speed and learning velocity over perfection

## ‚ö° Today's Focus Tasks

### Must Do:
- [ ] **Morning Setup (Before 2pm)** - Get environment completely ready for iterations
  - [ ] Environment configured
  - [ ] All dependencies installed  
  - [ ] Test harness ready
  - [ ] Documentation template open
- [ ] **Afternoon Sprint (2pm-6pm)** - 20+ rapid iteration attempts
  - [ ] Ship fast iterations - get something working, test, improve, repeat
  - [ ] Document learnings from each loop - what worked, what didn't, next attempt
- [ ] **Push through multiple versions** - Volume of attempts creates insight

### Would Be Nice:
- [ ] Share progress update with team if significant breakthrough

## üìÖ Time Blocks

| Time | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Morning (Now-2pm) | Setup & Preparation - Get everything ready for velocity |
| 2:00pm - 6:00pm | **DEEP WORK: CLI Demo Iterations** - No interruptions, pure execution |
| After 6pm | Personal time |

**Remember:** "Be so good they can't ignore you. Be so strategic they can't afford to lose you."

**Today's Approach:** Relentless iteration velocity. This is PROVING WEEK - show them what formidable looks like.
