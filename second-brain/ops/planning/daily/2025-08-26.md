## 🎯 Today's Tasks
- [x] Hackathon with Watertight team - GPT-OSS red teaming exercise
- [x] Started CLI demo (partial - hackathon took priority)

## 📝 Notes
- GPT-OSS 20B Red Teaming competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/openai-gpt-oss-20b-red-teaming)
- Hackathon with Watertight team - great energy and learning
- Working on AI safety through adversarial testing
- **Shipped something half-decent in under 7 hours!**

## 🔥 Top 3 Learnings Today
1. **Speed of iteration is king** - think by doing more than thinking by thinking
2. **Persona vectors are high leverage** to understand well
3. **This shit is FUN** - genuine excitement about the work

## 📋 Promises & Commitments
### To Others:
- **CLI demo** - Promised completion today → moved to tomorrow (partial delivery)
- **Akio** - Promised to do something this week → uncertain if will happen

### To Self:
- CLI demo completion (rescheduled)

## 🌙 Evening Reflection

### What went well:
- Showed up on time and put in work to be the best/most useful person in the company
- Made strategic decision to prioritize hackathon over CLI demo
- Shipped working solution in 7 hours with the team

### Challenges:
- Spent too much time on scaffolding and low-value setup work
- Need to get better at determining what's worth doing first
- **Key insight:** "If hard work is all it took, the donkey would own the farm"
