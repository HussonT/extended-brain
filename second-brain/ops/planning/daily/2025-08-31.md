## üåÖ Morning Planning

## üåô Evening Reflection

### Integrity Check
- No people-pleasing lies
- One comfort-over-truth moment: texting Jaidyn from boredom/tiredness rather than genuine interest

### What went well today?
- Team responded really well to the hurt-help demo concept
- Amazing bonding time with Aengus yesterday (still feeling the positive effects)
- LOVED the sunset bike ride around Golden Gate Bridge
- Completed first Google CLI demo variant with deep strategic thinking

### What was challenging?
- Didn't get to the vision doc at all
- Could have worked faster (mentioned not working at exceptional speed)
- Poor sleep affecting energy/focus

### Lessons learned
- Key insight: There's a gap between misalignment being harmful vs potentially harmful
- Deep understanding of realistic attack vectors and their real-world constraints
- Security scenarios need to account for actual vs theoretical risks

### Tomorrow's Priority
- Get really good realistic CLI demos working
- Provide strategic insight in the planning
- Continue proving essential value to Watertight team

### Daily Score: 6/10
- What held it back: Super distracted, could have worked much faster
- Missing: Vision doc completion would have made it higher
