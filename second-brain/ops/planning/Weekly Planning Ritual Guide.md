- Use the **Weekly Review** template from `Templates/Weekly Review.md`
- Place it in the `ops/planning/weekly/` folder
- Name it: `Week XX, YYYY.md` (e.g., "Week 05, 2025")

### 2. Set Your Priorities (10 minutes)
- Identify your **Top 3 Priorities** - what MUST happen this week
- Break down goals by life area:
  - Professional
  - Personal Development
  - Health & Wellness
  - Relationships

### 3. Define Success Metrics (5 minutes)
- Write 2-3 concrete indicators of a successful week
- Make them measurable and specific

### 4. Anticipate Blockers (5 minutes)
- What might prevent progress?
- How can you prepare for these challenges?

## 📝 Daily Practice (5-10 minutes each day)

### Morning (2-3 minutes)
1. Create daily note using the **Daily Progress** template in `ops/planning/daily/`
2. Set your ONE thing that would make today a win
3. Pull 3 tasks from your weekly goals
4. Optional: Plan time blocks for focused work

### Evening (3-5 minutes)
1. Check off completed tasks
2. Quick reflection:

3. Rate your day (1-10) based on progress toward weekly goals

## 🔄 Weekly Review Process (End of Week)

### Friday Evening or Weekend (15-20 minutes)
1. Open your current week's review note
2. Complete the "Notes & Reflections" section:
   - What worked well this week?

5. Create next week's review note
