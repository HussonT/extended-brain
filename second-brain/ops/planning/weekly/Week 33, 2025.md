3. **3 videos edited and published online**

## üöß Potential Blockers

- Video editing taking longer than expected if rusty
- Balancing current Telepathic work while mentally pivoting to job search
- Energy management - maintaining 6pm boundary

## üîç Character & Learning Focus

### Character Trait of the Month
**Discipline to underpromise and overdeliver** - Setting internal deadlines tighter than external ones, keeping promises to myself

### Active Learning Goals
- Big tech interview preparation strategies
- Understanding FDE/Sales Engineer role requirements
- What makes companies like Anthropic successful

### Mentor Connections
- Wim at Anthropic (reach out by Friday)
- Create shortlist of 3-5 additional mentors to approach

## üí° Strategic Insights

### Energy Adjustment for the Week
**Focus on underpromising and overdelivering** - Work with both outward and inward deadlines, trusting that consistent execution will build momentum and credibility.

### 20/80 Focus
**Get at least 1 application out the door** - This forces resume completion and portfolio v1, creating momentum for the bigger pivot.

### What Would the Formidable Version of Me Do?
Execute all three priorities without excuses, maintaining the 6pm boundary to ensure personal development doesn't get sacrificed for immediate work demands.

## üé® Creation & Contribution
- **PLG onboarding calls** - Helping users succeed with Telepathic
- **3 videos** - Sharing knowledge and insights with audience
- **andwho demo** - Showcasing concrete value creation in portfolio

## üìù Notes & Reflections
*Key insight from last week:* "Don't be stupid" - Create momentum with simple working versions rather than trying to build the perfect vision immediately. This aligns with underpromise/overdeliver philosophy.

*This week's theme:* Building momentum through disciplined execution while strategically positioning for the next chapter.
