This co-founder agreement signifies not just a business arrangement, but an important commitment between us as partners. We, the undersigned, pledge to each other our unwavering dedication and commitment to build, nurture, and grow the business that we are about to embark upon. We understand that this journey will not always be smooth sailing, but we trust in each other's abilities and shared vision, ready to face whatever challenges that may come our way. We commit to uphold the principles etched out in the following document ensuring our partnership remains strong and our business thrives.

## Article 1 | Growth & contribution.

We choose to be (business) partners because we share these two values without a shadow of a doubt. These values are the strongest foundation we have as a team & partnership to keep growing in parallel & mutually beneficial directions. We express our commitment to these values in the following, non-exhaustive ways:

- We spot & communicate each-others blindspots.
- We ACTIVELY encourage & stimulate each other to grow.
- Contribution is a measured metric that we report to each other - both personal & in the business.

## Article 2 | An aligned work ethic.

Friends that ship together, stay together. We’ve come to understand that the small stuff matters just as much as the big stuff. Together has many meanings - it means physically together but also on the same wavelength. Our belief tends to be organised around a hybrid of radically in person & distributed by default. An aligned work ethic for us means operating on that same wavelength & creating space for synergies to occur. We uphold our commitment to an aligned work ethic in the following, non-exhaustive ways:

- We are punctual - we understand that we like to organise our days as we see fit but that requires an ability to count on each other & not disregard each other’s time & commitment to that time.
- We commit to non-heavy, lighthearted time together.
- Olympic mentality: diligent work, diligent rest.
- Rhytmed outcome reviews. (no bigger gaps than bi-weekly)
- Rhytmed personal battery checks.
- Compulsory rest moments - (1 day/week cumulative + quarterly min 4 days of retreat/rest)

## Article 3 | Effective communication.

If we don’t work to understand each other, we will tear the business apart. We are literally the nucleus of the organism - and if this organism starts splitting its cells in different ways, that is literally cancer. We commit to a default harmonious, in sync way of operating to avoid death from cancer. In sync communication is like creating highways upon which our dreams can excel. It’s like rainbow road in Mario Kart and you don’t fall off and you’re able to hit all the boosters. We uphold our commitment to effective communication in the following, non-exhaustive ways:

- We schedule time weekly to reflect & refine on this common commitment through for example “hurt the business, help the business” meetings.
- We are kind, not nice with each-other. (radical candour - direct feedback but knowing that the other cares)
- We commit to certain communication protocols - for example linear reviews, attend 3/5 daily stand-ups, walks in the park, every Sunday we plan our key meetings like business meetings & sprint-planning meetings.
- We err on the side of over-communication - for example: slack channel with automated linear “dones”, …
- Optimistic interpretations: whenever we experience an action by the other as negative, we have to find 3 positive interpretations before we talk to the other person about to avoid destructive, defensive conversations.

  

## Article 4 | Clear responsibilities & accountability.

The most powerful person is an empowered person. Clear responsibilities & accountability set each of us up for maximum success in terms of leveraging our strengths & covering a common weaknesses. As a founding team we have literally set out to make the impossible, possible. That requires us to, together, be more than the sum of our parts. That starts with clarity. We uphold our commitment to clear responsibilities & accountability in the following, non-exhaustive ways:

- Miltos is responsible for a product that works.
- Tom is responsible for getting the product in people’s hands & feeding back the insights that come from this through linear items.
- We both commit to making our business a success.
- We come up with clear accountability mechanisms, whether through metrics or other.
- We support each other to the max to each be able to uphold our responsibilities.

## Article 5 | Financial alignment.

The lifeblood of any successful business is money. As the head and heart of this business, creating clots in our blood flow will lead to sure demise. How we treat & think about our lifeblood sets important cultural precedents for the team that joins. From the get go - we’ve believed that money can be used as a crutch to wash over business fundamentals such as attracting the right talent, sustaining experiments that shouldn’t work, etc. Our philosophy around finances at this stage of Eden is that cash is for survival, equity is for upside. We uphold our commitment to financial alignment in the following, non-exhaustive ways:

- Clear & upfront communication + agreements about personal finances that have to do with Eden.
- Monthly check-ins & financial reviews together.
