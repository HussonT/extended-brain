## The situation or context

Miltos wants $45K today & $45K upon raise with 2% equity. We currently have $170K in the bank. Our current burn is about $10K/month. We’ve been negotiating for a little while & are currently on speaking terms.

He’s okay with 2 scenarios:

1. Best case (for him in his words): he gets enough to live in New York for a year so he has time to find a co-founder & live with his girlfriend in NY
2. Worst case (for him in his words): company dissolves, he moves to the UK, gets a job & believes he can be back in the US in a year. He says he will sue whatever company I start next.

## The problem statement or frame

I need to figure out if I truly have a shot at making this work in the current constellation if I pay him $45k now & $45k upon raise.

The questions become:

1. Is Eden the only company I can see myself build? → if not, then we should just dissolve the company.
2. If Eden is the only company I can see myself build, am I willing to risk getting sued whenever I’m starting the next company? → if yes, dissolve the company
3. If I am not willing to risk getting sued, what level of resources do I need to make Eden a success in the next year? Anything below that level is just a slow form of suicide → dissolve the company

## The variables that govern the situation

1. **Miltos’ Demands:** The higher his demands, the higher the strain on the company, the less likely success for Eden becomes viable.
2. **Time:** Every week truly counts. We have the beginnings of traction that we can convert - so every hour that I’m not working on onboarding new communities is costing Eden.
3. **Manpower required**: To convert the traction we’re currently having with communities, we’re going to need to be able to build (& pay people willing to build with us long enough to get to the traction we need)
4. **Traction level needed:** What’s the traction level that we realistically need to buy ourselves either the time to where we need to get or that will make it possible for us to raise our seed round.
5. **My flexibility in building something else:** If I’m ok with building something else, that makes returning capital the move.
6. **Willingness to get sued later down the line:** If I think the risk of getting sued down the line is minimal, that makes returning capital the move.

## The complications or complexity as you see it

Most of the complexity comes from the fact that I don’t want to build another company as I’ve learned too much, built too many relationships & have build up too much inner conviction to let this stop me now as well as I do think Miltos should get something for the work he did, but I also want a fair shot at building Eden into the next version of what I know it can be.

That being said, he didn’t bring much value to Eden - in absolute terms you could argue the opposite. The reason we are not where we should be today is mostly because of him, but even beyond that because we weren’t a well fitting team & I wasn’t clear about what I needed/wanted - which isn’t entirely his fault. So there’s a lot of nuance to the situation.

What’s complex to figure out as well is how likely we are to get the traction we need. If we would have all the traction we needed at this point, it would’ve been an easy decision to pay blue - to be honest, we probably wouldn’t even be in this situation in the first place. It really seems like the lack of traction is at the root cause of all of our issues rn.

That’s I think where truly most of the complexity sits - what resources do we need to get the traction we need to get to the next stage & how can we all align in that same goal.

## Alternatives that were seriously considered and why they were not chosen

**Building a completely different company:** Kilian is building telepathic, which is an instant tutorial maker for SaaS products. I like the idea and it’s definitely a problem that I’ve experienced. The only real challenge that I have with it is that it’s a consensus, right business with mostly a technical risk. Either the product works & then it will be super easy to sell or the product doesn’t work and it will be a nightmare to sell. I’d have to understand more deeply what the true depth of the technical spike is.

  

**Risking getting sued:** Besides that I don’t think it’s the right thing to do, given that Miltos did try very hard to make this a success & acted more out of obliviousness rather than bad faith.

  

**Not do anything, preserve resources until we find the traction we need:** If we die, then we will have given it our all. But if we win, that will end up putting Miltos in a much higher leverage position at that time & will end up being a lot more expensive for the company.

  

**Bring Miltos back:** Trust is way beyond broken, plus the team just wasn’t working - it’s so clear that it wasn’t I was just bamboozled in the beginning.

  

**Let Miltos buy me out:** He does not have the confidence of our investors, they would want to see returned capital.

## A paragraph explaining the range of outcomes

There’s three outcomes possible - from our POV:

**Worst Case:** We dissolve the company - I start a new company, Miltos sues and we’re in a lose, lose situation. I can’t raise money for the next startup, or will always have to keep that in the back of my head as I build startups in the future.

**Mid Case 1:** We pay him where it puts us at the brink of making the traction we need possible - we run like crazy to make the 3 traction points that we need to make happen (5K interviewed → 10K MRR → Seed Raise)

**Mid Case 2:** We dissolve the company - I start a new company, Miltos doesn’t sue. V bad for him tho.

**Best Case:** We pay him a little bit now (Between $10K-$30K) & a bit more on success (between ($40 & $60K) - our incentives to make the business work are aligned. We maximise the resources we have to make it a success.

## A paragraph explaining what you expect to happen and the reasoning and actual probabilities you assign to each projected outcome (The degree of confidence matters, a lot.)

**10% = P(Worst case)** There are so many variables that need to align, first he needs to not be bluffing that he doesn’t want/need the money, second he needs to be making enough money in order to sue, third - when he’s making that kind of money, he needs to want to put it into a law suit that he know he can’t win, he needs to be willing to give up his path to O1

**20% = P(Mid Case 1)** The problem with this case is that it puts us in close to an impossible position - makes it harder to find a co-founder, makes it harder to get to the next stage and the only real winner here is Miltos, which makes this one really hard for us to accept. I do not want to be in a position of slow-suicide.

**20% = P(Mid Case 2)** I think there’s a good chance that he won’t sue because it’s a lose, lose situation. He know he can’t win so the only thing he would achieve is a lot of money down the drain & simply preventing me from building my next thing in this particular space.

**40% = P(Best Case)** He mostly wants money to be able to do his thing over the next couple of months/year. We’ll have a lot more info on where we are in terms of traction in 6 months and if we’ll be able to raise a bridge round etc.

## The time of day you’re making the decision and how you feel physically and mentally (If you’re tired, for example, write it down.)

Wrote all this over the course of the evening & the morning of april 1st & 2nd 2024. Not tired, pretty clear & without too much stress.
