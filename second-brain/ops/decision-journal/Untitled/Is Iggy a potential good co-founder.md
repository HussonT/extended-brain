## The situation or context

Iggy is building [Squadtalent.xyz](http://Squadtalent.xyz) & he’s doing a really good job building relationships with top talent & hiring managers who need help getting work done. His co-founder stepped down a little while back and so did mine.

We’re now trying to figure out if there’s a constellation in which it makes sense for us to merge our companies and if that would make us a better team to execute on the vision that we have.

## The problem statement or frame

How do we know if we’d be a good co-founder duo?

## The variables that govern the situation

**Complementarity:**

**Overall strategy for next steps:**

**Compatibility:**

**Abilities:**

**Possibility:**

## The complications or complexity as you see it

I think most of the complexity sits in our lack of complementarity.

Who will be shipping product when we build together? → I guess we can work with our freelancers but that means we need to pay them → agency problem.

If we team up, it’s clear we’re going to need to raise & spin the story that this is mostly a BD heavy company.

## Alternatives that were seriously considered and why they were not chosen (think: the work required to have an opinion)

## A paragraph explaining the range of outcomes

## A paragraph explaining what you expect to happen and the reasoning and actual probabilities you assign to each projected outcome (The degree of confidence matters, a lot.)

## The time of day you’re making the decision and how you feel physically and mentally (If you’re tired, for example, write it down.)

  

You have to make this part your own. I’ve seen others include:

1. What’s the primary thesis
2. What is the expected outcome(s)
3. What are the second and third-order consequences
4. What is the worst-case scenario and why that’s ok
5. What is the potential upside beyond the core thesis
6. What emotions am I experiencing
7. What is the opportunity cost (by doing this what am I not doing)
8. What unique advantages or insights do I have in this situation
9. Who is the best person to make this decision
10. What does this look like in 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years?
