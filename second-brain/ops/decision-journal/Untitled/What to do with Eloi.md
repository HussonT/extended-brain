## The situation or context

Eloi is an engineer that joined not because he’s an extraordinary engineer but mostly because Miltos needed help building the things he couldn’t build himself. I feel like he’s from a previous era and I probably wouldn’t hire him today - but there’s also

## The problem statement or frame

## The variables that govern the situation

## The complications or complexity as you see it

## Alternatives that were seriously considered and why they were not chosen (think: the work required to have an opinion)

## A paragraph explaining the range of outcomes

## A paragraph explaining what you expect to happen and the reasoning and actual probabilities you assign to each projected outcome (The degree of confidence matters, a lot.)

## The time of day you’re making the decision and how you feel physically and mentally (If you’re tired, for example, write it down.)

  

You have to make this part your own. I’ve seen others include:

1. What’s the primary thesis
2. What is the expected outcome(s)
3. What are the second and third-order consequences
4. What is the worst-case scenario and why that’s ok
5. What is the potential upside beyond the core thesis
6. What emotions am I experiencing
7. What is the opportunity cost (by doing this what am I not doing)
8. What unique advantages or insights do I have in this situation
9. Who is the best person to make this decision
10. What does this look like in 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years?
