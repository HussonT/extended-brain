# Conversations with startup founders

## Semi-technical (me)

- Cursor just makes it way to easy for me to test on my own data to be messing with the prompt
- Wordware is awesome for prompt development - but that’s often only useful once the initial use-case works

## Non-technical (arbitrage ai)

- Started simply prompt engineering in chatgpt
- I told them to use wordware: felt quickly limited by how they could present it to users (so not much better than an internal too)
- When they wanted to hook it up to their own UI, they discovered that cursor could do the job wordware was doing but at fraction of the cost + with a lot easier access to their own data-structuctures (this was after one of the non-tech guys took a develop w ai course).

## General feedback

## Technical friends

- Couldn’t see why they’d pay a 30% premium to reach
- Only use-case where this would make sense is where one person is absolutely non-technical
