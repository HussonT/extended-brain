a16z crypto um I have raised Capital so I actually um do not only sit on the kind of investor side of the table but have also been the one kind of in the trenches pitching so um I have a lot of empathy for how challenging it can be um and hopefully also a few kind of words of advice and wisdom that will be helpful so let's get started so what we're going to cover today is basically how you begin so before you even start putting together your deck what are you going to be thinking about pre pitch so before you start talking to investors what is sort of your plan of action the pitch itself and then post pitch so what do you do after you've hopefully successfully raised money so before you begin your deck what you're going to want to do is answer two really important question questions um I think a lot of people think about pitching as sort of just transferring information but it's really about answering questions that live in the Investor's mind whether or not they ask them to explicitly so I think the first one is really why is this a big market so um when you're thinking about positioning your company you don't only want to talk about why this is a problem or why what you're building is cool but rather also tell the story of sort of the big vision and the big opportunity um and then the secondary part of of that question is why are you specifically the best positioned to tackle that problem um I think one thing we think a lot about as investors is How Deeply have the founders explored the idea Maze and how good is the founder market fit so why are you and your team exactly the right people to be building this particular thing so those are kind of the two questions that you should try to be answering in the story arc of your uh of your deck which we'll get to in a second this is a question that I ask every founder almost in in a pitch because I think it really gives the founder the opportunity to sort of set the stage for what it is that your ultimate vision is going to be um and even if the investor doesn't ask it to you explicitly I think it's really helpful to kind of paint that picture for them so they can imagine like how big is this opportunity really assuming everything goes according to plan and nothing ever goes according to plan but you can still get to that place or somewhere similar over time so um I think that should be kind of part of the the intention of the conversation is helping them see what you see for your future okay so before you get started with the actual pitch it's really helpful to kind of have a plan of action and not be going around sort of pitching randomly so um I I would say one of the earliest steps you should take is build a list of the investors that you want to talk to and order them in terms of timing so it's often best to start with some of the the friendlier conversations that might be Angels it could be even other members of your cohort or advisers who can help give you feedback on your pitch so that you're not shooting your biggest shot with the investor that you most want on day one obviously your your uh answers to questions and sort of your narrative is going to get more and more refined over time so making sure that you can really um hone your answers to be as precise and concise uh as possible over time is is really helpful another important thing to make sure you have a good handle on before you start talking to investors is your competitive landscape obviously um you know if if an investor asks you oh well what about X company and you're like oh I've never heard of them that doesn't um you know reflect super positively and I think it can can make you look a little bit uninformed so making sure that you have a great understanding of um who else is in your market and specifically if the investors that you're speaking to have any existing relationships in that market um is is is important to do um and then you also want to go into these meetings understanding like who exactly you're talking to what size of check do they write are they focused on this category and so that way you know if you're talking to a16z crypto you don't have to explain what an NFD is but maybe if you're starting with a generalist fund um you may need to give a little bit more background context so just really understanding who you're talking to I think is important okay so getting in in front of the right investors obviously you're going to want to put your network to do um the best use I will say warm intros are obviously the the best way to go if you can get them um but it's also possible to write a great cold email and we can talk about that later in in the Q&A um but yes if you can get a warm intro obviously that's always going to be your your best bet as I mentioned you're going to want to go with the friendliest conversations first and then move on to some of the more challenging ones later um and then lastly I think obviously in a market like ours where there can be significant sort of Market fluctuations and there are definitely better times or Worse times to raise around um you you may want to take that into consideration but at the same time what you really want to focus on is having all your ducks in a row you can't necessarily control the market but you can control um you know how you're positioned to the fund raise and that means you know having a good handle on your financials or making sure that you're thinking about the the uh fund raise as it relates to kind of big product announcements and things like that so being a little bit strategic about the timing of those things can be helpful too I'll let you guys read the quote First Time Founders are obsessed with product second time Founders are obsessed with distribution I think um this is really really true and something that we see time and time again with with Founders um I think a lot of people end up starting companies because they're obsessed with a particular problem or a particular product um but the reality is if you don't have good distribution nobody's going to care so making sure that as you think about telling your story you have a really strong answer on uh go to market is you know I think a necessary step to uh figure out before you start talking with investors too much and I know you've gotten a lot of great content on that front already from Jason I know Maggie is's going to be speaking on this um but um yeah I think that's that's really just something that cannot be emphasized enough because at the end of the day um distri you know build it and they will come is like a big big scam in my opinion it doesn't actually work like that and so figuring out what it what are going to be the important distribution channels for you is uh you know a big part of crafting your story for investors as we said not just product go to market and distribution Partners obviously Partnerships are can be an important part of the go to market motion as well um and then in web 3 I think very specifically building and growing your community I think obviously that um varies depending on on what exactly you're building but for example for games the community is hugely important so really understanding what does your community want how are you going to engage with them um and having crisp answers to all of that before you start talking to investors now that you've magically figured out all of your go to market and distribution questions time to actually get ready for the pitch meeting so you're going to want to understand the market practice beforehand to make sure your answers are are really crisp and then also tailor the deck to the investors you're speaking with so again if you're talking to a generalist investor um versus a crypt native investor it may make sense to have a slightly different version verion of your deck that goes deeper into certain areas or not um you may also want to develop a teaser deck that sort of has you know 8 to 10 slides but doesn't give the full everything um because what you're really aiming to do when you're sending the deck out hopefully with a warm intro is to get a meeting so once you've done that then you can go into more more in- depth and you can certainly follow up with with more materials but I think in many cases um you're better off holding a little bit of information back and instead um just focusing on on getting in the room with the investor and then you can reveal when you're going into these meetings I think it's also helpful to try to understand what the investor can do for you um and have an answer ready to the question of how can investors help you aside from just giving you money um I think that does a couple of things number one it shows that you hopefully have done research and understand the capabilities of that investor for example if you're talking to someone who specializes in helping companies recruit then you say oh recruiting um and that also helps the investor start to Envision the relationship of working with you um and shows them that there are ways that they are equipped to help that match what sort of you're looking for okay the pitch we've arrived at the critical moment okay so a few Logistics um I know these seem very basic but I assure you I see hundreds of not thousands of pitches a year and you would be amazed at the condition in which some of those occur so I will just uh air on the side of being explicit um number one make sure that you have good lighting and that the investor can see you and that you do not look like you are in the witness protection program so like no hats no hoodies like let them see your face cuz they are at the end of the day mostly evaluating you guys especially at the early stages of of investing so make sure that they can see you um energy I think is super critical obviously if you are trying to convince someone to give you money you want them to be excited and so being enthusiastic about whatever it is you're working on um is another thing that again sounds very basic but you'd be surprised how often people seem that they're bored with their own idea which is makes it hard for you as an investor to get very excited um enunciate so make sure that you're speaking clearly and that people can understand what you're talking about um don't be late duh and then read the room so if if for example you're talking to an investor and at a certain point they seem like they're totally based out uh it might be a good time to ask them a question an
