So this one is a bit of an honour code as in we need to take full ownership on whether this is a preventable error or not!

Here’s a non-exhaustive list of preventable errors as I see it:

- Errors that we’ve solved before
- Errors in our “happy flows”
    - Login → buy → post a job
    - Click job post → finish application
- Errors that are flagged by our systems
- Errors that are due to sloppy processes on our side that with an hour of work or good conventions are preventable
