My guys,

I‚Äôm writing a lil memo because

1. It‚Äôs important we‚Äôre on the same page for the things I‚Äôm about to talk about.
2. There is scientific proof that when things are written down & read in this way retention & alignment go way up.

  

The next 6 months are important for us: we need to think about becoming a fundable company in 6 months - if we can‚Äôt achieve that, our lives are about to get really, really difficult. So - in this memo I want to outline what I think we need to achieve/do in-order to become that fundable company. This memo is mostly to invite your thoughts/ideas and make sure we‚Äôre all ready & excited to pull this off. I know we can do this, however it‚Äôs looking like Eden will require more of us than she ever has in the next couple of months - so let‚Äôs get ready. ü´°

## What does it mean to be an investable seed-company?

In short, this means that we need to start thinking about the story we want to sell to investors & the metrics we need to hit to power that story. Ideally it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got an ember, we just need your fuel to turn it into this raging fire‚Äù type story. Seed means we‚Äôve got a somewhat working (!) product with a proven or clear path to a proven business model. Part of our challenge over the next couple of months will be to bring this in a convincing story that is easy & exciting to understand.

Concretely for us that translates to: we have an AI-powered job-board that lets hiring managers effectively source otherwise hidden talent from online communities. Our AI takes care of the first interview, drastically reducing the information asymmetry between that exists between talent & hiring manager upfront. This is especially valuable in web3 because you often don‚Äôt know who or what you‚Äôre talking to which makes first interviews especially costly.

The way we‚Äôre going to expand the value of that ember is by enabling high-precision/relevant search through our interview-based search & a credibility mechanisms that scales relevantly through our multiplayer referrals.

In its limit - this leads to a better hiring game that gets more people on the right project for the right reasons and will allow companies to operate with an in-pluggable liquid workforce.

## What is our investable story?

From an investment point of view, they‚Äôll look at 3 important things in that order = team, market (potential) & product. The way we‚Äôll tell that story is in by having an exceptionally clear & convincing answer to the following 3 questions:

1. **What?**
    1. what do you have now?
2. **Why now?**
    1. what‚Äôs the path we see to this being huge?
    2. why does this matter now?
    3. why was this previous impossible?
3. **Why us?**
    1. how can you make us believe you‚Äôre the guys to do this?

### What?

> [!important] It‚Äôs super clear that this isn‚Äôt a crips, clear convincing story yet - but this is just to make sure we‚Äôre aligned on the complex story so we can find simplicity on the farside of complexity.

We‚Äôre building tools that change the hiring games we play at scale.

The driving belief behind our company is that a world where everyone gets to do work they love with people they like is a vastly better world.

The mission we chose to take on from that foundational belief is to build highly effective hiring tools which leads to more people being the right person on the right project for the right reasons - with employee engagement rates hovering around a mere 15%, it‚Äôs clear we‚Äôve got a long way to go.

The concrete first product we‚Äôve built in light of that mission is a tool that sits on-top of existing online communities & leverages AI + Blockchain to shine a light on the community talent & its credibility.

Pushing this will make the following future possible (less important but still cool to work through and this is work I‚Äôll do over the next couple of weeks)

- **The scalable referral narrative: context & credibility**
    
    If we had perfect information on context & credibility of all the talent in the world - we‚Äôd be able to make vastly cheaper hiring decisions with higher confidence. At its core, that translates the hiring problem into a combination of two main challenges. There‚Äôs an expensive information asymmetry component (context) & a tricky signal theory component (credibility).
    
    When looking through this lens at most of the (online) talent sources that exist today, it becomes obvious why the recruitment & staffing industry is a $650 billion industry. Hiring good recruiters are currently the most cost-effective way to reduce the information asymmetry & help with preliminary interpretation of credibility signals - but as you know, recruiters are incredibly expensive.

    Today, the most effective way we know how to solve the hiring problem is trough referrals. The problem with referrals is that they are not scalable. Context & credibility are, however. AI & Blockchain are respectively beautiful context & credibility scalars.
    
- **The broken recruitment-game narrative: match vs volume dominant strategies**
- **The decentralised LinkedIn narrative: the talent <> opportunity <> distribution trifecta**
- **The internet workforce narrative: People > opportunities, projects > roles**

### Why us?

We‚Äôve got experience in the space

We‚Äôre obsessed with the space

We‚Äôve got the skills to leverage the new technologies

We‚Äôve been active in the web3 world since 2017

### Why now?

Opportunity to operate from the next paradigm & bring the future into the present

The AI hype + crypto winter

Market timing: Tech layoffs

Broader labour market trends: gigification of work, remote work + easy global arbitrage thanks to companies like Deel, growing importance of online communities, growing targeted distribution power of ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù

## What are the metrics we need to hit to make that story come to life?

Even though some of the story is still a bit fuzzy on how exactly we‚Äôre going to present but the clear ‚Äúbasis vectors‚Äù we‚Äôve been building on since day 1 are very clear: increased context & credibility leads to better talent matches. This requires us to show strong signal for two key hypotheses:

1. High-bandwidth context matching: AI can be used to effectively reduce the information asymmetry a lot more cheaply between hiring manager & talent.
2. Scalable credibility signals: Blockchain can be used to build credible signal borrowing/talent prediction markets which lead to better hiring decisions.

These are the two axiomatic hypotheses that make all of our narratives credible.

I propose the following metrics:

H1:

1. **Total number of mapped talent**
2. **Total number of live interviews scheduled**

Optional:

1. Average interviews/active job seeker
2. Total number of jobs posted
3. Total number of A+ candidates

  

H2:

1. **% of users that get a live interview that have 2 or more key holders**

Optional

1. Average # key holders for users with an average matchstimate of B or above.

  

## How will we get there?
