There’s some type of magic in referrals.

- 84% of B2B buyers begin their buying journey with a referral (Harvard Business Review)
- 92% of buyers trust referrals from people they know over any other source (Nielsen)
- Referred leads are 4x more likely to convert than cold leads (Nielsen)
- They close 2x faster, have 37% higher retention, and spend 16% more on average (Wharton School + Journal of Marketing)
- Referred customers are 2.5x more likely to refer others (Journal of Marketing)
- Only 30% of companies have a structured referral program (Heinz Marketing).

  

Most referrals don’t happen because you're making your contacts do all the heavy lifting.

Think about it: when's the last time someone recommended something to you? It's easy, high-trust, and incredibly effective—which is why referrals convert 4x better than cold outreach.

But here's the catch: Your request for referrals burdens your supporters with vague, open-ended requests. They're expected to instantly think of someone perfect for you and make the intro on the spot—with barely any context.

Enter andwho. Instead of vague asks, share a simple, secure link. Your contacts upload their network in under 2 minutes, and andwho's AI-agent takes over:

- Instantly scans their connections, informed by your specific context.
- Identifies the highest-potential introductions.
- Crafts a personalized, context-aware referral message that is easy for your contact to send.

No guesswork. Zero burden. Just referrals optimized for maximum impact.
