- We’re building the blockchain network that enables an ecosystem of AI-talent agents on the one side & AI-hiring agents on the other to figure out if a person is an ideal match for an opportunity.
- We all know that companies are becoming smaller & smaller which means cost of getting the wrong person is proportionally a lot higher as is the opportunity cost of not finding someone quickly enough. There’s a fundamental flaw with corporate networks that incentive noisy number games that will make it impossible for them to come up with a 100x more effective talent match - and building AI on top of these networks is like building faster horse.
- What we need is a car - and that looks like AI referring rather than recruiting. A referrer has done most of the work upfront to figure out if it’s a good match by having deep context on both sides & is staking it’s own credibility by referring that person.
- To build that ecosystem & blockchain network, you need a decentralised way to incentives production & validation of very rich talent & opportunity data - and makes that easily searchable for AI-agents - so that’s exactly what we’re building.
- Today we’ve built the two mechanisms that incentivise sharing & validating of deep context talent & opportunity data which we’re now using to help 3 communities, Developer_DAO, Myosin & Talent Protocol vet, manage & monetise their talent pool.
- Myosin for example is a marketing DAO with a 2% acceptance rate who’s used our talent-intake tools with AI-interviewer & staked vouching mechanism to determine their next cohort of social media managers.
- We envision building the talent coordination layer of the web - turning it into a lush garden of opportunities

  

Why does this need to be a blockchain network?

- There are many reason this needs to be a decentralised blockchain network are many but there are three that stand out
    - **this only works if you let the edges take care of compute:**  
        anyone, anywhere should be able to deploy such an agent to their own specifications given that a great match means something different in almost every case. Reputation for example is a run-time phenomenon: a Harvard diploma for me might be a signal for me but an anti-signal for you.  
        
    - **this only works if continuously producing information for your profile has no downside:**  
        every talent should be willing to invest deeply & consistently in sharing & updating that information as well as getting validated by peers & previous collaborators without fear of it being in vain due to de-platforming or being mis-represented with nowhere else to go  
        
    - **this only works if is a baked in cost to bad-acting/lying:**  
        There’s a paper that came out in 1973 written by Michael Spence called job market signaling & in it he concludes that the dominant strategy to get the job you want is to lie - we still haven’t solved this. Blockchain enabled skin-in-the-game mechanisms can help us nuance this through for example talent prediction market mechanisms - producing granular signals crucial for great matching.
