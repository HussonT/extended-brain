When’s the last time someone intro'ed you? Pretty awesome, right?

Referrals are so much more effective than cold outreach — but a lot of them never happen because we make them hard.

You’ve probably said something like, "If you know anyone, let me know!"

and gotten polite “Sure - I’ll have a think and get back to you”

Do they ever get back to you? Rarely - if ever.

It’s not bad intentions — it’s a heavy ask:

- They have to mentally scan their entire network on the spot
- Come up with an intro message for each person they can think of.
- All this with a fraction of the context that you have - so half the time they’re guessing if this could actually be a useful intro.

That’s where andwho comes in.

- Share a simple link
- Your contact connects their network in <2 minutes.
- AI finds the best fits and drafts ready-to-send, personalized intros for them.

No friction. No guesswork. Just 10 times more effortless, high-trust, win-win referrals that actually happen.

When's the last time someone recommended something to you? Pretty awesome right?

Referrals are powerful because they're built on trust - that trust makes them fast, easy & a lot more effective than cold outreach.

Now, imagine how much more high value deals you’d be able to close with 10 times the amount of trusted intros. Or how much faster you’d be able to hire the type of top tier talent that’s never looking for a job.

Here’s the thing, you can - but you’ve gotta fix one thing:

Stop making your contacts do the heavy lifting.

Think about it.

On your sales or recruitment calls, you've probably said something like, "Know anybody else I should talk to?" What's the usual reply? "I'll think about it and get back to you." Do they ever actually follow up? Rarely, if ever.

That’s such a missed opportunity - they’re willing to help but you’re making it very hard for them to do so.

You're asking them to mentally scan their network, pick relevant connections, and craft compelling messages, on the spot with a fraction of the context you have. That's a pretty massive barrier.

Enter andwho. Andwho make identifying, requesting & rewarding high impact intros frictionless:

- Share a simple link.
- Your contacts authenticate their network in less than 2 minutes.
- Andwho's AI scans their connections with your specific needs in mind.
- It identifies the best possible intros.
- And it drafts context-informed, ready-to-send referral messages.

Zero guesswork. Zero friction. Just effortless intros optimized for maximum impact, maintaining all the trust and effectiveness that make referrals work.

Let me show you how it works.

  

  

When's the last time someone recommended something to you? Pretty awesome right? It’s fast, easy & effective because of the trust & signal inherent in it. It’s also the reason referrals convert 4x better than cold outreach.

Imagine how much faster you’d hire top-performers and close high-ticket deals with even 10x the referrals you have today.

So what if I told you you’re leaving a minimum of that amount of high-impact referrals on the table - how?

By making your contacts do the heavy lifting.

Say you’re on a sales or recruitment call - and you hit them with the classic: Hey, if you think of anyone else I should talk to - let me know! What do they say? I’ll think about it and let you know! How often do they get back to you and actually let you know?

That’s such a missed opportunity. They just offered to help you but you made it super hard for them to do so by expecting them to mentally traverse their entire network, reach out to all the people that are relevant - not just the one that’s top of mind & write a message convincing them it’s worth taking a meeting with you with a fraction of the context that you have.

When’s the last time someone recommend you something?

It’s awesome right - it makes your decision so easy. That’s why referrals are 4x more likely to convert than any other form of outreach.

Do you have a referral strategy in place to sell and hire?

The problem stopping you from 10x’ing them is that you’re putting all the burden on the people making the referral. You’re asking the people that want to help you to think of an ideal person for you to meet when they have 1/100th of the context that you have.

That’s exactly the problem andwho solves - instead of keeping your question open & vague - you send a private link that lets the person who’s willing to help securely upload their network in under 2 minutes and the andwho ai-agent looks through their network with all the context you’ve given it to find the most likely to convert intros. With all that context in mind, it writes the perfect referral message.

0-burden, 100-warm intro power.

  

  

  

  

But in today’s noisy, algorithm-driven GTM world, referrals often feel like an afterthought, something that “just happens” if the product is good enough. Here’s the truth: Referrals don’t just happen; they’re earned, nurtured, and, when done right, systematically unlocked.

  

So what’s stopping you from

10x-ing the number of referrals you get? It’s putting all the burden on the people that could maker referrals.

  

Referrals Are Your Revenue Unlock  
The most overlooked GTM channel is right under your nose  

  
We’ve all heard the saying, “Your network is your net worth.” But in today’s noisy, algorithm-driven GTM world, referrals often feel like an afterthought, something that “just happens” if the product is good enough. Here’s the truth: Referrals don’t just happen; they’re earned, nurtured, and, when done right, systematically unlocked.  

  
The highest quality pipeline often doesn’t come from outbound prospecting or flashy ad campaigns. It comes from the people who already trust you, who you’ve delivered value to. Referrals aren’t just warm leads; they’re pre-sold relationships. And in an environment where CAC is rising and sales cycles are lengthening, this is the playbook move most companies are leaving on the bench.  

  
According to Nielsen, 92% of consumers trust referrals from people they know. And in B2B? A referred lead is 4x more likely to convert, with a 16% higher lifetime value. So, why aren’t more companies building referral motions into their GTM strategy?  

  
This week’s newsletter is about changing that. We’re breaking down why referrals are the real revenue unlock, how to build a repeatable referral flywheel, and what early-stage startups and scaling teams can do to turn customers, partners, and even former prospects into consistent deal sources.  

  

The GTM Truth  
Let’s get real for a minute. Any time you are looking to implement and execute your GTM strategy, it all starts good, then it can go sideways quickly, and you start chasing the following:  
Sales is scrambling to hit numbers.  
Marketing is chasing MQLs with diminishing returns.  
Leadership wants more pipeline — faster.  
So, what do most teams do?  
Increase ad spending  
Buy another list  
Hire more SDRs  
Roll out a new outbound sequence.  
And they completely ignore the one channel that consistently outperforms them all: REFERRALS.  
📊 Consider this if you are still skeptical:  
84% of B2B buyers begin their buying journey with a referral (Harvard Business Review)  
92% of buyers trust referrals from people they know over any other source (Nielsen)  
Referred leads are 4x more likely to convert than cold leads (Nielsen)  
They close 2x faster, have 37% higher retention, and spend 16% more on average (Wharton School + Journal of Marketing)  
Referred customers are 2.5x more likely to refer others (Journal of Marketing)  
Yet, only 30% of companies have a structured referral program (Heinz Marketing).  
These are unbelievable statistics; however, this is similar to what we see when we work with companies at Revenue Reimagined.  
It’s not just a missed opportunity — it’s a GTM Gap that’s costing you deals, time, and momentum.  
This newsletter breaks down how to operationalize referrals into a scalable, repeatable part of your GTM motion — and why doing so is one of the smartest moves you can make in 2025.  
  

The GTM Play: Building a Referral Flywheel

  
Referrals are too often treated like happy accidents. A customer makes an unsolicited introduction, a past client refers a peer, or an advisor sends someone your way, and everyone celebrates. But after that… silence. Weeks or months go by without another warm lead, and the pipeline engine goes back to grinding through outbound sequences and cold campaigns.  
This is the root problem: most GTM leaders believe in the value of referrals but fail to treat them like a channel. They assume referrals “just happen,” when in reality, they should be built into your GTM strategy and measured just as your outbound or paid acquisition. When designed intentionally, referrals become a compounding growth system: a flywheel that spins faster with every success.  

  
Let’s walk through how to build a Referral Flywheel — a repeatable, compounding system that grows with every closed deal and delighted customer.  

  
**Step 1: Map Your Referral Network**  
Start by identifying “trust capital” — the people in your network who already believe in what you do and want to see you win.  
This includes:  
- Current customers with measurable ROI  
Past clients with positive experiences  
Advisors and investors with network reach  
Strategic partners who sell to similar buyers  
Former employees who respect the brand  
Friends and peers in your professional network  
This is your referral asset list, and it’s the most underutilized resource in your company.  
💡 Companies that actively engage their referral network see up to 86% more revenue growth than those that don’t (Influitive + Heinz).  
Action step: Create a “Referral Champions” view in your CRM or Airtable. Tag each person by ICP fit, relationship strength, and referral likelihood. This becomes your warm pipeline and your first-party channel for trust-driven growth.  

**Step 2: Target with Intent**  
You don’t need a hundred referrals. You need the right 5 to 10.  
The key is precision. Not everyone should be asked to refer. Instead, focus on:  
Who knows your ideal customer?  
Who has social credibility in your industry?  
Who has seen your value firsthand?  
Just like ABM lite, referrals require segmentation and personalization. Score your potential referrers by:  
ICP proximity  
Relationship strength  
Referral history  
Likelihood of follow-through  
💡Referred leads convert 4x higher than cold outreach and close in half the time (Nielsen). That’s a pipeline accelerator, not a top-of-funnel experiment.  

**Step 3: Make the Ask Frictionless**  
Referrals die when the ask is too vague or too difficult.  
“Know anyone who could use our platform?” is a great way to get ghosted.  
Instead, reduce friction with context and clarity:  
Identify a specific person or role they might know  
Draft a short, forwardable message  
Frame the value of the intro for both sides  

  
Example message:  
“Hey [Name], I saw you’re connected to [Prospect Name] at [Company]. We’ve helped similar teams reduce onboarding time by 30% using [Your Platform]. Would it be helpful if I sent over a quick message you could forward?”  
That’s it. No decks. No long briefs. Just trust and simplicity.  
💡 Referred customers cost 50–70% less to acquire and retain 37% longer than non-referred customers (Wharton).  

  
Pro tip: Store blurb templates in your enablement/knowledge library. Give your team ready-made copy for customers, partners, and investors and make it part of your GTM toolkit.  

  

**Step 4: Reward the Behavior — Not Just the Result**  
Too many companies only reward referrals when deals close.  
That’s a mistake. The act of referring is where the value begins, not the signature on a contract.  
Celebrate it early and often:  
Send a handwritten thank-you note or a voice message  
Publicly recognize your advocate on LinkedIn (if appropriate)  
Provide early access to a new feature or exclusive roadmap updates  
Offer light incentives for repeat referrers, but keep it personal, not transactional  
💡Referred customers are 16% more profitable and 2.5x more likely to refer others (Journal of Marketing). That’s your flywheel kicking in.  

**Step 5: Measure and Multiply**  
If you want referrals to scale, measure them like any other growth channel.  
  

Track:  
Referral sources and conversion rates  
Time-to-close and win rate  
LTV and retention of referred customers  
Number of referrals per advocate  
Cost per referral-sourced opportunity  
Ask yourself:  
Who are your highest-performing referral partners?  
Which messages convert best?  
What referral moments happen naturally — and how can you amplify them?  
Pro Tip: Add “Referral Velocity” as a GTM KPI—how many warm intros your org generates per month or quarter. Assign ownership to someone on your team and review it like pipeline stages.  
This turns referrals from random to reliable — and from anecdotal to scalable.  

At its core, a referral flywheel is about creating momentum. One customer becomes a fan and refers a peer, and that peer becomes a customer and does the same. Each cycle reinforces the last. It’s not linear; it’s exponential. And best of all, it’s built on something no competitor can replicate: your reputation.  
Referrals aren’t a growth hack. They’re the most scalable form of trust — and your most underrated go-to-market asset.  

  
Real Story: The Taco Trust Effect  
Yesterday, I was on a college tour with my son, Colten, at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. After the tour, we were starving. Instead of scrolling through Yelp or Google Maps, I did what most of us would do—I texted someone I trust: Dale Dupree.  
His answer?  
“Hunger Street Tacos. No question.”  
No hesitation. No overthinking. Just a confident referral (and it was just down the street)  
It turns out Dale knew the owners personally. They had spent 15+ years as missionaries in Mexico and learned how to cook from locals. They brought that passion and authenticity back to Winter Park—and the food was incredible.  
But here’s the point: I didn’t need to be convinced. I didn’t look for options. I didn’t need a second opinion. However, an interesting fact is that if Dale had not given me the recommendation, I would have driven right past the restaurant (in fact, I did when we first drove to Rollins in the morning)  
The trust transfer had already happened.  
That’s what referrals do.  
They collapse the sales cycle.  
They shortcut doubt.  
They create confidence before your first conversation even starts.
