Hi {{first_name}},

We‚Äôre excited for 2024 - we‚Äôve been able to turn our first couple of job-slots sold into momentum that we can grow & sustain by shifting our focus to high-value partnerships.

In October, Developer DAO gave the go-ahead to replace the existing pallet job-board with a prototype of our AI-enabled, community focussed job-board. November, we started selling job slots. This confirmed the demand & willingness to pay from web3 orgs to more effectively tap into talent sources that communities like Developer DAO can provide targeted distribution for. However, in the limit selling job-slots is a volume-driven, transactional service. Growing this to hit seed-round metrics would require time & investments in marketing that we currently don‚Äôt have the resources for + does not showcase the full potential of the product that we‚Äôve built.

Instead, we've repackaged that core value prop into [a specialized SaaS tool for web3 recruiters & hiring managers](https://pitch.com/v/Eden-source-talent-in-online-communities-investors-ze4qnu) who want to turn online communities into their private talent clouds. These are higher LTV partnerships that lead to a more recurring/compounding relationship with our customers - which also means more & faster learning for us.

We've booked sales-demos with big players in the web3 space (Polygon, Alchemy, Avara, Head of platforms at web3 vcs such as Coinfund & Figment as well as various crypto-recruiters). Add to that that the web3 space is, for lack of a better word, vibing. BTC > $40k. üëÄ and we're gearing up to ride that wave.

  

üìà **Asks:**

- Intros to web3 professionals interested in sourcing talent from [Developer DAO](https://www.developerdao.com/) (5,000 web3 devs). Ideally Hiring Managers at web3 scaleups who are actively hiring (chaos labs, Nethermind, Biconomy, Uniswap, basically any of the companies on here: [https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/engineering/](https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/engineering/)) head of platforms/talent at web3 VCs or crypto-focused recruiters.

üìà **Key Metrics:**

- **10 Job-slots sold**: [https://www.edenprotocol.app/developer-dao/jobs](https://www.edenprotocol.app/developer-dao/jobs) - but stopped actively selling them ourselves and put our efforts on going after partnerships. Developer DAO continues selling the job slots through their partnerships team with a 20% take rate for us on every slot they sell. We think of these more as a land-and-expand strategy.
- **312 people did an interview** through Eden.

üëç **Highlights:**

- We‚Äôve got a very exciting new blockchain-based feature that we‚Äôre working on: multi-player referrals - more about that next time.
- Developer DAO started selling Eden job slots for their own conto - the more people selling Eden the better!

üëé **Lowlights:**

- We forfeited robustness of the product for speed of development. This caught up with us the last month. It led to a better staging <> production process & we're working with QA testers to make sure we don't have the product break in key customer interactions.

üè¶ **Financials:**

- **Cash balance: $255K ( 20% is allocated in $BTC & 5% in ETH)**
    - Burn ~ $10K
    - One-time yearly bookkeeping, taxfiling + legal costs ~ 25K
    - Runway ~ 24 months

**üõ† Product:**

- [https://www.edenprotocol.app/developer-dao/jobs](https://www.edenprotocol.app/developer-dao/jobs) (try it out the interview & ping me if you'd like to launch a job to the Developer DAO community)
- The feedback from talent taking the interview has been super positive: the hypothesis that talent is willing to do an interview with an AI is very confirmed & that we are able to get a lot more signal from a full interview like that over a simple resume or LinkedIn profile is also clear. We have a vision for how we can make AI initial interviews the preferred way to interact with potential opportunities, more about that later.

- Our next frontier is figuring out how we to get passive talent involved in the network with a couple of clear experiments set to launch in the next couple of weeks.
