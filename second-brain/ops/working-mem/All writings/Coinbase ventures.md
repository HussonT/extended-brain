I think it’s crazy that 85% of the workforce is emotionally disengaged. Not only does that result in us being worse friends, family, parents & partners, it literally comes with 7 trillion USD in lost productivity. This is not even factoring in the opportunity cost that comes with this huge labour market inefficiency that results in us getting the wrong person on the wrong project for the wrong reasons at a massive scale.

However, we’re on the brink of a transition from this old industrial workforce paradigm with rigid, pre-defined roles to the internet workforce paradigm with flexible, purpose led projects - all that is missing are the tools to successfully make that happen.

We’ve had key socio-economic (covid, quiet quitting, …), technological (AI & Blockchain maturing) & regulatory/policy (gig economy workers act, regulatory progress w crypto - thanks Brian!!) inflection points that gave us the skills & mindset to make the leap to this new internet native work model. This trend can be seen in phenomena like GenZ quitting their current jobs without having another job secured, simply because they are dissatisfied, as well as the fact that 50% of the workforce is projected to freelance by 2027.

The days of 40 year careers at one company are long gone and people want to work on projects with passion. Can you imagine how much better the world would be if we helped everybody find (co)-work(ers) they love?

I've been founding talent & technology-related startups since 2015 with an exit in 2021. My life-goal is to become a founder with the skill, heart & mindset to impact a billion+ people’s lives positively. Leading up to the exit, I had an existential crisis because I realised that the consultancy I built was only delivering a linear impact. So I shifted my focus to where I think game-changing, billion-impact companies come to life: right at the crossroads of these big turning points in society.

I'm interested in tackling this challenge because, honestly, I can't think of a more critical issue than how people choose to spend 1/3 of their lives. The choices we make in this area not only shape our own destinies but have an outsized impact on those around us and the broader community.

We’re building a prototype of 3 of the 11 ideas Brian talked about in his tweet - we’re currently testing & iterating those within Developer DAO. Our internal talent <> project marketplace that has an AI powered matching engine is live. We use LLMs to “interview” D_D members & captures broad context about talent & opportunities in order to match with more precision. We use a blockchain based reputation staking mechanism to determine credibility of both talent & opportunity. Bringing these context & credibility markers together empowers us to create what we envision as the future of professional networking—moving beyond "check out my LinkedIn profile." and moving towards "talk to my Eden AI.”

  

  

I've been thinking about signal theory, credibility markers and trust in hiring. Putting “trust on chain” as such may not work since trust is a personal emotion that builds up over time. However, credibility markers can be put on chain. Credibility markers are the primitives that lead to trust. For example, Harvard provides a credibility token like a diploma. How much a person trusts that credibility token & by proxy the holder of that token depends on their world view. Say for example somebody associates people going to harvard with being stuck-up know it alls, that credibility marker now has the opposite effect. This made me realise that trust is a runtime phenomenon.

By thinking about it in that way - I see AI & Crytpo play hand in hand here. Blockchain is the platform for the primitives, AI helps with the runtime compute on what is trustworthy according to your “trust config”.
