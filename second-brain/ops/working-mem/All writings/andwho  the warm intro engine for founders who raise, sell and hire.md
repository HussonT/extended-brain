Alright - here’s a secret. Warm intros rule the world. Ok I guess it’s not really a secret. What is a secret though is that we’ve built a tool that lets you request thoughtful intros from your warm network, at scale.

In this demo you’ll see how we’ve been able to take all of the grunt-work out of requesting intros without losing any of the signal that make them work.

I’ll show you how easy it is to have friends, customers and investors share their network - no more endless scrolling through LinkedIn connections to find potentially relevant intros to then realize that they don’t know each-other at all.

Which means I’ll show you how andwho helps you ask for the most likely to convert intros with it’s influence estimate so you can be thoughtful about your ask.

And finally I’ll show you how easy andwho makes it to make the intros actually convert.
