Are you technical? Can you write code?*

What superpower will you contribute to the team?*

My true strength lies in building relationships, selling & recruiting. At some point we had 30+ contributors from Developer DAO helping with building Eden, contributing 15h+/week out of sheer excitement for the vision - (we‚Äôve since scaled that team down because the coordination was slowing us down).

Additional superpowers are that I learn things insanely fast, am incredibly dedicated (I‚Äôve joined a founder residency called brickyard in Chattanooga where I work 6.5/7 from 6 am to 8 pm on Eden - even shaved my head so dating couldn‚Äôt be a distraction ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) & can translate the customers‚Äô needs into a coherent, actionable & deep technical vision + spec docs while inspiring, aligning & selling all stakeholders on our core vision of a world where everyone gets to find their people & love their work.

I have a degree in Computer Science & have learned to do everything (product, UX/UI design, code,‚Ä¶) myself decent enough over the years building 4 startups by reading, taking courses & surrounding myself with a network of pros who rarely say no to help me out. I can code enough such that I‚Äôve been able to help ship the MVP we have today, but I‚Äôm aware there are way better coders out there.

In what year did you first create a public blockchain wallet?

2016

What is the most impressive thing you‚Äôve ever done?*

I dropped out of my masters in Computer Science at 21 to build + scale my HR-innovation agency ( https://humain.ai ) where I lead many projects ranging from implementing AI to predicting employee churn to anticipating skill demand based on market trends for multinationals & EU-level government orgs. Getting those contracts required breaking into network events I wasn‚Äôt invited to & outselling established players such as Deloitte & Accenture at 1/5 the experience of some of the partners I was up against. I sold this agency at 25 (i.e. the methods & client portfolio I developed). I did all this while having become a dad at 19 to a daughter that lived on the other side of the world.

It has to be that or the 2 years of travel I did out of high school with $0 to my name, working odd jobs along the way in farms & cafe‚Äôs all around the world. Have learned to trust my own resourcefulness to get myself sorted.

  

Describe a time in your personal or professional life when you failed at something. What did you learn from the experience and what would you do differently if faced with a similar situation again?*

At 19, I got a call from a 10-year-older woman that I had a one night stand with informing me that I was going to be a dad. She lived in Tucson, AZ with a life where a little kiddo would fit perfectly. I was back in Belgium, starting my CS studies after travelling the world for 2 years and living a life where the closest horizon that I could see kids, was in 15 years. I was terrified of what everyone would think: I went from being the high-school council president to being the guy with the kid at 19. For the months leading up to her birth, I wallowed in shame & became suicidal. I felt like I failed everyone‚Äôs expectations of me, including my own.

My suicidal thoughts came to a point where I asked myself: ‚ÄúAre you in or are you out? But if you‚Äôre out, end it tonight. If you‚Äôre in - then be f*cking in.‚Äù I decided to be in. The next morning I started looking for books, youtube videos, whatever I could find to help myself get out of this. That led me down a rabbit hole of self-development & turned (personal)growth into one of my single biggest core-values. Quickly I found out that books could only teach you so much & turned to building businesses as the best way to keep my learning curve super steep. It thought me that you can grow yourself out of any challenging situation. I‚Äôm now on company #4 with one of my companies acquired in 2021.

Now, when I face a huge setback or disappointment I use a broad toolbox like meditation, journaling, ‚Ä¶ to regulate my own emotions quickly & then figure out what I need to do, who I need to talk to, to outgrow this setback. I operate from a deep knowing & gratitude that this is actually an opportunity to grow. The advantage I have is that I‚Äôve touched rock bottom & know that If you just keep laying brick, eventually, you can outgrow any hard situation.

Despite being in Tucson a month each year for her birthday, calling every weekend and very aware & involved in her life that way as well as never having missed a child support payment while having had times where I personally struggled to pay rent, the on-paper choice I‚Äôm making, is building companies over being a physically present dad. I can‚Äôt let that choice be in vain. There is no way I can look my daughter in the eye and say ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt there because I tried to become a founder of a generation defining company‚Äù. I‚Äôm way past trying - I‚Äôm doing.

==Describe your project. How will it capture value?*==

We‚Äôre building trustworthy AI that refers talent & opportunities on crypto rails.

Few people like recruiters, most people love a thoughtful referral. The world doesn‚Äôt need more LinkedIn DMs powered by AI-automated recruitment flows, it needs a way to scale the best talent allocation paradigm we know: referral level matching at a global scale.

Our AI is called Eden and we‚Äôre leveraging the latest in AI, XAI & Blockchain to build a bias-aware AI-experience that‚Äôs like talking to that go-to friend with a huge network, known to make referrals that you can trust blindly. Anybody with a talented audience can get rewarded for introducing great talent to Eden. Talent validators like mentors, ex-coworkers or peers can get rewarded for producing relevant hiring signals for peer-talent through reputation-staked-vouching. Introducers & vouchers get a talent key for each talent they introduce or vouch for. When that talent ends up getting hired through the Eden network, the hiring bounty is distributed over all the talent-key holders. This incentivises high-quality talent liquidity & meaningful talent verification respectively - this allows for a very different game-theoretic dominant strategy than the recruiter driven hiring-bounty platforms you might already be familiar with.

We capture value by taking a % of every transaction enabled through the Eden network, the most important transaction being the hiring bounty that is put in escrow - additionally there‚Äôs the talent-key buying etc. We‚Äôll also offer a monthly subscription for super-users who want to access pro-features.

Our vision is to build the decentralised talent & opportunity network optimised for AI-agents. Imagine a slack-plug in that anticipates talent needs & plugs into the Eden network to find the ideal candidates in minutes or a VR-AI-avatar that‚Äôs configured to an orgs needs, that is present on every call regarding staffing & can plug into the Eden network to find the perfect match in minutes.
