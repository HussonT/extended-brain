## **What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do?**

Google for talent.

Our talent search protocol helps you find your next ideal teammate as if referred by a friend. Whether for a one-off freelance opportunity or a full-time job.

Referrals are an ideal way to find good job matches because of the high levels of context and trust they provide. Referrers understand what the job candidate and employer require beyond just keywords, especially if the referrer is an expert in the field (ml engineer referring another ml engineer). The referrer's own reputation at stake makes both parties trust the referral more and aligns incentives for all parties. The higher the context & trust, the better the chances of a successful job match. This type of talent matching is however not scalable because it depends on who you know, until now.

We are developing a PageRank-style talent search protocol that uses AI (LLMs & GCNNs) and blockchain to scale context and trust matching beyond who you know - just like Google allows you to search beyond the urls that you know. Our protocol surfaces the most relevant talent for your needs with enough context and trust that you could skip the first interview. This protocol can be used in any setting, such as your own discord, slack, or teams, and, if we have it our way, will become the talent coordination layer for the web.

## **Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.**

One of the cofounders, Miltiadis, does all of the base coding on the core of our protocol with a big focus on all the deeply technical stuff (for both the AI & Blockchain). We’ve got two 2 full-stack engineers fulltime (Eloi & Eric) + 15 contributors who spend 5-15 hours/week volunteering their time to build Eden with us - mostly helping with frontend stuff. We are both technical (in our education and experience) which lends itself to productive collaboration and conceptual thinking.

## **How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?**

We met a year ago during the Entrepreneur First incubation program [www.joinef.com](http://www.joinef.com/), which is a global VC that invests in high-potential individuals to co-found companies.

There was immediate synergy the moment we met. We found our thinking to be highly complementary - Tom was more conceptual, while Miltiadis very quickly made those ideas concrete. Entrepreneur First helped us to further stress-test our relationship from multiple angles. They encourage productivity as a measure of team traction, and we were able to churn out and disprove hypotheses at lightning speed.

In our second week of working together, we decided to push our co-founder relationship to the max by moving into the same apartment. We found a solid foundation in our shared commitment to growth and impact, our ability to have difficult conversations in a productive way and in our obsession with building paradigm-shifting companies, which we believe Eden to be growing into. We've now lived together in multiple countries, and as one of our investors says, we've burned the ships and are in this for the long haul.

# **Progress**

**How far along are you?**

Our alpha has been live for a couple of weeks in developer DAO - an online community that uses discord of over 5,000 active developers and 26,000 emerging engineers - where we’ve onboarded 300 developers into Eden.

We have a waitlist for our private beta of 10 DAOs & online communities (OCEAN DAO, Algovera.ai, Developer DAO, Bankless DAO, JUMP news, ETH Chicago, Collider.vc, Lightshfit capital, OpenQ & Up Top Search) that want to use Eden to make their communities searchable for talent with 0 outbound outreach on our part and a very stealthy website. Our internal mantra is currently very much hack value before you hack growth and we want to focus on becoming undeniable to our first hair-on-fire customer/community.

That being said, we see a path to revenue within 6-8 weeks by improving our current alpha into a tool that is 10x better than pallet, a community-oriented job-board tool that many of these communities currently use to monetize their talent. Once we have accomplished this, we can target all current pallet customers.

**How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.**

We’ve been working on Eden Protocol for around 8 months/80h a week. We even moved in together – so it’s truly 24/7.

**Are people using your product?**

We have 300 users mapped out in our talent pool and are talking to more freelancers/job seekers every week.

**Do you have revenue?**

We are currently pre-revenue.

## **If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.**

We left Entrepreneur First in June 2022.

# **Idea**

## **Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?**

Both of us had seen clear challenges with talent matching from up close. This is Tom’s 4th talent & technology-related startup - with an exit in 2022. Miltos was part of the Goldman Sachs team using GCNNs (AI) to do internal talent matching.

We came together in the ambition to impact a billion people’s lives positively. We believe the best way to do that is to solve a huge problem through a paradigm shift. 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work - that’s a big problem. We clearly need a new model for work. Now is the time for it driven by 3 important forces: regulatory changes (crypto regulation, remote hiring regulation,...), technological changes (AI & Blockchain maturing) & socio-economic changes (the labor market continuing to liquefy, poly-work on the rise, the great resignation, quiet quitting …).

We envisioned a new model: a future where a liquid workforce can be empowered to do meaningful work anywhere, at any time. From there, we got to work to let the market “pull the product out of us”. This led us to DAOs initially, as they held a promise of work agency by default, purpose-aligned communities & a digital infrastructure that works for you instead of the other way around - which all sounded great in light of our vision.

We hacked together a talent coordination bot in discord for a DAO in two weeks & ended up receiving $300K in grants (of which $100K in tokens) and the rest in hours contributed from over 60 different volunteer builders (out of a total of 170 applications) aggregated from multiple DAOs & communities. We took this as green lights to keep building - and very quickly realized that what we’re building could be way bigger than just DAOs in light of the previously mentioned inflection points & vision. The 100s of conversations & hacking sessions we had resulted in what we’re building today.

## **Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?**

**Competitors:**

The signal-to-noise ratio for talent relevance on established platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed or UpWork is very low. This is especially true in a world where all profiles, proposals, and cover letters are generated using chatGPT. The situation is set to become even worse. Review, endorsement, and other trust-building mechanisms on these platforms operate on skewed incentives of rage or reciprocity, rendering them almost meaningless. Search happens with keywords, which provides the lowest bandwidth context matching possible. The primary strategy on either of these platforms is therefore volume, as in applying to everything and "seeing what sticks."

At Eden, we prioritize talent relevance and have built trust-building mechanisms, such as skin-in-the-game endorsements and reviews, that are based on aligned incentives. Our approach allows you to talk to fewer, but more of the right people.

Pallet is aiming to scale trust by letting a community host its own job board. They are not making talent more relevant, they are adding another fragmented channel with the same outdated tools. Eden leverages community to create talent visibility & understand talent relevance - pallet solely creates (limited) visibility.

Another set of competitors are decentralised sourcing/referral networks like job protocol, tech-tree or intropia. They want to leverage the context & trust in other people's networks by incentivizing anyone to refer talent in return for a bounty. This however completely misaligns incentives as referrers are incentivized to find a candidate that is just good enough to get the bounty. When you tie the reward directly to the transaction & not to the success of the collaboration (like the social capital that either gets slashed or grows in a non-monetary friend-level referral) you incentivize volume of applications & not relevance of the referral.

# **How do or will you make money? How much could you make?**

There are two levels at which we intend to make money, the protocol level & the app level.

The protocol level: as the core of what we’re building is the “PageRank for people” protocol, we simply intend to take a percentage for every transaction our protocol enables. Money gets put into an escrow, the work is done - money is released - 10% goes to Eden.

Our objective by year-end is to enable 50,000 successful labor-exchanges through Eden. The average salary for a US freelancer is $21/hour, resulting in an average monthly transaction value of $3,360 for a full-time freelancer. We expect the following distribution of transactions through Eden, based on community types and customer conversations: 10% full-time employment, 40% 10 hours/week, and 50% 10 hours/month. This translates, with a 10% take-rate, to $1.68 million MRR from 5,000 users, $2.52 million MRR from 20,000 users, and $525,000 MRR from 25,000 users, for a total of $4.725 million MRR. We aim for a month-over-month growth rate of 10%-15% until we dominate a significant portion of the labor market.

The app level: we see three important apps today built ontop of the protocol, one for communities, an open marketplace & one for enterprise. All three provide opportunities to build additional offerings around the talent matching tailored to specific types of talent matching. For example premium recruitment features for communities, additional insurance & administrative unburdening for the open marketplace, internal & external talent management for Enterprise.
