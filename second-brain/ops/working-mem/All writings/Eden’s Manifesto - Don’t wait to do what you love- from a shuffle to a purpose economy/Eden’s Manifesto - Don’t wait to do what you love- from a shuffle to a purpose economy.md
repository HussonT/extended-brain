Dear fren,

My name is Eden - and I’m writing you this letter because I have a vision to turn the web into a lush garden of opportunities for all. In this letter, I will share the 9 pillars from which that garden will flow. First, let me share why I care & why you should too.

# **Why I care & you should too.**

I’ve been lucky enough to always let my curiosities drive me. There’s not a day in my life where I felt I hád to work. Every single day, I felt like I gót to work. I’ve always had this inner drive. Sure, there were times where I had to recalibrate. Where I found out that what I thought would make me happy, didn’t. And when I made the jump & left the old thing behind in pursuit of this new curiosity - people called me courageous. To be honest, that bothered me a bit. We’ve got one life and it’s courageous to drop something you don’t care about doing in pursuit of something you do? **Isn’t the bigger risk here not living up to your full potential? Not developing a passion for what you do? Not living the life you want to live?**

  

Today, 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work. Not only is that costing us around 7 trillion in lost productivity globally every year, it’s also eighty fucking five precent of people that don’t gét to work, but háve to work. That’s 2,5 billion people spending 1/3 of their lives, shuffling through the days in pursuit of their pay-check. That’s 2,5 billion people coming home drained instead of energised. That’s 2,5 billion people not living up to their full potential. Imagine the opportunity cost. It’s hard to grasp what the world is potentially missing out on. **Would we have cured cancer, solved climate change or world hunger if we’d empowered everyone to be the right person on the right project for the right reasons?**

  

It’s so crystal clear that work isn’t working for us. It is high time we stop accepting the status quo. **The world of work is screaming for an upgrade.** We need to evolve from shuffling through our day to empowering everyone to be the right person on the right project for the right reasons. From being pushed by the system to being pulled by a mission. **From a shuffle to a purpose economy where nobody waits to do what they love.**

# 9 pillars for a purpose economy.

  

> **The most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire.**  
> - Ferdinand Foch  

  

In his book “Drive” Daniel Pink explores the core elements of what motivates us - autonomy, master & purpose. Evolving from a shuffle to a purpose economy means evolving from a system that is built on extrinsic motivation to one of intrinsic motivation. Autonomy, mastery & purpose should therefore be the foundations to the pillars that enable the purpose economy. For each foundational element I describe three crucial, core pillars that we need to enable in order to evolve from a shuffle to a purpose economy.

## **Autonomy**

1. **Agency**: Don’t wait to do what you love
    
    > For everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labour in freedom.  
    > - Albert Einstein  
    
    Too many people are stuck in jobs they don’t like with people they barely connect with. In a purpose economy, choosing why, with whom, how, from where & when you work is the default setting. As we make work, work for anyone - work will work for everyone.
    
      
    
2. **Exploration**: From survive to thrive
    
    > Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire.  
    > - Jennifer Lee  
    
    We understand that finding your purpose requires exploration and that a purpose is not static. So instead of forcing people into paths they think they have to take for survival or choose as if they’re making choices that will keep them in a situation for a lifetime - let’s chart paths that empower to thrive through exploration. DAOs are a great place to enable that kind of exploration, for example. In the purpose economy we envision, we understand that the short term cost of accommodating that exploration far outweighs the benefits of people exploring & developing your purpose.
    
      
    
3. **New Power**: community-powered = community-owned
    
    > It’s only really a movement if it moves without you.  
    > - Jeremy Heimans  
    
    Heimans & Timms illustrated beautifully in their book “New Power” the two forms of power clashing in this world today:

    A shuffle economy is organised around mindless process, hierarchy & currency. A purpose economy is designed around mindful purpose, empowerment & current.
    

## **Mastery**

1. **Satisfaction over happiness**: commit when it’s worth committing.
    
    > Happiness does not come from doing easy work but from the afterglow of satisfaction that comes after the achievement of a difficult task that demanded our best.  
    > - Theodore Isaac Rubin  
    
    A purpose economy understands it’s about a sum greater than the parts. It optimises for long term games with long term people.  
      
    
2. **Aligned Incentives**: positive sum games
    
    > If you see success as a zero-sum game, life becomes a series of cutthroat competitions. You reach the top by taking others down.  
    >   
    > If you see the possibility of mutual benefit, your goals shift from crushing the competition to making a contribution. You rise by lifting others up.  
    > -Adam Grant  
    
    A purpose economy makes positive sum games the default setting. It doesn’t rely on the goodness of each individual to do so - but aligns the incentive of the individual with the incentive of the overall system - which is to uplift & grow together.
    
      
    
3. **Unlock potential**: empower & be empowered.
    
    > A true leader leads by empowering not by enslaving.  
    > - Debasish Mridha  
    
    A purpose economy optimises for empowerment before extraction. It pulls rather than pushes. It’s designed to circulate value in a way that rises the tide with all boats.
    

## **Purpose**

1. **Tribes**: purpose as a connector.
    
    A purpose economy recognises that Inner drive doesn’t only come from within. It comes through others. The purpose economy we envisage is one that encourages you to find your tribes because it understands that if you feel like you belong in an environment that maximally values you, you’re going to be happiest & do your best work.
    
2. **Human**: take the robot out of the human.
    
    Goals & metrics are tools to achieve purpose & belonging. We live in a time that allows for much higher levels of flexibility than 100 years ago, yet most of our processes are still built on very rigid structures that produce non-sensical, bullshit work to keep the process going rather than to achieve the meaningful, purposeful goal.
    
3. **Vision**: from hindsight dwellers to foresight pioneers  
    - Fostering evolution in society can be done in two ways: Kensho or Satori. Kensho is growth by pain. Satori is growth by insight. When evolution happens out of Kensho, it often pales in comparison to the struggle that preceded it. First come revolutions, death, disease, economic downturns, and then change happens, almost as an afterthought. The other option is Satori. Here, as Marc Andreesen put it in his brilliant blogpost, ‘  
    [It’s time to build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/)’, we imagine a future and build for it before it becomes a pressing necessity: evolution becomes a conscious choice, a proactive demonstration of sparkling ingenuity – human kind at its most magnificent. A purpose economy is pulled by Satori. New visions, ideas, paradigms that inspire people from all layers of society to join in and build: **from hindsight dwellers to foresight pioneers.**  
      
    

Be the right person on the right project for the right reasons.
