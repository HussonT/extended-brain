Preferred working time zone? *(For each founder in UTC timezone)MSTCETCompany Description *Describe what your company does in 250 characters or less.In a world where work is increasingly fractionalized and the workforce becomes more liquid, we need faster, cheaper & more accurate talent matches. Eden is building AI & blockchain-powered protocol tools that make talent searches & matches across the web hyper-relevant, fast & cheap. Company Vision *Today, 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work and it takes an average of 41 days to fill a position. That roughly translates to "many people are stuck working on the wrong project for the wrong reasons". This is what we at Eden call, the "shuffle economy". Where people shuffle through their days, uninspired, unengaged - waiting for the clock to strike 5. We believe it's time to evolve from the shuffle economy into the purpose economy. Here, people are mainly intrinsically motivated. People are inspired, engaged & fully valued as they have all the tools at their disposal to be & find the right person for the right project with the right reasons. Our vision is to turn the web into a lush garden of opportunities. Hence the name Eden. Our mission is to build Google meets Uber for talent search & matching. Once we succeed in doing that, everybody will be empowered to have complete work agency & companies will be able to attract the most aligned & engaged people - making work, work for them instead of the other way around. What are the long-term ambitions for your company? *¬†**1**  
Impacting a billion+ people's lives positively by providing access to better, more meaningful opportunities. Who is your customer and what problem are you solving for them? *Our beach-head market is web3 with a focus on DAOs, Hackathons & Protocols. Very-high level we're solving talent attraction, engagement & retention problems for all 3. More specifically for each: - DAOs: DAOs are big, black boxes when it comes to understanding what talent is present in the DAO. This makes it very hard to meaningfully engage talent & help people find their spot in the DAO. For developer DAO specifically, we did a survey and found that only 1/10 new joiners that want to contribute, actually get to contribute. This leads to a death spiral for the DAO as many people disengage from the DAO. No engaged people = no impactful DAO. We solve a lot of these problems by having tooling that makes talent meaningfully searchable & engageable across the DAO. Facilitating first paths to contribution & reengaging "lurkers" for the right reasons.- Hackathons: For hackathons, team formation is hardly solved despite the success of the hackathon being directly correlated with the number of successful teams that form & keep building after the hackathon. You're either all put in a room together a couple of hours before the hackathon starts or you post who you are in a discord channel & hope for the best. This often leads to teams that are very unbalanced when it comes to overall skillset. (all Devs no PMs, all designers no devs,...) We solve a lot of these problems by building tooling that makes talent meaningfully searchable & engageable before & during the hackathon. - Protocols: Protocols want to incentivize builders to build on top of their stack. However today their best bets are to give out grants through a grants program or bounties on hackathons. It is however very time and therefore money intensive to find & engage the right builders. A lot of grant money is spent on team that shouldn't have gotten them and a lot of bounty money doesn't translate to a team working on a project that takes longterm benefit from what the protocol has to offer. By creating more context & trust around who these builders are and what they can do - that grant money can be spent a lot more efficiently through Eden. The above 3 stakeholders provide us with a flywheel GTM strategy to build the Eden network. We dispurse protocol grant money more effectively in DAOs & Hackathons - attracting & incentivising builders to join the Eden network if they want to be considered for protocol grants. What is your solution & what alternatives are there available in the market already? *We've built a hybrid-AI system that indexes every project, person & collaboration across the network in a knowledge graph. We ensure "truthfulness" of data through blockchain-powered, skin-in-the-game mechanism design. This allows us to build a "pageRank for people" making people across any talent network more meaningfully searchable & matchable. Highly encourage you to watch our demo as well:
