# What next?

I’ve recently been really into the teachings of Michael Singer - on surrender & letting life unfold (which is in my control) rather than trying to make life unfold (which is not in my control). The teachings would tell me that I can say that good things are happening from that - because all suffering stems from preference/desire - according to the buddha’s teachings - which starts with like/dislike - but the truth is, good things have been unfolding. I’m dating this girl that I really like - don’t know if I love yet - but I like her a lot and I think I could love her. But I guess that’s the point right - letting life unfold is just letting the flow, flow & go with it.

# Eden

## Finish the thing

That brings me to where I’m at with Eden - it feels/looks like I’m going to need to make something happen relatively soon. And one of the thoughts I’ve been having there is finish things. Which means - you’ve done a build sprint, make it worth something by trying to sell it. It’s code AND distribution. So I did the building sprint - now I need to do the distribution sprint. If I can’t follow through on that shit - then I don’t have anything.

## Have clear quit criteria

Know - in measurable terms - when you end it. This means by day X I achieve Y - otherwise you keep doing what’s comfortable → building more etc. That’s easy. What’s hard is running head-first into the hard questions.

## Dealing with the fact that I did it wrong

I did not do much customer calls before I started building this - I did not do much customer calls period. I need to do more, I need to talk to a lot more people. I know this - why don’t I do it? Why do I believe that building this thing is going to change stuff. Or maybe I find someone like Florian who’s really good at that shit and just goes for it. Maybe that’s what life has been trying to tell me. Because if you think about it - I’m the one who’s steered us wrong. I’m the one who’s not been building that muscle, mostly because I have no idea who the heck I’m building for.

Fuck - just having a massive realization that the obstacle is the way and that part of my distribution goals should include having at least 20 calls with founder friends. This is why we write I guess.

# What’s Next

I’m trying to sense what some of the things are that I’d really like in 2025 - and this idea of deep partnerhsip is still very much there. I guess that can come in multiple forms - but it very much starts with me.

## I’m the problem (but luckily it’s clear)

I am horrible at asking for help and making space to receive it - I want to change this. Stronger, I need to change this if I’m ever going to become a better Entrepreneur. This is the main diff between me and Hendrik - he’s unafraid to ask for help. I am and I need to work on changing this asap - so every day, I’m going to make a call that scares the crap out of me where I’m asking people that I admire for help.
