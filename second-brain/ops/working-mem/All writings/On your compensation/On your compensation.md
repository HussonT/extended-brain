# The current status

The impact you’ve had on Eden is undeniable so far. We would not be where we are today without you & I hope you know how much I appreciate having you on this journey, through thick & thin + tolerant of the emotional rollercoaster that comes with this - the harsh reality of startups however is that we are not yet where we need to be & the market doesn’t care how much we work - if we’re not putting points on the board, it doesn’t matter.

I want to help you grow into the best version of yourself, for your but also for Eden’s sake & of course as you grow & become more valuable, so should your compensation as we’ve talked about.

So starting with the current status of your compensation & where I think we can both agree you are today. Today you are most certainly a senior full stack developer. The average pay for a senior full stack engineer in Spain is about [$60K](https://arc.net/l/quote/ngnljpsy).

Right now you are being paid $40 020 + $21 875 in stock options that vest each year which ads up to about a little over $60K/ year not taking into account that you are being granted stock options which of course hopefully will only go up in value.

# Here’s what I propose going forward

For each quarter we agree on 1 big milestone & a set of measurable habits that we want to develop together that will prove that you are more than a senior full stack engineer in this business starting next week. For each milestone that you reach, you unlock another 2500 shares & if we don’t miss any of the milestones for the next 4 quarters, you get a $10K cash bonus.

These milestones need to be fully within your control & SMART (that’s why the 300/community was a bad one because it wasn’t fully in your control). That would give you the chance to earn up to $80K/year in cash & equity together which is a 30% salary increase (average for companies is 5-10%)

Here’s an example of a milestone + habits (it’s basically like OKRs)

Milestone: The talent-intake with AI-interviewer, staked vouching mechanism & dashboard are live & usable in multiple communities with max 1 critical error/2 weeks.

Habits:

- At the end of each week, you write your own version of a weekly wrap up - writing about what you’re thinking when it comes to how the technology will meaningfully drive the business.
- We have a bi-weekly 1h 1:1 where you come prepared with questions to better understand the business & the direction we’re taking + come with suggestions of how the technology could better support those business goals.
- You miss only 1 of your promised delivery dates each month.

  

LMK what you think!
