Hi Sally,

Thanks so much again for your time, insights & amazing ideas yesterday.

It would really mean a ton if you could put me in touch with one or two hiring managers who are interested in finding innovative ways to source, assess & plug in the best-fitting talent into their teams.

  

Hereâ€™s a blurb you can send:

Eden is a startup that provides tools for hiring managers to take advantage of the mobile workforce on the internet. A fast and effective hiring process with great matching is essential to finding the right person for your project. Our focus is on using AI and Blockchain technologies to revolutionize hiring, but we need your help to ensure that our product meets your needs. Your insights and experience are essential to shaping our product into something that can make a real difference.

What's in it for you? We will share insights from other hiring managers on how they are using AI to get ahead, and you will have beta access to our tool as soon as our beta platform is available!

  

I appreciate you a lot, Sally!

Cheers,

Tom
