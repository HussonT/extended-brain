Here’s a scenario - it’s the year 2027, there are now fully mature AI-recruiters, -SDRs & everything in between. You wake up to 50 perfectly crafted e-mails that picked up on the same faint buying signal because you were brainstorming a problem with one of your ai-agents at work and you mentioned what could be the beginnings of a larger problem. They all seem to anticipate your future problems better than anything & work really hard to convince you that their solution is the one you need. The problem is: you don’t open any of them. Why not? Because you know that none of these AI-agents care. They don’t care if you get the job. They don’t care if you buy or not. They don’t care if you’re happy or unhappy with your decision.

  

What do raising, selling & hiring have in common? They are exercises in signal-detection.

When you’re hiring someone you’re trying to find signal on whether 1) you believe they can do the job 2) you’re going to like working with them - and I would even argue that 1 rolls up into 2, because who likes to work with incompetent people or even competent assholes?

When you’re buying, you’re looking for signal on whether 1) the solution will solve your problem better than anything else on the market 2) the company selling it to you isn’t going to screw you over
