    - High school
    - Horses vs cars
    - Company building has been a road to be closer to my daughter - got my O1 thanks to this
- We’re building the blockchain network that enables an ecosystem of AI-talent agents on the one side & AI-hiring agents on the other to figure out if a person is an ideal match for an opportunity, quickly.
- There are three main things you need to decentralise to build & grow such a network: incentives to produce, validate & then effectively search very rich & up-to-date talent & opportunity data

    - **Bake in aligned incentives:**
