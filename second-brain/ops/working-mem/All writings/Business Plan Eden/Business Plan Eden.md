# Executive Summary

Eden’s **purpose** is to unlock inspired teamwork in a freelance world workforce. Our **vision** is A world where everyone gets to find their people & love their work==. Our== ==**mission**== ==is to b==uild the world’s most effective talent coordination protocol & network.

Eden was founded in December 2022 as a C-corp. We raised an initial $500K pre-seed, have a first version of our product live & are onboarding the 10.000 talents that joined our waitlist in cohorts. The next months are intended to prove out our model and we are starting to line up conversations to raise a $3.2M seed round in September to help fuel + sustain our growth with the accompanying development needs.

## **What is Eden**

Eden Protocol is building the infrastructure to make finding the perfect freelancer for your project across the web near instant. As a first phase we’ve built talent management tooling for individual freelance collectives that help vet, manage & monetise their talent pools. Our next step is to build the tools that make it economically viable to share “talent liquidity” across collectives. That same tooling is being used to uncover talent in non-monetised communities such as on farcaster & in discords.

## Why does Eden exist

### Eden’s purpose

**Great, inspired work** is the single biggest societal progress lever we have.

Inspired, motivated A-player teams are at the root of everything that makes our daily lives better. Yet, today 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work & this while we spend 1/3 of our lives working.

The old way of working, where we tried to turn people into robotic “[organisation-men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Organization_Man)” with 40-year careers serving one org, has been fading over the last 70 years. Now, it's at a breaking point. Over 50% of the US workforce is projected to freelance by 2027. This contrast the “organisation men” to professionals with high degrees of freedom engaging in a diverse portfolio careers weaved across organisations. On the hiring side, this movement is being met by technology enabled companies who get a lot more done with drastically lower & lower headcount.

These trends together make it clear that the future of work consists of small, dedicated core-teams, supplemented by an on-demand, inspired "liquid workforce". This future requires effective, near-instant matching of talent to opportunities. Eden protocol is the global talent coordination protocol that makes such instant, inspired matches possible.

Having an instant-match made by your AI that feels like a referral from a smart friend you trust reduces the switching cost for both employer & employee to near-zero. Eden makes it easier than ever to find your people & love your work. Two pillars that will unlock the most globally inspired workforce in the history of the world, as they always have.

### Why we’re building Eden in the US, today

**Countering bias in AI for hiring**

The Rise of AI & LLMs has quickly brought a wave of new tools - including in the hiring sphere. Initially, chatGPT looked like a recruiters dream that could help with quickly analysing resume’s & formulating responses. However, it turns out that when you use a tool that is at its core a biased statistical model, you’re going to get biased answers. The bias is exactly what makes the AI model work. So using it for something that requires you to not have bias is like using a toothbrush to clean your toilet - it will get the job done, but sub-optimally. And at scale, that counts.

  

In her book, [Hilke Schellmann](https://www.amazon.com/Hilke-Schellmann/e/B0CR1X6D3L/ref=aufs_dp_fta_an_dsk), tries all the different AI-powered screening & vetting tools and essentially comes to the same conclusion as mentioned above. At Eden, we’re countering this by using blockchain enabled skin-in-the-game mechanisms such as [Vickery Clarck Groves games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_mechanism) to incentivise truth telling & achieve socially optimal solutions at scale. By combining the power of AI in it’s ability to quickly expand & collapse context and Blockchain in it’s ability to build decentralised verification mechanisms we’re making sure we’re using truthful human judgement where that is needed & AI where that’s most effective.

**As an alternative to over-reliance on big-platform lock-in through biases, destructive reviews & unfair-exclusions**

If you look at upwork’s customer support portal you’ll find many freelancers who had their means of making a living taken away from them and with it the reputation they’ve built up over many years. Upwork, Fiverr & all the other platforms have, due to their design, have every incentive to lock in freelancers and actively discourage multi-homing by making it very hard to transfer their “reputation” out of platform.

On the other hand - these platforms are incentivised to prioritise the needs of the clients over that of the freelancers, which means that disputes are often resolved in favour of the client, a lot of the times unjustly.

This means that freelancers get the short end of the stick as they can easily get punished without taking all the work they did to build up a reputation with them.

Eden changes this by building the network as a blockchain network rather than a corporate network. This allows users to fully own their profiles & by building an ecosystem of AI-hiring agents on top of this network, they can easily switch between agents if one is biased or not working out in their favour. Same goes for the client side. Agents will also build up a reputation, allowing for the “bad apples” to be effectively filtered out rather than getting killed by one bad review.

**Designed to be privacy preserving & bias-aware from the ground up**

Building Eden as a blockchain network means that people will own their own profile in the network, allowing many builders to use Eden as a peer-verified, rolodex optimised for use by any AI-hiring-agent. This will also allow companies to keep the “compute” internal, meaning that the matching will be able to be done a lot faster without needing to give up any of their data to a third party by using things like ZK tech etc.

It’s well known that internal recruiters are a lot more effective than external recruiters because internal recruiters know the internal company culture, have access to all internal company documents & can get feedback bot formally & informally. Linkedin & Upwork have released their own AI-agents, but that would be like having an external recruiter. This means that as a company you’d have to turn over all of your internal data to get good matching performance. Eden’s focus is on empowering anyone to build their own hiring agent in a bias-aware & privacy preserving way - both on the hiring side as a recruiter agent & on the talent side as a talent agent. This makes it possible for anyone who’s unhappy with the performance of their agent to, with the same profile, easily switch to another agent, or simply create their own that aligns with their preferences.

**Resolving the tension created by smaller companies who get more done with less with AI on the one side & the liquifying workforce on the other side**

The topology of companies has been changing towards small but mighty teams that can get a lot more done with a lot less. The old way of working, where we tried to turn people into robotic “[organisation-men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Organization_Man)” with 40-year careers serving one org, has been fading over the last 70 years. Now, it's at a breaking point. Over 50% of the US workforce is projected to freelance by 2027. This contrast the “organisation men” to professionals with high degrees of freedom engaging in a diverse portfolio careers weaved across organisations. On the hiring side, this movement is being met by technology enabled companies who get a lot more done with drastically lower & lower headcount.

These trends together are accelerating that topology of small, dedicated core-teams, supplemented by an on-demand, inspired "liquid workforce". This future requires effective, near-instant matching of talent to opportunities. Eden protocol is the global talent coordination protocol that makes such instant, inspired matches possible.

Having an instant-match made by your AI that feels like a referral from a smart friend you trust reduces the switching cost for both employer & employee to near-zero. Eden makes it easier than ever to find your people & love your work.

Today, there is no such solution - Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, Braintrust or any of the other freelance marketplaces are rarely used for “plug-in, mission critical work” because the match quality guarantee is too low + there are no strong enough accountability mechanisms. Until mission critical work can be outsourced to this liquid workforce, there is a big gaping hole that is becoming bigger and bigger that puts more pressure on these smaller teams and leaves more and more freelancers with non-mission critical work, that also is the first to be automated away by AI.

Eden fixes this by building in the accountability mechanism as well as the high quality matching guarantees through a ground up redesign of the talent matching network.

# Eden’s core products & services

We think of Eden as a product infrastructure company first & a product company second - similar to how apple focusses on delivering great hardware first upon which they provide critical services that make the difference for their ecosystem, starting with the developers that build on top of their infrastructure all the way to the end users and the guarantees they can make about a consistent user experience thanks to strategic choices around where to relinquish control over their infra versus where not.

## The Eden Infrastructure

At the core of Eden sit 3 infrastructural unlocks: 1. hyper-rich, dynamic talent profiles, 2. staked, weighted vouching incentives & mechanisms that enable decentralised talent profile validation & 3. dynamic vector embeddings enabled by RagGraphs that make it possible for different types of AI-agents to tap into the Eden network as if it were their personal rolodex.

## The Eden talent & opportunity network

### The talent network

The Eden talent network grows in 3 ways. Our talent-key mechanism incentivises:

1. Community managers of talent communities to vet, manage & monetise their talent with Eden.
2. Hiring managers to screen their candidates with Eden & let their recruitment process pay for itself.
3. Talented well-connected people to bring on their talented friends.

So far, we’ve created 10K hyper-rich, dynamic talent profiles in this manner.

### The opportunity network

Eden’s opportunity network also grows in 3 ways, made possible by Eden AI-hiring-agents who operate:

1. P**rivate/internal opportunity marketplaces** internal to an individual organisation with the ability to tap into the Eden network through zk mechanisms.
2. **Hybrid opportunity marketplaces**, opportunities shared between a set of complementary talent pools - for example a marketing dao shares specific opportunities with a development dao & vice versa.
3. **Our public opportunity marketplace** where anyone who wants their project staffed with the best people possible as quickly as possible can go to tap into the Eden network with the help of AI-agents.

## The Eden AI agent tooling as a gateway to our network

Similar to how Apple provides the xcode environment to its developers, so too do we provide a development environment for developers to build AI-hiring agents that can use the Eden standards + infrastructure to make it super easy for them to plug into the Eden network. This makes it possible for anybody to either build their own Eden enabled hiring-agent or integrate some of the core Eden services in their own applications.

# Eden’s go-to-market

The challenge for Eden is that there is a cold-start problem that needs to be solved. Why would talent go through the motions of building a deep talent profile & building up it’s reputation through various validation mechanisms if it won’t lead to meaningful work for them immediately? And vice-versa, why would any hiring manager post an opportunity to the network if there is no talent that fits their requirements on the platform?

Our answer to this problem is come for the tool, stay for the network. We set out to find an underserved niche that is set to grow exponentially that has both talent & opportunities already present. We found this in freelancer collectives & started building tooling to help decentralised freelance collectives in web3 to vet, staff & grow their talent pools. This is how, to this date, we have mapped out 10.000 talents and have currently 3 different talent collectives use our tooling. We are rolling out our staffing tools in collaboration with this collectives which helps us develop the best way to get the right people on the right projects - which is helping us bring in the other key aspect of our network: the opportunities.

## Target markets & segments

### SOM: Freelancers & freelance collectives in web3

This niche is in a way perfect to attack first because web3 is by nature a global industry that is very freelancer heavy. Being nascent & an industry that attracts a lot of scammers, having a tool that vets talent in a much deeper way upfront solves a huge pain for this collectives. Additionally, a lot of these collectives have the ambition to decentralise & run as a DAO for various reasons - but the reality is that often a couple of people seem to do many hours of work for little pay playing the talent coordinator across the network, which bottlenecks the effectiveness & growth of these talent collectives. If they are to grow into the big talent coordination networks they envision themselves to become, they will need tools like ours to help them get there.

This narrative in combination with the ability to tap into some of their most pressing, current pain points puts us in a good position to become a standard tool in the freelance collective stack.

### SAM: Freelancers & freelance collectives in tech

50% of the US workforce is projected to freelance by 2027. We believe & have seen anecdotal examples of this, that all those people that start freelancing want to still find the community they would find at their company & everything that comes with it like mentorship, friendship, etc. People will find that in freelance collectives that align with their values, interests & (skill)-aspirations. By positioning ourselves as a core of the freelance collective stack, we will move from focussing on web3 focussed freelance collectives to more broad tech focussed freelance collective stacks where the infra & design patterns we’re developing & refining in an early adopter environment, will be smoothed out & abstracted away towards more lagging adopters in the tech freelance space.

### TAM: The whole freelance market

The challenge we’re threading throughout this whole go-to-market is that cold-start problem. Once we have taken the niche of freelance collectives in tech, we will focus on launching freelance collectives where there aren’t (m)any yet + of course serve the ones that already exist.

We’ll launch these by vertical where, starting with freelancers that have broad-skillset applicability like for example designers in tech & then move down the specificity ladder making sure we’ll be able to service both sides of the market like for example - shoe designers in the fashion industry and keep launching vertical by vertical until we run & efficiently coordinate a significant portion of the US & global freelance market.

## Competition & positioning

We aren’t solving a new problem. Getting the right person on the right project for the right reasons is a problem as old as we’ve been a species known for its ability to collaborate. In essence, we are solving an old problem in a new way - which begs the question: how is this better?

At Eden, we’re enabling a new way of finding the perfect fitting talent for your project by focussing on two axis: match relevance & speed. We get you the best fit, fastest by combining the match relevance of a referral with the efficiency & search speed of AI-recruitment agents.

Highlighting a couple of competitors & our positioning against them.

![[/Untitled 27.png|Untitled 27.png]]

### Referrals

Referrals require a high upfront cost to build a network in the areas of competence that you require. They also have a local maximum - you’re going to find the best person in your network, not the globally best person for the project.

Eden builds the social capital skin-in-the game mechanisms that make a referral work into its network to scale referral level matching beyond local networks.

### AI-recruiter agents

Automating more Linkedin & Whatsapp messages isn’t the solution to finding the best talent, faster.

Eden re-imagines the whole professional network stack to end recruitment once & for all and usher in the era of AI-referrals where everyone talks to less, but more of the right people for the right reasons.

### Niche freelance platforms

Niche freelance platforms are incentivised to present you with the person that will maximise their margin as a platform, which isn’t always aligned with the best outcome for the person hiring or the freelancer.

By aligning the incentive around verifying the quality of the talent and not the referral itself, Eden aligns the incentives on all fronts. + If you’re not happy with the results of one search-agent, you can easily switch without losing everything you’ve built up - i.e. the lockin that you would have in a niche freelance platform.

### Staffing agencies

The staffing agencies are only as good as the tools & the personal networks they have. They are often also wildly expensive & do not have the incentive to find the best match for you - but the one that will make them the most money.

Eden’s different incentives structure + global network & incentive for talent to “own & invest” in their profile is huge.

## Financials

These are conservative predictions. And there are two parts to our model - the protocol/marketplace model & the SaaS model.

The Protocol level has a takerate for each successful transaction enabled by the protocol.

The SaaS model is our own flagship tooling on the back of which we’re building our protocol & network that we’re charging freelance talent collectives for.

### Protocol revenue (take-rate based part of the business model)

|**Protocol Revenue (takerate/ sucessful transaction)**|**average # succesful matches/\#month**|**Takerate %**|**average $ value of a succesful match**|**Total rev/month**|**Total average / year**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Year 1|10|10.00%|5000|$ 5,000.00|$ 60,000.00|
|Year 2|200|10.00%|5000|$ 100,000.00|$ 1,200,000.00|
|Year 3|1000|10.00%|5000|$ 500,000.00|$ 6,000,000.00|

### SaaS revenue (SaaS business model)

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Saas Subscription**|**# of subscribers**|**average value/subscription**|**MRR**|**ARR**|
|Year 1|20|250.00|$ 5,000.00|$ 60,000.00|
|Year 2|100|250.00|$ 25,000.00|$ 300,000.00|
|Year 3|400|250.00|$ 100,000.00|$ 1,200,000.00|

# Risks & opportunities

In this section we go a bit deeper on the different risks Eden faces & how we are mitigating those risks.

## Risks & mitigation strategies

### Technological

- Risk: Need for widespread adoption of agents in hiring
- Migation:
    - Our moat comes from the network & the incentive for talent to keep adding information to their profiles in that network to increase meaningful discoverability.
    - The data profiles we’re building up in our network will have value regardless of whether this becomes the future or not - the main difference will simply be how big the vision can be when we start getting used to & often using hiring agents to help us fill roles.
- Risk: Disruption from underlying foundational model builders like OpenAI
- Mitigation:
    - We’re designing with the assumption of the model becoming better and better & focussing on building a moat where by building for a very specific, verticalised niche use-case: hiring.
    - In short, we’re mitigating this by building our business around the fact that gets the underlying foundational models will get better.

### Market

- Risk: small, volatile risky market as a starting point (Web3 is a relatively small market at the moment)
- Mitigation:
    - We have design partners/clients that are web3 adjacent (for example agencies) that lead to ironing out copyable GTM strategies that will work outside of web3 & will help us attack new industries vertical by vertical.

### Operational

- Risk: Solo-founder/keyman risk
- Mitigation:
    - We have a written culture - we write most things out in longform memos that maximise context sharing
    - We’re actively looking to hire a CTO with co-founder ambitions who would get equal stake in the business.
- Risk: Cold start problem
- Mitigation:
    - We’re actively building distribution into our product and focussing on GTM strategies that help us crack that code like a “come for the tool, stay for the network” approach.
- Risk: High threshold for a useful profile / high onboarding/maintenance cost
- Mitigation:
    - Developing progressive profiling techniques

### Legal

- Risk: Token/security
- Mitigation:
    - We’re actively trying to stay away from using/building a token to make sure we’re only using one where it is super needed.
    - In any and all of the considerations around a potential token, we consult with lawyers that are very familiar with the matter.

## Opportunities

- Clear inflection points
- Companies are becoming smaller & smaller
- Importance of finding freelancers fast becomes even bigger
- Importance of getting the right person becomes greater
- 50% of us workforce projected to freelance
