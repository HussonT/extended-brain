## Introduction

### Purpose of the review

The purpose of this review is to clearly write out and reason through the performance of Miltos as a co-founder & CTO over the last year.

  

## Review of Past Performance

### Evaluation of performance over the past year

I believe you would be a great CTO at series-A or above at the helm of a bigger team but not at seed & pre-seed as I’ve found you are a relatively poor IC who needs to be recognised for most bits of work he does.

You’ve mentioned yourself multiple times that you’d like to have a team - but unfortunately we don’t have a team. I think your natural abilities to manage have & are hurting us as well as your relatively poor performance as an engineer

As CTO at pre-seed, seed you are mandated to set a technical direction & vision to drive effective discovery & iteration of the product.

As co-founder you are expected to drive the business forward from any angle possible.

For either instance I would argue that you have done neither & even actively did the opposite of this.

For each separately I’m going to enumerate instances that show you did not do this.
