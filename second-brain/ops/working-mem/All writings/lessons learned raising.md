3 lessons I learned raising money as first time venture backed founder with no prior network in VC that weren't obvious to me before I started

1. Depth > breadth

Before I started, I thought it was just a numbers game - "talk to as many investors as possible - you only need to find a couple that say yes." However, 80% of my most productive conversations with investors can be traced back to [**Ben Fielding**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) and [**Dermot O'Riordan**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), who have been advisors and mentors from before we even knew what we were going to build. Their introductions were worth 10,000 times any of the elevator pitches I did at networking events, as they were incredibly thoughtful about the intros and you could really feel that the belief in us was genuine in these intros. This allowed me to start the meeting from a place of credibility rather than having to be on the defensive and proving that we're even worth being talked to - which often led to more intros from the people I was introduced to.

2. Actively managing/hacking my mental state

I've compared raising to being in a toxic relationship with ten people at once, where you're anxiously waiting for replies and getting rejected with an "it's not you, it's me" text. I used to wake up and look at all my messages first thing in the morning. Whenever there would be a "we appreciated you - but" message, it would gut me and put me on the back foot for whatever meetings I had that day. That changed when I created specific rules and hacks to help me manage my mental state. For example, first thing in the morning, I went for a run, did some deep work, and only then started looking at these messages. I also had a happy music playlist that I would dance to hard between meetings whenever there was one that didn't go as smoothly as I'd hoped. Obviously, meditation is also huge. Before I started, I thought those things didn't matter, that it was all mindset, but those different little mental hacks make a huge difference.

3. Never be the one to tell yourself no

Initially, I was scared to annoy investors, which led me to shorten our pitch and hesitate to follow up. This mindset was hurting our chances, so I changed my mindset to "never be the one to tell yourself no." I started doing the full pitch no matter what and sending multiple follow-up emails until explicitly told no. This approach ensured I didn't sabotage potential partnerships due to a self-imposed story. Ofc want to nuance by saying I was always open & looking for feedback and generally tried to avoid being an asshole - but ensuring that I wasnâ€™t taking away the counterparty's explicit decision-making power.
