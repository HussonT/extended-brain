### Who are the main competitors / building something similar? How does Eden differentiate?

- 3 broad types of competitors (web3 focussed)
    - reputation/identity (indirect)
        - On the “person/identity” side, some notable tools are gateway, catapultlabs.xyz, mintkudos, incred, daolens, otterspace, talent protocol, talent layer and kleoverse - these projects share a common thread of wanting to become the “LinkedIn'' of web3 by focussing on identity or an aspect of identity.
        - Most of these projects are adding value on the signalling side of things, but not on the filtering/matching side of things. To achieve a great match, you need context about the opportunity. A 5-start engineer might be the best fit for a certain type of project but not for another. These projects do not take this into account and therefore only solve a tiny bit of the staffing problem.
        - Eden, by focussing on the talent match, interprets these reputational-identity tokens - both Eden native ones as well as others - in the context of an opportunity. In essence, we’re building the google on top of all the reputational projects that are out there and aggregate them for you at the moment that you need those the most: namely the moment that you’re making decisions to staff a project - impossible to achieve for these tools without building out a whole “project” side. They’re building the webpages, we’re building google.
    - Project/opportunity (indirect)
        - Project (management) tools, like dework & wonderverse, charmverse emphasize decentralized project management, leaving discovery and talent matching as afterthoughts despite having the right person on the right project being the main factor for success in building the project.
        - Eden, by focussing on the match can get you to where you want to be, faster. Instead of just creating the infrastructure that creates visibility around what needs to happen and incentives work by putting a bounty up for the work - Eden’s AI can go one step further and helps you find the best suited people in the network to fulfil the task at the moment that you’re creating the task - impossible to achieve for these project tools without also building out a whole “person” side. They’re building the webpages, we’re building google.
    - Decentralised Recruitment (direct)
        - Then you have projects like Braintrust, jobprotocol, techtree & pallet. They are operating from the same insight that the best talent match out there is a referral, however they are taking a skeuomorphic approach to solving the talent matching problem by incentivising the network to fill a role by putting a bounty/rev share on the open role. This doesn’t solve the fundamental incentive misalignment that comes from using a middle man in the talent match: game theoretically speaking, a middle man will always optimise for the easiest to get, good enough candidate to get the bounty - which is rarely the optimal candidate.
        - We’re taking a non-skeuomorphic approach by designing the network in a way that it rewards the scaling of context & trust in the network, enabled by AI & blockchain. Context & trust are the two things that make a referral great and by scaling them in the network, we can remove the middle man altogether by replacing it with what the network + AI recommends - this makes the talent match faster, fairer & better.

### Can you confirm the [if I remember correctly] 7 DAOs that are committed to participating in the beta & some relevant information about them, ie how you see them fitting into the protocol with contributor hours, style of tasks etc?

- 5 DAOs, 3 Hackathons, 3 Protocols & 2 partnering projects.
- GTM is mainly focussed on enabling a flywheel between DAOs, Hackathons & Protocols
    
    ![[/Untitled 30.png|Untitled 30.png]]
    
- DAOs: Developer DAO, Bankless DAO, Valley DAO, ICON DAO & then in talks with a couple others like SUPER DAO, … (all with no outreach from our part)
    - Developer DAO
        - We currently have our alpha live here:
            - Mainly focussed on product, backend, frontend, design & blockchain opportunities
            - Average contributor that joins DD is a dev with 10-15 hours a week to spend working on side-projects that could turn into more
    - Bankless DAO
        - Initial focus is on Bankless Consulting
            - They would use us to staff projects with people from across the DAO
            - currently only associates get staffed and its a pretty lengthy process to become an associate - a lot of potential talent underutilised
            - Classic consultancy type projects - ranging from a month - 3 months work in marketing, strategy & more classical consulting type things.
    - Valley DAO
        - Want to use our tool to do internal matching around complementarity of skills & have a tool that decentralises the talent coordination
        - We’re a perfect fit for their needs
        - Mainly focussed on projects around synthetic biology - project range from doing research together to work that actually ends up being done in a lab
    - ICON DAO
        - A DAO of ICON blockchain contributors
        - Really need a way to decentralise their talent coordination to bring together contributors around projects coming up.
- 3 Hackathons
    - ETH Denver EF foundation organised Sub hackahton
        - One of the core members of D_D is also a core member at EF foundation
        - They want to use Eden for their team matching - ideal use-case for us
    - Lightshift Hackathon
        - A VC that organises a lot of hackathons
        - Want to find a way to meaningfully engage the talent base that they build up throughout these hackahthons for their portfolio companies
    - ETH Chicago
        - One of our investors is working on making ETH chicago happen
        - We would be the tool of choice to facilitate that hackathon
- 3 Protocols
    - All 3 protocols are interested to distribute grants in Developer DAO through Eden as we provide them with visibility & credibility around who’s applying to their grant
        - Metis
        - Push
        - Polkadot

### Who is in the warm network lined up for a broader participation?

In web3

- Partnerships w Orange DAO, Seedclub, Origami, guildxyz & Catapult are being talked about. This would ensure broad distribution to many DAOs instantly.
- We’re already talking to the ETH Foundation with whom we have a testcase for a hackathon already.
- Cardano wants to use us for their catalyst program
- We haven’t done active outreach yet DAOs are finding us

Outside of web3

- Singularity net’s Deepfund wants to use us for their community
- We have contacts in goldman sachs who have tried solving this problem w AI before (my co-founder used to work on this)
- One of our investors has a lot of web2 investements who would use us as an internal HR tool that links to the broader Eden network to fill “public” tasks

### Do you have a financial model for the next year?

2 main revenue streams for the next year:

- Application layer: Premium features for DAOs & Hackathons
- Protocol Take-rate on every transaction enabled

# Application Layer Revenue (1y Projections)

## Revenue

**The Eden DAO app - classic freemium SaaS business model**

By the end of 2023, we aim to serve 50 DAOs with an average DAO size of 2500 members, we aim to activate 20% of them in Eden = 25.000 members using Eden - we aim to activate 10% of them as power users (Linkedin has 39% of users as power users)

  

#### Eden DAO app: Business Model

|User Group|Number of Users|Subscription|Total MRR|
|---|---|---|---|
|[[My writings/All writings/TA ventures Questions/Eden DAO app Business Model/Power Users\|Power Users]]|2500|$50.00|125000|

  
  

  

**The Eden Hackathon app - classic freemium SaaS business model**

Devpost hosts 7500 hackathons and charges 1500/month. We’re convinced that the number of hackathons is only going to grow as everything that was a platform is now becoming a protocol and invites builders to build on top of their tools. Hackathons are a great way to incentivise that building. We add the benefit for these hackahtons to monetise & engage the talent base they succeed in attracting - which incentives them to keep paying for our tool.

As our initial tool is a bot that helps turn discord into a hackathon platform, we would be charging less - but believe we would attract a bigger portion of the market. We would price at 500. The first year, we believe we can sign on 50 hackathon organisers by the end of 2023

# Protocol Layer Revenue (1Y Projections)

By 2023, there are 2 types of transactions we will focus on to enable through the protocol:

- Microgrants from other protocols
    - We aim to onboard 20 protocols for a total monthly disbursement of 50 grants with an average value of 5k. We take a 10% service fee on top of these grants.
- Freelance hiring across the Eden network
    - We estimate that, for the first year, the numbers of freelancers & polyworkers doing at least 10h/week of paid work through the Eden network will be around 10% of the total network. An additional 15% will do an average of 10h/month. 5% will find fulltime work through the Eden network.
    - We’ve calculated at the average payment calculated on upwork - which is 21$/h. This is likely to be higher for us as we’ll focus on more high paying jobs such as blockchain devs - so you can deem these estimations as conservative.
    - 50.000 people on the Eden network by the end of 2023 is our target.

### Could you expand more on the protocol revenue model and token economics? Interested to learn the concrete specifics about monetization, reputation staking rewards etc & how it all works. Also, when is this going to be implemented? When might we see the protocol and participants generating revenue?

### Hiring plans / needs (saw some info in the notion page could you expand a little bit?)

The above described flywheel can be enabled with two slight variations of our app-codebase (one for DAOs & 1 for hackathons) & a v1 of our matching engine.

To facilitate that at speed we need to make 3 additional hires & hire 1 part time contractor.

- The 2 senior devs that are already leading our team of contributors waxy & eloi - that way we’ll better be able to serve our team of contributors
- 1 partnerships, events & outreach lead - this person will also help to better serve our team of contributors
- Contractor: 1 UX/UI person - this person will help with the look & feel of the entire app

### How are you sizing the web3 market, any research to share? & do you see a need to go beyond web3 native contributors / DAOs?

We aim to build on web3, not just in web3.

That being said, the number of governance token holders is still growing steadily throughout the bear, currently sitting at 5.1m [https://deepdao.io/organizations](https://deepdao.io/organizations) - we believe DAOs will grow & want to be in that market but we’re not banking on DAOs as our TAM. That being said, it’s still a very interesting opportunity, even today already. Say we’re able to capture 20% of the market today - that would be 1,02m users. Plug the business model we described above in and you can estimate an aggregated MRR of roughly $20m.

We believe one of the reasons DAOs are growing is the same reason the predominant employment form in the US is becoming freelancing: people want more work agency as in control over when, where, how & why they work.

The growing freelance market is going to require better, more & faster talent matching. Eden will be the network that can provide the fastest & most accurate talent match on the market which has implications far beyond web3 - from staffing (which is a $650 billion market) to general HR & recruitment (which is $720 billion market).

### could you also pls outline the differences between this and a more typical web 2 model, I assume it’s about the AI accelerated talent matching & incentivizing reputation givers to back the right contributors?

Current solutions result in 85% of people being emotionally disengaged at work & an average of 41 days to fill a role. It’s fair to say that current solutions aren’t very good at getting the right person on the right project for the right reasons. That’s because your main options are:

1. Overwhelming job-boards
    1. You have an incentive problem here: your best strategy on job boards is quantity, not quality. Apply to as many things as you can - this is bad for both sides as a lot of the applications become noise.
    2. Eden solves this by using skin-in-the-game mechanics that prioritise quality over quanity in the network
2. Dodgy marketplaces
    1. If you’re looking for a ML engineer on upwork, you’ll get a list of people with a 5-star rating to go off of. That 5 star rating only says - “this person is not horrible”. When’s the last time you hired a 2-star engineer? An extra problem with that signal is that it completely disregards context - not every engineer is the 5-star engineer for my project. The one with affinity for marketing, experience with startups & profound insights in the chemical industry is.
    2. On top of that, there is the [job signaling problem](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1882010): You have every incentive to overconfidently state your abilities as this is a one-shot job.
    3. Eden uses AI to maximally understand the context of each match - both on the project as well as the person side. The blockchain enabled skin-in-the-game mechanics solve the truthfulness & job-market-signaling problem by having the network explicitly state its level of confidence in you.
3. Recruiters & staffing agencies
    1. Problem with recruiters is game theoretical: there’s a fundamental incentive misalignment that comes from using a middle man in the talent match: game theoretically speaking, a middle man will always optimise for the easiest to get, good enough candidate to get the bounty - which is rarely the optimal candidate.
    2. Eden solves that by taking the middle man out of the equation all together. The only way to be rewarded is to perform actions that increase context & trust around a person - which removes the need for a middle man without removing those things that make the middle man connection great: context & trust.
