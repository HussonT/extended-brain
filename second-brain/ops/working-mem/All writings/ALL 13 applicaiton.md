What is the problem that you’re solving?*

Summarize in 1 to 2 paragraphs the exact problem your product aims to solve.

  

AI is biased and flawed at validating/assessing talent. If Upwork's new AI-bot does not like your profile and doesn't surface it for projects you would be amazingly well suited for, there's nothing you can do. This is fuel to the fire of the already well-known problem of Upwork is very hard to trust for anything that is not mission critical work on the hiring manager side & that there are many cases of freelancers getting kicked & losing all the time & effort they put into building their profiles. As more than 50% of the workforce is projected to freelance by 2027, this will become more & more of a problem.

  

The meta problem we’re solving is structurally cutting out the middle men that are recruiters, starting in web3. The way we envision doing that is by building an AI that can refer talent as if they’re your friend. The key problem to solve to make that possible is AI’s are horrible at judging people, which is generally a big problem in AI-powered HR-applications.

AI’s are bad at judging people which makes it hard to trust their judgement for decisions as important as hiring. We’ve all heard the horror stories of biased AI’s & it’s not for nothing that in most regulatory framework HR-AI is categorised as highest risk. If you consider what AI is: advanced statistical models, you understand the bias is the feature & not the bug. So just like using a toothbrush to clean your toilet is a sub-optimal tool to get the task done, so too is only using AI to judge the credibility & ability of talent in the context of hiring. As long as we don’t solve giving AI’s a way to understand talent credibility, we’re always going to need recruiters & we don’t think empowering recruiters or hiring managers to send more messages with LLMs is the solution.

Summarise in 1 to 2 paragraphs the exact solution that you’re building to solve the problem you’ve identified.

  

Reimagining corporate talent networks as a blockchain talent network that cracks decentralised talent validation removes through weighted, staked vouching removes the key limiting factors to building a truly global talent coordination protocol that optimizes for the right person on the right project for the right reasons.

  

We’re building the infrastructure needed for AI-agents to refer talent better than humans ever could. When we build the infrastructure that makes it possible for an AI-agent to do that, we’ll do to recruitment agencies what [booking.com](http://booking.com) did to travel agencies. You need two things for a great referral: lots of context & an understanding of credibility. On the one hand we create a digital context network specialised for use by AI-agents by storing lots of high-signal, broad context “memories” about talent & opportunities in our knowledge-graph. Those “context-memories” come from processing resumes, online-presence data (github, stackoverflow, linkedin) & LLM-powered interviews with talent, peers & hiring managers. On the other hand we build a useful notion of talent & opportunity credibility through our on-chain vouching network. This allows us to a page-rank type mechanism powered by human-judgement for those context-memories. We calculate matches by mapping all the context memories onto a hiring manager’s score topics for relevance.

  

The first use-case we’ve built is an intelligent web3 community job-board since we can tap into a pool of early adopters to iterate & evolve the tools we’re building. Full-time jobs are just the start, our vision be able to build the protocol that can effectively plug-in the right talent, anywhere: from classic job-boards to being able to find & engage the best matching freelancer on the web in no time.

  

The v1 of the AI agent that uses our on our own infra has been running Developer-DAO’s job board for a month & 2 weeks. She has interviewed her first 300 members & made the first $1k revenue. For each interview we produce 100+ data points that are used in our vetting & matching algorithms. We’re launching our on-chain, key-based vouching mechanism in the next months that makes it possible for community members to earn by staking their reputation on each-other and is data that is crucial to make vetting & matching algorithms effective.

  

On average, the best talent matches come from referrals. However, referrals are notoriously hard to scale, so we asked the next question: what makes referrals great & can we scale that in a network? High-context & staked-credibility are what make referrals work and AI & Blockchain are respectively great context & credibility scalars - it is on top of this thesis that we our building our on-chain hiring network for AI-agents. In future, we’ll have built the network that governs & aggregates the primitives that AI-agents use to compute effective talent & opportunity matches beyond what we deem humanly possible today.

  

Our starting point is to fix the talent sourcing problem in web3 specifically, as the problem is most acute here + it will be easier to cross the on-chain chasm starting in the web3 space with the kind of tools we’re building. Traditional talent acquisition channels like LinkedIn or big job-boards are ineffective due to the pseudonymous culture, the default-global - & the relatively nascent nature of the space. There are only 20K active web3 devs according to github activity and it’s not always clear if who you’re talking to are who they say they are. Add to that that the best people are never looking and the result is that it often gets very hard & expensive to find & attract the best fitting talent, quickly in web3.

After high-school, I travelled for 2 years. The outcome of that early vision quest was that I’d come up with 3 life-goals: one of them was impact a billion+ lives through foundership & technology. While on the road in late 2015, an idea for a geo-location-based skill-finding app called TMWRK led me to write my first business plan - a 200-page monstrosity for which I flew home to drop on a befriended investor’s desk. He understandably laughed me out of the room, which drove me, despite having no money to speak of, to assemble a team of 4 people to build the app with me. Frustrated by my inability to build and drive the project forward, faster - I decided to study computer science at KU Leuven in 2015. There, I fell in love with the potential, society-wide impact of paradigm-shifting technologies like AI & blockchain. Even though that first app failed, I kept launching business ideas throughout the course of my studies. The most notable of those attempts was perspektiv.ai, a talent-matching platform that used AI to match students to internships.

In 2019 I dropped out of my CS master’s program to pursue what culminated in a 10-person digital innovation consultancy, called [www.humain.ai](http://www.humain.ai/). We helped clients such as the EU institutions, major-multinationals & BEL20 companies figure out how to use AI to get the right person in the right place for the right reasons - I worked on projects like predicting employee churn & anticipating future hiring needs based on market trends. I sold the agency after realising that scaling an agency was not the way for me to achieve my life’s goal. Since getting involved with blockchain and web3 in 2017 (I launched a campus-wide impact coin on top of my own blockchain that helped my uni save on its heating bill), I’ve seen the impact, innovations and potential of the space grow; it was an easy decision to jump headlong what has now become Eden Protocol. At Entrepreneur First ([www.joinef.com](http://www.joinef.com/)), an incubator/accelerator in London, I met my co-founder.

Eight years ago, I wanted to make a device to help blind people read books. But the technology I needed wasn't ready yet. I needed advanced image optimised neural nets and good camera technology. Instead of starting from scratch, I hacked spy glasses that I found online.

I connected these glasses to my Raspberry Pi, which I had set up with my models in MATLAB. This work was difficult because I was mainly figuring it out as I went, there were no tutorials or specialised libraries at the time. I learned that with the right mindset and tools, you can change anything to fit your needs. And, I realized that I had the skills to do this kind of work.

In the end, I made a device that could read books to blind people. I knew I had done a good job when I got to show my device at the Global Humanitarian Technology Conference in Seattle. This made me proud of my work.

Tom- Describe your biggest failure or the most difficult time in your life. How did you recover and what did you learn from it? (1st Founder)*Here we're trying to understand whether you have a particular motivation to achieve extreme success, something to prove to the world or a chip on your shoulder.

At 19, I got a call from a woman that I had a one night stand with informing me that I was going to be a dad. She’s 10 years older living in Tucson, AZ with a life where a little kiddo would fit perfectly. I was back in Belgium, starting my CS studies after travelling the world for 2 years and living a life where I the closest horizon that I could see kids, was in 15 years. I was terrified of what everyone would think: I went from being the high-school council president to being the guy with the kid at 19. For the months leading up to her birth, I wallowed in shame & became suicidal.

My suicidal thoughts came to a point where I asked myself: “Are you in or are you out? But if you’re out, end it tonight. If you’re in - then be f*cking in.” I decided to be in. The next morning I started looking for books, youtube videos, whatever I could find to help myself get out of this. That led me down a rabbit hole of self-development & turned growth into one of my single biggest core-values. It thought me that you can grow yourself out of any challenging situation - and I’m now on company no. 4 with one of my companies acquired in 2021.

Despite being in Tucson a month each year for her birthday, calling every weekend and very aware & involved in her life that way as well as never having missed a child support payment while having had times where I personally struggled to pay rent, the on-paper choice I’m making, is building companies over being a physically present dad. I can’t let that choice be in vain. There is no way I can look my daughter in the eye and say “I wasn’t there because I tried to become a founder of a generation defining company”. I’m way past trying - I’m doing.

(1st Founder)*Here we're trying to understand whether you have a particular motivation to achieve extreme success, something to prove to the world or a chip on your shoulder.

The most difficult phase of my life was coming back from really bad academic performance in high school. At 15, I was about to be held back. That was a horrible moment socially & emotionally. So I flipped a switch, I decided I would go to the best university in Greece, just to prove everyone wrong. So long story short, for my last two years in school, I had to go from the bottom 20% of students to the top 1% in order to go to one of the most difficult universities in Greece. I studied non-stop, catching up on everything that I missed those school years & then some. I passed with flying colors in the top 0.6% of students and getting into the university of my dreams with electrical and computer engineering.

  

When and how did the founders meet? Have you worked together in the past?Skip this question if you're a solo founder.

We met in the incubation program of Entrepreneur First (www.joinef.com), a global VC with a 10b dollar portfolio and a talent investing thesis that brings together high-potential individuals to co-found companies with notable web3 companies Aztec, Vaults & Gensyn having their roots there.

We hit it off on our very first call, 4 weeks before the official start of the EF program. Our thinking is highly complementary - Tom is more conceptual, Miltos very quickly makes those concepts concrete. Entrepreneur First actively stress tests the relationship - and a year and a half later we’re still going. Since then we’ve lived together in 3 different countries together and currently we live together in Chattanooga, Tennessee in a pre-seed/seed founder residency called brickyard (www.justlaybrick.com).

What binds us more than anything is a deeply shared commitment to growth & contribution + our ability we share to have highly difficult & emotional conversations in a very productive way.

  

**When did you start working on this idea and why did you choose it?***

The current product iteration - 3 months. This is product iteration #4, we’ve been building together since march 2022.

The reason we choose this is because we have an insight that we’re in a unique position to execute on: AI’s are horrible at “judging” people, (prediction) markets are better & the only way to move past the current recruitment-process paradigm is to build an AI who’s judgement you can trust - which requires both a deep understanding of AI & Blockchain networks. You also need a crypto-native community in which you can iterate quickly - and as one of the flagship teams building in Developer DAO, we’ve got all the above.

  

What is your unfair advantage in solving this problem?*Explain why your founding team is uniquely positioned to solve this problem over an equally qualified team (e.g., distribution advantages, domain expertise, or any advantage that would be almost impossible for another team to replicate).

We have been launching products & experiments in Developer DAO since April 2022. As a community of 5000+ active web3 devs with a reach of 100.000+ web3 interested people in its orbit, it is the perfect place for us to spin up our on-chain hiring-network for AI-agents as we get to iterate quickly with a lot of user feedback & an engaged community behind us - crucial for building effective networks, and especially the ones that require on-chain behaviour.

  

**What other companies are solving this problem today or could if they wanted to? Why will you succeed against them?***

When GPT-3 came out, there are so many “AI-recruitment” agents that popped up. Some note-able ones are moonbeam, popp.ai, hollyhires - from the founders of job protocol, who sunsetted their hiring-bounty protocol to pursue hollyhires. What they all seem to miss is that AI is horrible at making “judgements”. We’ve all heard the horror stories of biased AI’s. If you consider what AI’s are: basically advanced statistical models, you understand the bias is the feature & not the bug. So just like using a toothbrush to clean your toilet is a sub-optimal tool to get the task done, so too is using AI to judge the credibility & ability of talent - even and maybe especially with LLMs because they sound confident. You are, however not solving that first principle judgement problem.

Markets in the limit are a lot better at “judging” talent & determining the value of skills & abilities. Both at the macro & micro level with the local-prediction market being the team making the hiring decision. Blockchains make it possible to design skin-in-the-game mechanisms that embed these market dynamics in the network & can robustly scale the notion of talent-value across the network, way better than AI ever could.

What’s your current traction?*Share usage metrics (e.g. WAU) and growth stats. Note that it’s perfectly reasonable to have low numbers or not even have launched yet – that’s often the case for most accepted startups.

The beta version of the job-board that our our AI runs for online communities, has been live for a month and a half in Developer DAO. Since launch, we had over 4000 job-board hits & our first 300 community members do AI-interviews with an average session being 11 minute up to 37 min. This shows how engaging the interview is + the depth of info we’re able to capture: we capture over 100 relevant data points per interview. We generated our first 1000$ in revenue for the DAO. In the next 6 months, we’re racing to grow our AI-interviewed talent network to 5.000 so we can launch a subscription product, think LinkedIn recruiter for web3 built on top of web3-communities & built to skip recruiters to cater directly to hiring managers by being a lot more precise in its ability to target & match relevant people & jobs.

We’re also making good progress to launch a network-native business model with our multi-player, key-powered vouching mechanism. In essence, whoever holds a key of a talent that ends up getting hired through Eden gets a piece of their hiring bounty. When communities hold the keys of all their community members in a multi-sig, that multi-sig gets paid each time anyone from the community gets hired. This incentivises community-leadership/influencers to advertise relevant opportunities from the Eden network to their own talent base/community + make becoming part of the Eden network part of their community onboarding flow. That way we can build the most effective hiring network the internet has ever seen, together.

What unique insights do you have about your users?*Share insights or findings you’ve learned about your target users that might be interesting or unexpected.

1. It is very hard for people without the right logos or keywords on their CV to make it past the screening & internal recruiters at for example WalletConnect hate that that’s how they’re filtering out people, but when they have 6000 applicants there currently is no other way - the only way passed the keywords is if they spend time building personal relationships with the recruiters on conferences or other.
2. Key-word filtering is a feature for recruiters but a bug for hiring managers because the incentives aren’t fully aligned. Hiring managers want the best match, recruiters want a good enough match that will get them their placement reward. The game theoretical dominant strategy for recruiters is volume which rarely leads to the best match.
3. Referrals are much more likely to yield a high quality match because of a high context bandwidth & staked reputation. It’s essentially a situation in which the information asymmetry reduction between candidate & hiring mangers is “pre-paid” & transfers in line with the amount of trust that exists within the referral.
4. AI & Blockchain reduce the information asymmetry between hiring manager & talent massively by scaling context bandwidth & enabling staked reputation at scale. That’s why an AI & Blockchain powered network will do to recruitment agencies what [booking.com](http://booking.com) did to travel agencies.
5. The j2bd for recruiters, in sine quae non order of importance
    1. get the right distribution (the talent pipe needs to be filled at all times, ideally with talent that is likely to come out “good enough” on the other side)
    2. fit into current workflow (because it’s a numbers game, there is little benefit for recruiters to switch away from tools that aren’t optimised to drive/deal with volume)
    3. weed out the worst-fitting candidates (not needing to find the best match is why key-word bingo works for recruiters + makes it that logos are great downside protection. A recruiter will rarely be frowned upon for presenting an ex-googler)
    4. present talent that is good enough (which is at the root of the cause of hiring being a “numbers game” and not a “quality matching game”)
6. The j2bd for hiring managers, in sine quae non order of importance
    1. Give me the 5 top candidates that I can interview (hiring managers do not have time to source or vet talent - not exactly a unique insight but very true)
    2. Give insight into how you made the selection (If hiring managers trust your selection method, they will trust your selection - this is where a lot of AI tools are inadequate because they fail to effectively judge talent)
    3. Show me how they reasonably fit our requirements (If they don’t fit the requirement & there’s a good reason or counter argument, they will be considered.)
    4. Show me how likely they are to exceed expectations (what’s the asymmetric upside potential of this candidate?)
7. AI’s are horrible at “judging” people, (prediction) markets are better.
    1. We’ve all heard the horror stories of biased AI’s. If you consider what AI’s are: basically advanced statistical models, you understand the bias is the feature & not the bug. So just like using a toothbrush to clean your toilet is a sub-optimal tool to get the task done, so too is using AI to judge the credibility & ability of talent.
    2. What has historically been pretty good at “judging” talent & determining the value of skills & abilities is the market in combination with the local-prediction market that is the team making the hiring decision. Blockchains make it possible to design skin-in-the-game mechanisms that embed these market dynamics in the network & can create a way better notion of talent-value than AI ever could at network scale (rather than remain local).
8. On chain = opportunity to design better hiring game / Show me the incentives & I’ll show you the outcome
    1. The current dominant strategy in the hiring game is volume (or spam in internet terms). (Bad) recruiters are not incentivised to find the best match rather to find the match that will stay in the role long enough for them to get paid - which means that it’s often a better strategy to throw as much at the wall and see what sticks rather than really do the work to figure out if the match is there. Look at LinkedIn & the amount of messages you get & despite the limitations that LinkedIn puts up it still pays to send out as many messages as possible - that’s because the game theoretical dominant strategy is spam, that’s a fundamental network design flaw.
    2. Blockchains offer the opportunity to design networks in which the dominant strategy is not spam. Our vouching mechanism for example is designed to make the dominant strategy producing & verifying relevant information that leads to a hire for each-other. Producing that kind of information in a verifiable way backed by skin-in-the-game mechanisms is only possible thanks to blockchains.
9. Blockchains allow for a higher signal/noise ratio by making information more cheaply verifiable
    1. The dominant strategy of spam with now AI writing & optimising resume & cover letters make the current application landscape very noisy & signal poor: companies try to get as many applicants as possible & then filter on relatively poor proxies of whether talent would be a good fit such as key-words etc, which means that talent applies to as much jobs as possible, which still makes it very expensive to reduce the information asymmetry between talent & hiring manager effectively (i.e. 7 round interviews etc)
    2. Instead of paying different recruiters ungodly amounts to verify the same information about talent, you could more efficiently use resources by recording the information and its verifications (like vouches, reference checks and collaboration reviews) & reward the people that have recorded them for doing so - which would still be a fraction for infinitely better information. You can also design mechanisms that price in the dynamic, inflationary nature of credibility and the value of skills in the market through mechanisms such as talent prediction markets. These are mechanisms that were not pragmatically implementable without blockchains.

What's your distribution strategy?*How do you plan to get users for your product?

Our objective is to build out our own network optimised for our AI to do referral level matching from - that means we have a goal to interview 5000 talents in the next 4 months with our LLM. We’re currently pursuing two parallel distribution strategies for this:

1. Tap into the targeted distribution that communities & influencers offer.
2. Tap into the “high-pull” that well known brands in the space have by solving the key-word pain that internal recruiters have.

  

  

How big could your product become?*Give us a sense of how large the opportunity is and how your startup captures value. We understand this is an imperfect assessment at this stage – our goal here is to understand your thinking process.
