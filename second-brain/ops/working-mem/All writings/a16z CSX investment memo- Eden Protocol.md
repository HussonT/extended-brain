Team,

As we continue to do our part in building the next internet by backing the projects that will shape it, we’re thrilled to announce Eden Protocol as one of the projects we’re backing for our CSX 24 New York Cohort.

Eden’s vision is to enable a world where everyone finds work they love with people they like. To make this vision a reality the Eden team is building the blockchain network that facilitates AI-enabled hiring agents to match talent & opportunities with orders of magnitude more efficacy than the agents that are currently being built ontop of existing corporate networks. The main reason for this is Eden’s way to incentivise relevant data availability + data credibility and the way the data is processed & stored, baked into Eden’s network design.

For their GTM they’ve deployed their own AI-agent to help web3 communities vet, onboard & manage their talent base. Communities monetise their talent by making the hidden talent in web3 communities accessible - which is something that benefits all of the a16z crypto portfolio companies.

All-in-all Eden is clearly a fresh, non-skeuomorphic take rooted in the paradigm of the next internet that we all seek to enable here at a16z crypto. Eden’s founder is a first-principle technical-thinker with a clear vision for what needs to be built & why and an ability to inspire, sell & execute.
