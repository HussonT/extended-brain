# intro

We’ve got one life and yet 85% of people spend their days emotionally disengaged at work, dragging themselves through the day. To us, that’s unacceptable. We **believe the biggest risk in life is not living up to your full potential. Not developing a passion for what you do. Not living life on** **your** **terms & not making work, work for you - whatever that might mean.**

It’s hard to grasp what the world is potentially missing out on. **Would we have cured cancer, solved climate change or world hunger if we’d empowered everyone to be the right person on the right project for the right reasons?**

When Miltos & I first met on a call in march of 2022 - we quickly understood we were a match made in heaven. Jointly we decided: “**it’s time to build big”**. It’s time to make work, work for all of us. We see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a paradigm-shifting organisation that builds those kind of life-changing products driven by **social** (the great resignation, quiet quitting, a growing freelance market), **technological** (mature AI, Blockchain, …) & **regulatory** (crypto regulations, rails for mass adoption,…) **inflection points**.

This doc is meant to outline our vision 3 years out, so we might align & hit it in the bullseye - knowing what the bullseye looks like. So let’s grab that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity by the horns. All bull-puns intended.

## what is a vivid vision?

A vivid vision is the 4-6 page vivid description of what Eden will look, feel & act like in three years. It’s the cathedral sketch of what we’ll have accomplished by then. It’s written in the present tense as if already happened. It’s a way to pull the future into the present. A three year horizon is chosen as this is close enough to feel actionable yet far enough to make sure we’re aiming big & have room to build, measure, learn & adapt. Important therefore is to make the distinction that this documents only describes the why & what and speaks to none of the how. The how is what everyone that has anything to do with the Eden story described in this document - contributors, investors, friends, family, clients, coaches, partners, suppliers, government officials, competitors, … - will help to figure out over the course of these next three years. With that, let’s dive in.

## What’s our impact?

> [!important] **From the shuffle to the purpose economy.**

It is January 1st, 2026, the average time it takes to fill a position through Eden is a mere couple of hours. Our core bet - leveraging AI, Blockchain and Community to create a talent search protocol that feels like a friend recommending you talent and/or opportunities has paid off big time. Eden is the go-to way for people to find meaningful work & join teams that make them feel like they belong. Our focus on autonomy, mastery and purpose has struck a chord with people and created a strong desire to join the Eden network as a way of pursuing all 3. Eden is providing a new 21st century skill & self-development centric career path - away from organisation & role centric career paths.

### Eden pioneered a new workforce model: the purpose driven, liquid workforce.

Our ability to match people granularly to projects (instead of to roles) is a game changer for the way companies attract, engage & retain talent.

1. **Attract**  
      
    Eden puts a huge liquid workforce at the fingertips of **c**ompany- & project-leads by allowing for a trustworthy, precise & fast project-level match. The Eden-match aligns beyond skills & roles - which makes it possible to “click in” external people into the company as if they were internal. We’re seeing more and more Eden based talent attraction workflows that eliminate the need for long, expensive & ineffective hiring processes completely.
2. **Engage**  
      
    Eden bursts the obscure job description bubble & reduces the information asymmetry between candidate & work. This has shifted the focus from competing for talent on extrinsic motivators such as compensation package & (vague) role to intrinsic motivators such as opportunity to master a new skill in line with a candidate’s goals & purpose. This filter works both ways - as companies get the most excited & engaged candidates and candidates start work they know they will be excited about.
3. **Retain**  
      
    It empowers companies to have people in places where their value can truly shine and empowers people to optimise for intrinsic motivators rather than extrinsic motivators - merit over role leads to people pursuing mastery & purpose in an autonomous way. The most successful companies are platforms for people to achieve their own purpose compared to the companies that aim to achieve their purpose at the expense of people. Eden is a key tool for companies to be able to achieve this.

### Eden as the **merit based opportunity equaliser**

From the get go, Eden has been laser focussed on getting the right person on the right project for the right reasons. As a product of the web3 movement, Eden operates online & is default global with the ability to use pseudonymous profiles. This means we’ve been very good at eliminating biases related to location, gender, and other factors that contribute in a skewed way to the job market signalling problem, providing great opportunities to a wider range of individuals who used to not have access to these. This unlocks over half the world when it comes to talent - increasing the chances of every person finding the exact right person or opportunity they are looking for.

### P**urpose on demand**

If the current match is not a good fit, the Eden network allows individuals to quickly find a new opportunity while armed with the knowledge & increased credibility gained from their previous experience. This helps them continue to establish themselves within the Eden Talent Network and get closer to work they love with each step. That level of flexibility is crucial as finding your purpose is not like turning on a switch - but once you do flip on that switch, you become unstoppable. That is what we aim to enable with Eden - it’s better for the companies hiring through Eden & it’s better for the people finding work through Eden. We’ve achieved this by having focussed on dramatically reducing the switching cost both for companies as well as contributors.

## What did we build to achieve that impact?

> [!important] 3 layered approach to make work, work for all.

The Eden network is doubling in size every 3 months because we focus on pulling three different levers intelligently: **The protocol** level focuses on creating a secure, interoperable and efficient foundation for our ecosystem. **The network** level focuses on building a strong, responsive, sticky and welcoming community of members. And **the app level** focuses on delivering valuable and user-friendly experiences for our users in all sorts of different use-cases. By addressing the needs of these diverse groups, we are able to create a thriving ecosystem that benefits everyone involved.

### 1. Eden’s Protocol Tools

Our protocol’s tool’s main focus is twofold:

1. Scale & grow the Eden network fast & without loss of quality in searches and/or matches.

2. Maintain the Eden talent network in a way the network is optimised for highly-relevant, -responsive, -trustworthy & -context sensitive matches.

Our focus on combining (hybrid)-AI & blockchain in terms of scaling context & trust has massively paid off. We’ve been able to capitalise fully on both technologies maturing in parallel. Building the tools with the eye on a well thought out progressive decentralisation strategy is starting to pay off big time as more & more projects start to integrate the Eden talent search tools into their stack. This is turning our dream of “powering every single talent match on the planet” into more and more of a reality as projects are able to empower themselves with our most foundational building block.

### 2. The Eden Talent Network

The quality of our network is everything. We define a quality network as a highly-relevant, -responsive, -trustworthy & -context sensitive network.

Making the network have these 4 attributes is the key focus of both the protocol as well as the app layer. Our relentless focus on these 4 attributes have shielded us from “vanity metrics” trap of growing the network fast and “seeing number go up”. What really excites us is to see the quality of the network go up and that has paid off in the long run. There are 3 important elements to achieving the above stated:

1. **Easy, fun & relevant network onboarding**  
      
    We’ve struck the right balance between a low barrier to entry and capturing the most relevant information. It's easy for members to quickly establish a meaningful presence in the network, even with just a minimal time commitment. Eden’s social and intellectual-capital porting tools make it easy for members to bring their reputation and proof-of-work from other projects into Eden, adding value to tools like on- or off-chain credentials and proof-of-work projects. We are often sought out by such other projects for collaboration as we help expand the utility of their tools for their members too. This has become a meaningful growth loop for us. Together, we create a network that is not only sticky, but also fun and exciting for all who join.
2. **Sustainable & meaningful continuous network engagement**  
      
    Our crypto-economic design rewards people for verifying information about themselves and others that leads to more people being the right person on the right project for the right reasons. This has the side effect of having a very welcoming, high WAGMI-energy network as people literally earn by verifying information about & vouching for each-other. People are literally tied up in each-others’ success. The more you interact and operate within the network, the more value you receive by building your reputation in the network and training the AI, increasing the level & fit of opportunities you get access to. This creates a powerful network effect that keeps members coming back. In fact, 20% of the network finds full-time, engaging poly-work employment through Eden.
3. **Clearly understanding & serving the needs of different types of users in the network.**  
      
    Over the last 3 years we’ve developed a healthy obsession with the different types of users. We’ve identified & specified over 100s of specific use-cases & needs, but by having held on to three main “archetypes” we’ve been able to ensure that we didn’t build a “feature-soup” that resembles “faster horses” but have kept our eyes on the prize and the core value we deliver for each archetype. Those 3 archetypes are:
    - **Core Builder** are founder/company/project lead-types. As are very purpose driven individuals, they know where they want to go & are looking for the right people to help get them there. The one thing they all agree on is super valuable about Eden is they can find hyper relevant people a lot faster & cheaper than anything they’ve worked with before.
    - **Solid Contributors** are looking to work on more longterm projects & are pretty clear on their mission. They are super excited about us because we’re helping them find the places where they are maximally valued - this makes it very easy for them to be paid what they’re worth and find work that really engages & excites them. They love that every single search contains super relevant projects for them - which also makes it easy for them to switch jobs when they feel they’ve outgrown their current commitment - giving them agency over the work they do.
    - **Liquid Contributors** are excited to be part of multiple projects and/or are still kind of figuring out what their purpose is. They love that we’ve created products that let them explore across opportunities easily, all while minimising the switching cost for the company hiring.

### 3. Eden Integrations & apps

Many projects are integrating our talent search for their own projects - from talent marketplaces to internal HR tooling, effortlessly. Eden is enabling a whole ecosystem of businesses and new ways of working on top of its network. We understood that different talent pools will have different needs to interact with our protocol stack & network. Our insight is that we should make it as easy as possible to empower those who have the desire & drive to make a difference for their specific talent pools to integrate our talent search tools. In the first place to serve themselves but this is also a great way to grow the Eden network. That’s why we treat them like true partners in helping us achieve our common purpose & mission. This is reflected across the entire stack, from incentive design to having dedicated teams to support them.

Next to empowering others, we’ve had a relentless focus on blazing the trail by building the applications that we believe are game changing applications of our network & protocol stack. Some of the ideas that have been developed and refined over the past three years include:

- **Liquid labor pools**: A simple way for people with similar skills to provide "labor liquidity" to a pool for a certain number of hours per week, and sell subscriptions to their skills with a lower bound availability and quality guarantee. There is also a bonding curve attached for hours outside of the provided window, so the extra hours are available at a higher price, and a decreasing price bid in the pool for the job, so the longer the pool waits to take the job, the less the job will pay.
- **Liquid workforce plugins**: These are the software tools that enable the liquid-solid-core workforce model. Companies can use Eden software to map their staffing needs in a private organizational knowledge graph and get suggestions for perfect fits from the Eden network, effectively extending their workforce with the entire Eden network on demand. On-demand staffing agencies have also been built on top of the Eden network using these plugins, where a single consultant has sold a project that requires three specific additional people, who are hired just-in-time through the Eden network.
- **Solution pooling/grants programs**: This is when multiple organizations fund project proposals that bring together a wide variety of skillsets and share the solution that is built from it.
- **Talent search powered by Eden**: Other networks, organizations and companies are using Eden's search algorithm to power their internal talent searches.

## Who are we to have built the things that have that impact?

> [!important] a default global, liquidly evolving organisation.

### Eden m**arketing & outreach**

Our branding has been called fresh, engaging & some are even calling it iconic. The idea of Eden as a person who does the best intros to talent & jobs has made her very easy to engage with. This has informed a lot of our design decisions, from platform to the actual branding. Our Massive Transformative Purpose of empowering everyone to do what they love is a story everyone wants to be a part of. Eden as a brand is well on its was to become a life-style symbol/icon. She represents the WAGMI purpose economy. She stands for work that works for you and has initiated the movement against the “shuffle economy”.

### Eden s**ales & growth**

All of our sales & growth strategies are driven by our core tenant: attract, don’t chase. We’ve achieved this by consistently giving value before we take it. A lot of our sales & growth is driven by our own communities. We’re a very well known project in the web3 community. Being intentional about the quality vs quantity tradeoff early on is really what laid a solid foundation for growth. We know startups don’t die from starvation, but rather from indigestion. This all means that our exponential growth is sustainable.

### The Eden l**eadership team**

is basically everyone. We have this core idea of “lead, don’t manage” which combined with our culture of extreme ownership has installed this idea that great leaders create more leaders. Because everyone in our team acts as owners & leaders, we’ve realised that syncing context is hyper crucial - that way we can each lead towards the same vision & operate from a similar set of basis vectors. We’ve created a system that keeps that context synced to a MVDME (Minimal Viable Decision Making Environment) with certain responsibilities & decisions that are clearly owned by specific leaders - everyone a leader means everyone makes their own decisions and the way those decisions are distributed across the org is always very clear. This has resulted in Eden being an organisation that attracts a lot of self-starters & has been a key to our success.

### The Eden **HR vision**

is very much centered on our core tenant of personal & collective growth. For this, we’ve adapted Zappos’ pipeline model as we believe everyone can grow into the roles they are most excited about. This has created a culture of teachers - we uplevel eachother all the time. When it comes to attracting the right kind of people, we’re rated one of the most fulfilling and therefore attractive companies to work for.

### Eden **engineering**

is filled with engineers who want to work on the bleeding edge of technology & human psychology combined. We’re a deep tech company with deep empathy for what it means to be human which attracts a lof of engineers who love to work on the most challenging problems out there. Our view on AI & Blockchain as context & trust scalars has led to very creative thinking around how we use these technologies - which has resulted in many innovations that have propelled the Eden network forward. Because of this environment, our culture & us operating on the bleeding edge - we’re able to attract the best and brightest effortlessly.

### Eden financials

are turning into the great engine for impact & growth we always knew they could be. We have no issue raising money should we need to. We’ve opted to raise from community whenever we could as we envision the progressive decentralisation of the Eden protocol tools & network as essential for its longterm growth & impact. Our revenue is getting to a point where everyone who’s believed & contributed to Eden is rewarded for the selfless, hard work they’ve been putting in over the past 3 years.
