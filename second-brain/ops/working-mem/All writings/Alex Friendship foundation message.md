Dear Alex,

I hope this message finds you well. Jk jk jk

Alright dude - couple things I want to talk to you abt: 1) why it looks like I won’t be able to get over you in the next 400 years 2) why that doesn’t need to be a problem to build an epic, active friendship & why we should 3) how I think we can do that where it’s all good vibes (like actually).

There’s no way we can actually build a true friendship if we don’t clear some of this stuff up. That’s what I’m trying to do here - I’m being as open & honest as I know how to today, such that there’s no weird undertones in our interactions moving forward.

Starting with 1 - none of this shit makes sense. We met half a year ago - spent a grand total of 4 quarter-days together and then I felt this cartaghena-plane-ditching urge to fly to LA - which left us with a pretty dope story and my friends reaffirming that I’m too intense when they hear that story 🤷🏼‍♂️. That was all on intuition - I took no time to think. Only way that I can make that make sense is that intuition was/is powered by a connection/feeling that is beyond what I can understand. I guess there’s always the option of mental illness - but we’ll leave that aside for now.

I’ve tried to “do the work” to “get over you” in the last month and tbh - “this ain’t my first rodeo”, as they say. You’re not my first time where I actively want to get over someone. I don’t think I’ve lived in the same place for longer than 6 months (except for pandemic) in the last 8 years and that comes with its fair share of goodbyes. That means I lowkey have a “protocol” on how to deal with getting over someone - usually it takes me 3 days lol. Not with you.

When I try to “get over you” it’s like trying to stop a river from flowing. I really think that what’s here is v special. I think you’re super special. ofc I can’t speak for you and I won’t. And I hope you’ve felt that I’ve done nothing but respect your boundaries. But have you ever tried to stop a river from flowing? Wasted energy trying to do that. Hence, I realised I will never be able to get over you - BUT, I realised, and this is the start of point 2: what if that river can just be a base for an epic friendship? (which I know you’re prob saying “duh - is what I’ve been saying all along”)

Where I fucked up is I became obsessively attached to an outcome w you - and literally got a therapist to work through why that was & a lot of “unhealed wounds” came up through that for me. When I was 3 … jk jk DW won’t go into them here. Point being - I know where & why the shit that made this feel heavy prior came from & I’m dealing w it.

Which brings me to point 2.1 - why we should (actively) build a friendship. Remember my life-book? The book where I write down a vision for every aspect of my life. The love part does say it’s reciprocal ideally - so yeah you don’t qualify for that one anymore BUT my friendship one talks about how I want friends that challenge & inspire me. Obv check - but there’s a couple deeper things with you specifically that I don’t want to just disregard as it has been - in my experience at least - so fucking hard to find people to connect with on that level (if you read this as a purely pragmatic reason to be friend - it is. 🤷🏼‍♂️) 1) when we say our “what” we hear the “why” & respond to that saving us the eye-rolling task to thank each-other for besides-the-point-advice. Talk about feeling understood. We’d be stupid to throw that away. 2) we cut through each-other’s bullshit. And whether we like it or not, what we do requires us to wear masks from time to time and it’s nice to have people in our corner who can see through that. 3) We’re both founders on a similar timeline who have the previous two points. There’s so many things that are impossible to talk through with my other friends as they could impossibly truly get it. you can. 4) It’s effortless to talk & there are few people that can help me explore my own mind & emotions in the way you can.

Which brings me to point 3. How I think we can build an active friendship where it’s all good vibes (like actually).
