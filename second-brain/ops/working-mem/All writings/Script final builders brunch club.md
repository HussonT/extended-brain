So it’s clear that if we’re going to bring the world onchain, we’ll need to gather. To share ideas, to learn from each other, to collaborate, to connect, to accelerate, to help each other build better, faster together.

The idea of the builders brunch club is simple: friends build better, faster. We use AI-interviews & vetting with onchain reputation mechanisms to help the right builders gather for relevant reasons. This means that the intro’s made by Eden, our decentralised talent-coordination agent, will feel like intro’s from your smart, well-connected trustworthy friend.

I’ve always been an avid connector & I know personally what it can do to get such an intro to the right person & authentically connect at the right time. Some of those intro’s have literally changed the course of my life.

By joining the builders brunch club you’ll get connected to brilliant builders with complementary skills that would’ve otherwise never crossed your path. You’ll build relationships in 15 minutes with near-peers that would’ve otherwise taken you months of commenting on each-others post. In short, you’ll build a stronger network that will help you & our whole ecosystem with it build better, faster together.

So without further ado, I’m so excited to welcome you into the builders brunch club.
