Remember [that video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-husson-b30a48a1_employeengagement-web3-futureofwork-activity-6919593839372455936-m5Er?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) we made when @miltos & I were at @Entrepreneur First and saw a huge opportunity to rethink the way we work - but didn‚Äôt know what we would build yet? Well - we know now and we‚Äôve raised some money, put together a kick-ass team & we‚Äôre building it. Story timeüëá

### DAOs as the new model for work?

In our search for a new model for work, we got very excited about DAOs because of their promise for more work agency, purpose alignment with peers through communities & a digital infrastructure that works for you instead of the other way around. To better understand DAOs, we joined a couple of them. Very quickly we realised that very little of the theoretical appeal of DAOs translated to practice well. Still believing in their potential, we decided to try & solve the biggest hair-on-fire-problem we would be well suited to solve. That turned out to be talent coordination - I had launched 3 talent & technology related startups before and Miltos was on the AI team at Goldman Sachs that used Graph Convolutional Neural Networks to help get the right person on the right place for the right reasons.

### We hacked together a talent coordination bot.

We gave ourselves 2 weeks to hack something together that would help tackle talent coordination in these massive, decentralised, online communities. That birthed our talent coordination [discord-bot called Soil üå±](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-talent-coordination-bot-proposal-soil-unlock-community-powered-opportunity-s1-budget-application/2195) . It was a simple bot that would ask you for your skills & in return gave you what projects were happening in the DAO that would require your help. We applied to multiple grant programs from multiple DAOs to see if communities could see the value of what w‚Äôer building to the point that they would allocate money to further develop what it was we were building. The answer was a big YES - we received a combined $300K in grants in the form of hours contributed & community tokens.

### From DAOs to a vision beyond DAOs.

We decided to focus on 1 DAO, Developer_DAO. A DAO with 5000+ active devs - and before we knew it we had over 170 applications for volunteering contributors to join our project. Unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt onboard everyone, so we ended up with a team of contributors that hovered around a team of 25. With that team, we kept on developing our talent coordination bot further. And that‚Äôs when we started developing a vision way beyond DAOs. A vision for a talent coordination protocol for the web that empowers anyone, anywhere to do meaningful work.

### What‚Äôs the best talent match on the planet today?

For amazing talent coordination, everything starts with the right match: the right person on the right project for the right reasons. With 85% of people emotionally disengaged at work today, it‚Äôs fair to say that we‚Äôre not doing to great at matching. So we asked ourselves the question: ‚Äúwhat is the best talent match on the planet today?‚Äù - the answer: ‚Äúreferrals‚Äù. However, a problem with referrals is that they are very hard to scale. So we went one step further and asked the question: ‚Äúwhat makes referrals great?‚Äù - the answer: ‚Äúcontext & credibility.‚Äù

### Referrals are epic but scaling them is almost impossible.

Context: Referrers understand what the job candidate and employer require beyond just keywords, especially if the referrer is an expert in the field (ml engineer referring another ml engineer). Credibility: The referrer's own reputation at stake makes both parties trust the referral more and aligns incentives for all parties. The higher the context & trust, the better the chances of a successful job match. So naturally we asked the question: how could we scale context & trust based matching in a global web-wide professional network?

### Key technologies make a new paradigm possible.

If we had asked that question 3 years ago, the answer would‚Äôve been: very hard to do. Today, however things are different. We have 2 very important & impactful technologies that reached a level of maturity that are brilliant context & credibility scalars: AI & Blockchain. From that insight we developed what we now call our PageRank for people style algorithm that leverages AI & Blockchain to scale context & credibility in any talent network. This is the key to scaling referral level talent matches across the web and empowering anyone, anywhere to do meaningful work.

### Our first important step in building the talent coordination layer of the web.

Today, we‚Äôre spending all of our focus on building the ultimate tool for aspiring freelancers to use Eden to kickstart their freelancing career by leveraging their existing network to kickstart their freelance reputation. Our high-bandwidth context matching makes it possible to match a lot more precisely & effectively on a project level rather than on a role level. This is perfect for aspiring freelancers who want to start by freelancing for 5-10 hours a week.
