# Proposal Title

Authors: [discord handles, separated by commas]Supporting Budget Steward:¬†[**@budget_stewards**](https://forum.developerdao.com/groups/budget_stewards)¬†(please replace with Budget Stewards handle if/when support given)Links to previous discussion on this topic.

## Summary

_A simple description of the Budget Application. Should be no more than a few sentences._

This proposal is about continuing the Eden D_D - love ü´∂. S1 was very much a ‚Äúfiguring things out‚Äù season. Despite that, Eden‚Äôs been a place for over 50-contributors to learn, connect & build in D_D. In that light, S1 was about laying & solidifying foundations.

In S2 - we‚Äôre gearing up to collectively reap the rewards of the efforts we‚Äôve been putting in over the last 6 months. We‚Äôve identified 4 concrete opportunity tracks, decentralised opportunity matching, mentorship, hackathons & grant funding, that we aim to realise for & with the DAO in this Season. The grant funding, which has been given the Eden x D_D SEEDS program, includes a very concrete proposal around revenue share that projects a 10x ROI for the DAO.

The over-arching goal remains the same: empower everyone to be the right person on the right project for the right reasons and by doing so, turn D_D into a lush garden of opportunities where we can grow & build web3 w frens, together!

## Motivation

_Why this application and what are you hoping to achieve at a high-level._

Our high-level goal for this application is outlining concretely how we can empower more people to ‚Äújoin, play & stay‚Äù in D_D. The more the DAO attracts, engages & retains talent, the more the DAO thrives - because the DAO are its people & what they come together to do.

With that in mind, Eden is still focussed on the two pillars we outlined for this in S1: meaningfully matching people with opportunities. We have two main focusses to achieve this: (1) making talent in the DAO meaningfully searchable & (2) increasing the number of & access to quality opportunities.

We‚Äôve been able to achieve a lot in collaboration with D_D in S1 - all of the goals & challenges that were outlined in that proposal are still very much relevant & top of mind for us today (so if you haven‚Äôt read that yet, we encourage you to!). This S2 application has three additional main motivations for us:

1. Celebrate & amplify what‚Äôs working: We‚Äôve been able to achieve incredible things since S1 with many dev DAO members - we‚Äôve had over 50 different contributors and love building with D_D. Awesome game-nights were had, many new skills were learned & deep bonds were forged in the D_D <> Eden fire. We want to continue to ‚Äúbuild web3 with frens.‚Äù
2. Apply & share lessons learned: Season 1 very much felt like we were all trying to figure things out still. We want to apply & share those lessons in Season 2 to help solidify D_D‚Äôs place in the broader web3 community as a place that births amazing projects that move the needle for the entire space. Most of these lessons are reflected in this proposal.
3. Outline our sustainably beneficial future together: In S1, the exact ways of how we wanted to provide value to the DAO remained pretty vague. We understood the problem pretty well, but how exactly we would solve it remained a bit blurry. Many hours of work have been done which comes with a lot of clarity. For this proposal we‚Äôve outline 4 concrete ‚Äúvalue tracks‚Äù that we are excited to propose to the DAO.

## Mission, values and goals alignment

_How does your Project or new Guild align with the DAOs mission, values and goals._

Everything we talked about in our S1 application still holds true.

However, we‚Äôve gained a lot of additional clarity in the last season, so we want to highlight a couple of concrete ways Eden <> D_D align. First at a high level, then in 4 very concrete ways that come from that high-level alignment.

At a high level, Eden‚Äôs mission is to turn the web into a lush garden of opportunities which very much aligns with the idea of building web3 with frens. We‚Äôre building an opportunity protocol that allows anybody, anywhere to find dream talent & join stellar projects.

At a high level, this speaks to these 3 DAO goals & values specifically:

1. Talent attraction, engagement & retention: No people, no DAO. A survey showed that 9/10 people who want to contribute in the DAO, don‚Äôt find a place to contribute. That‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúwasted‚Äù talent coming through the DAO. Decentralising the way to launch & find a place to contribute in the DAO is crucial to achieve impact at scale as a DAO.
2. Diversity & Inclusion: Today, the way for you to get started creating value in the DAO is to go through all the channels, get vocal & hope that somebody knows somebody that can be helpful to you. This can be hard for people who are more introverted or are less good at ‚Äúselling themselves‚Äù. Eden creates a fairer, more accessible & meritocratic system to operate in the DAO.
3. Building web3 w frens: With the help of the D_D, Eden is well positioned to become a core web3 infrastructure that helps realise the promise of all DAOs, unlocking a huge set of opportunities for DAO members across web3 - with D_D as it‚Äôs home & birthplace.

For our S2 proposal that translates to 4 opportunity tracks with those 3 specific goals in mind on how we want to co-elevate our shared missions & values.

1. **Decentralised opportunity matching - ‚ÄúA match made in Eden‚Äù**
    1. The initial challenge we set out to solve with the Soil üå± talent coordination bot - now Eden Protocol - is still the main problem we tackle. We‚Äôve been working hard to upgrade the bot into a whole platform that makes it easy for anyone to launch a project in the DAO & find people to collaborate with on that project in a decentralised way. S2 is the season we will launch our platform in private beta in D_D. This empowers anybody in the DAO to find or create their ‚Äúspot‚Äù in the DAO according to their specific interests. This provides a more scalable yet personal education, onboarding & support path - which directly contributes to the three goals mentioned above.
2. **Mentorship - ‚ÄúEden‚Äôs mentorship matching events‚Äù**
    1. In building tooling to achieve the perfect opportunity match - we realised that an opportunity is nothing less than a couple of the right people coming together for the right reasons at the right time. Great mentorship is one of those forms of opportunities. That‚Äôs why in Season 2 we want to collaborate with D_D mentorship to achieve more, impactful & sustainable mentorship matches. Easily finding the perfect mentor in D_D can be absolutely huge in building D_D community strength & engagement which in turn, again, directly contributes to the three goals stated above.
3. **Hackathons - ‚ÄúEden‚Äôs hack-pack‚Äù**
    1. We‚Äôre a community of builders - and what better way to explore cool ideas than through Hackathons. However, a big challenge there can be finding a great team to hack with. In S2 we want to empower D_D members with the Eden tools to find each-other for hackathons more effectively. We‚Äôll explore the idea of facilitating periodical remote hackathons in D_D with Eden tooling which in term will lead to more talent attraction, engagement & retainment as we give more and more members reasons to come, play & stay in D_D. Again, directly contributing to the three goals stated above.
4. **(Grant) Funding - ‚ÄúEden x D_D - SEEDS program‚Äù**
    1. Many protocols have grant-programs to incentivise amazing builders, like we have & attract many of in D_D, to build ontop of their stack. The Eden x D_D SEEDS program gives these protocols the opportunity to spot & fund teams within D_D that show a lot of promise to build meaningful projects on top of their stack. The Eden tooling makes it possible for members to fast-track applications with the reputation they‚Äôve built up in D_D & Eden. Eden tools give insights & analytics to the protocols around who‚Äôs applying and takes away the hassle of distributing & following up on the grants on the coordination side. By being one of the first builder-daos with tooling that allows any protocol to permissionlessly post grants to to our community, we can attract many protocols to offer D_D specific grants. Again directly contributing to the three goals stated above.

## Brand usage

_How, if at all, will you use the Developer DAO Brand._

Our current version of the tool is an alpha version that is under development - we have a waitlist of other DAO‚Äôs who want to use the Eden tooling. Having D_D as the birthplace of the tool that has the potential to become core-infrastructure across all DAOs is how we would use the brand - very much in line of the idea of ‚Äúbuild web3 with friends‚Äù.

## Scope of work

_Please break down in detail how this project/guild will function and the steps for delivering value for the DAO. Be as specific as possible so members are able to help critique but also help refine your ideas._

S1 was about getting a lot of the foundations in place for Eden to be valuable to the DAO.

S2 is about realising that value with the broader D_D community.

We‚Äôve learned a lot from S1 - we ended up having 50 different contributors contributing in many different capacities & forms. We‚Äôve identified 3 main ‚Äúworking groups‚Äù and ways of contributing. We‚Äôll be scoping 3 work-forms: Core, Solid & Liquid.

1. Core contributors are full-time Eden members.
2. Solid contributors are members who can spend 10-15 hours a week building with us.
3. Liquid contributors are members who are interested in exploring if Eden would be a place for them and would work more on a bounty per bounty case.

For these types of contributors we foresee two work-streams with the following workload & scope.

Scope 1: Continue building the core tech, protocol tools & platform w core team.

1. Keep building in the way that we have - doing fast iterations & co-building with many of our DAO members - to everyone who has built, intro‚Äôd, jumped on a call with us - THANK YOU ü´∂
2. Workload:
    1. Solid contributors: 10 individual solid.
        1. 6 - full stack
        2. 2 - blockchain
        3. 2 - UX/UI
    2. Liquid contributors: Room for 20 hours of liquid contribution a week.
        1. 10 x 1h bounties
        2. 5 x 2h bounties

1. Growing the Eden network inside & outside D_D to expand the scope & availability of opportunities for D_D members.
    1. We‚Äôll be launching multiple efforts for each opportunity stream we discussed in the mission, values & goals alignment section. The work for this will be distributed in Eden‚Äôs partnership & outreach team. This team will consist of
        1. Solid contributors: 5 individual.
        2. Liquid contributors: 10 hours of liquid contribution a week.
            1. 10 x 1h bounties

## Financial implications

_Please provide a breakdown of budget calculations for either ‚Äúsalaried‚Äù roles or bounties to be distributed to contributors. Please also provide a suggested split in any revenue/value generated by the Guild/Project between contributors and the DAO Treasury_

### Investment from D_D

#### Financial implications

|Name|Number of contributors|$CODE/hour|hours/week|Total number of weeks|Total cost in $CODE|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|[[Solid Contributors]]|15|15|15|16|54000|
|[[Liquid Contributors]]|1|15|30|16|7200|

  
  

### Benefit

Besides all the intangible value creation that comes from building a healthier DAO that attracts, engages & retains talent more effectively through the 4 concrete ways we outlined earlier, we‚Äôre also thinking about value capture to make & grow this as a sustainable business loop.

The reality is that this requires experimentation, especially when dealing with completely new & innovative business scenarios that come with being on the cutting edge of organisation building - which is where DAOs very much are. Making broad comments about a general shared business model, revenue split or deal is pure speculation at this point.

What we can say is that from an Eden standpoint we‚Äôre in this to play longterm games with longterm people. We‚Äôre fighting for a purpose economy which very much includes DAOs succeeding at becoming a place to empower people to do more of what they love. Eden & D_D‚Äôs are fundamentally aligned in needing to sustainably & qualitatively grow & engage the community and that includes having a business model that makes sense on all sides.

That being said, there is a very concrete way that we envision a sustainable revenue share to work TODAY in S2:

1. Eden x D_D SEEDS program: Protocols pay a lump-sum that is disbursed over a minimum - maximum amount of grants. A cut, we propose 10%, of that lump sum is taken for the management, tracking & disbursement services on the Eden side and an additional cut, we propose an additional 10%, of that lump sum is taken for the DAO to continue funding public goods that are conducive to attracting the right kind of builders, organising the workshops & continuing the work of the D_D funding operators to create a fruitful environment for quality projects to find funding - such as down the line an incubator/accelerator etc.

  

#### Revenue projection SEED program

|Name|Number of protocols|Average lumpsum grant|Total grants disbursed in D_D|Revenue D_D|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|[[Grant funding revenue share]]|20|$50,000.00|1000000|100000|

  
  

Given the current price of the CODE token being at $0.16 - that projects a 10x ROI from the SEEDS program alone [100000/(61200*0.16)] . That‚Äôs not taking into account the different avenue that we can explore further such as cross-community monetisation, revenue split on ‚Äúfreemium‚Äù subscriptions within D_D, etc.

## Summary

This proposal is about continuing the Eden <> D_D - love ü´∂. S1 was very much a ‚Äúfiguring things out‚Äù season. Despite that, Eden‚Äôs been a place for over 50 contributors to learn, connect & build in D_D. In that light, S1 was about laying & solidifying foundations. For an overview of everything that's happened over the last Season, we've provided an overview in the [#eden channel in D_D](https://discord.com/channels/883478451850473483/986993222700126279).

In S2 - we‚Äôre gearing up to collectively reap the rewards of the efforts we‚Äôve been putting in over the last 6 months. We‚Äôve identified 4 concrete opportunity tracks: (1) decentralized opportunity matching, (2) mentorship, (3) hackathons & (4) grant funding, which we aim to realize for & with the DAO in this Season. The grant funding, which has been given to the Eden x D_D SEEDS program, includes a very concrete proposal around revenue share that projects a 10x ROI for the DAO.

The over-arching goal remains the same: empower everyone to be the right person on the right project for the right reasons and by doing so, turn D_D into a lush garden of opportunities where we can grow & build web3 w frens, together!

If you're curious as to the current state of the product - here's our latest demo:

## Motivation

Our high-level goal for this application is to outline concretely how we can empower more people to ‚Äújoin, play & stay‚Äù in D_D. The more the DAO attracts, engages & retains talent, the more the DAO thrives - because the DAO are its people & what they come together to do.

With that in mind, Eden is still focused on the two pillars we outlined for this in S1: meaningfully matching **people** with **opportunities**. We have two main focuses to achieve this: (1) making talent in the DAO meaningfully searchable & (2) increasing the number of & access to quality opportunities.

We‚Äôve been able to achieve a lot in S1 - all of the goals & challenges that were outlined in that proposal are still very much relevant & top of mind for us today [(so if you haven‚Äôt read that yet, we encourage you to!)](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-talent-coordination-bot-proposal-soil-unlock-community-powered-opportunity-s1-budget-application/2195). This S2 application has three additional main motivations for us:

1. **Celebrate & amplify what‚Äôs working**: We‚Äôve been able to achieve incredible things since S1 with many dev DAO members - we‚Äôve had over 50 different contributors and love building with D_D. Awesome game nights were had, many new skills were learned & deep bonds were forged in the D_D <> Eden fire. We want to continue to ‚Äúbuild web3 with frens.‚Äù
2. **Apply & share lessons learned**: Season 1 very much felt like we were all trying to figure things out still. We want to apply & share those lessons in Season 2 to help solidify D_D‚Äôs place in the broader web3 community as a place that births amazing projects that move the needle for the entire space. Most of these lessons are reflected in this proposal.
3. **Outline our sustainably beneficial future together**: In S1, the exact ways of how we wanted to provide value to the DAO remained pretty vague. We understood the problem pretty well, but how exactly we would solve it remained a bit blurry. Many hours of work have been done which comes with a lot of clarity. For this proposal, we‚Äôve outlined 4 concrete ‚Äúopportunity tracks‚Äù that we are excited to propose to the DAO.

## Mission, values and goals alignment

Everything we discussed in our [S1 application](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-talent-coordination-bot-proposal-soil-unlock-community-powered-opportunity-s1-budget-application/2195) still holds true. However, we‚Äôve gained a lot of additional clarity in the last season, so we want to highlight a couple of concrete ways Eden <> D_D align.

At a high level, Eden‚Äôs mission is to turn the web into a lush garden of opportunities which very much aligns with the idea of building web3 with frens. We‚Äôre building an opportunity protocol that allows anybody, anywhere to find dream talent & join stellar projects.

At a high level, this speaks to these 3 D_D goals & values specifically:

1. **Talent attraction, engagement & retention**: No people, no DAO. A survey showed that 9/10 people who want to contribute in the DAO, don‚Äôt find a place to contribute. That‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúwasted‚Äù talent coming through the DAO. Decentralizing the way to launch & find a place to contribute to the DAO is crucial to achieving impact at scale as a DAO.
2. **Diversity & Inclusion**: Today, the way for you to get started creating value in the DAO is to go through all the channels, get vocal & hope that somebody knows somebody that can be helpful to you. This can be hard for people who are more introverted or are less good at ‚Äúselling themselves‚Äù. Eden creates a fairer, more accessible & meritocratic system to operate in the DAO.
3. **Building web3 w frens**: With the help of the D_D, Eden is well positioned to become a core web3 infrastructure that helps realize the promise of all DAOs, unlocking a huge set of opportunities for DAO members across web3 - with D_D as it‚Äôs home & birthplace. It's also becoming clear that Eden is a source for a lot of learning on how the DAO wants to engage with & spin out projects. We want to continue contributing in helping the DAO mature & streamline the work that is being done around that.

For our S2 proposal that translates to 4 concrete opportunity tracks with those 3 specific goals in mind on how we want to co-elevate our shared missions & values.

1. **Decentralised opportunity matching - ‚ÄúA match made in Eden‚Äù**

The initial challenge we set out to solve with the Soil üå± talent coordination bot - now Eden Protocol - is still the main problem we tackle. We‚Äôve been working hard to upgrade the bot into a whole platform that makes it easy for anyone to launch a project in the DAO & find people to collaborate with on that project in a decentralized way. S2 is the season we will launch our platform in private beta in D_D. This empowers anybody in the DAO to find or create their ‚Äúspot‚Äù in the DAO according to their specific interests. This provides a more scalable yet personal education, onboarding & support path - which directly contributes to the three goals mentioned above.

1. **Mentorship - ‚ÄúEden‚Äôs mentorship matching events‚Äù**

In building tooling to achieve the perfect opportunity match - we realized that an opportunity is nothing less than a couple of the right people coming together for the right reasons at the right time. Great mentorship is one of those forms of opportunities. That‚Äôs why in Season 2 we want to collaborate with D_D mentorship to achieve more, impactful & sustainable mentorship matches. Easily finding the perfect mentor in D_D can be absolutely huge in building D_D community strength & engagement which in turn, again, directly contributes to the three goals stated above.

1. **Hackathons - ‚ÄúEden‚Äôs hack-pack‚Äù**  
    We‚Äôre a community of builders - and what better way to explore cool ideas than through Hackathons. However, a big challenge there can be finding a great team to hack with. In S2 we want to empower D_D members with the Eden tools to find each-other for hackathons more effectively. We‚Äôll explore the idea of facilitating periodical remote hackathons in D_D with Eden tooling which in term will lead to more talent attraction, engagement & retainment as we give more and more members reasons to come, play & stay in D_D. Again, directly contributing to the three goals stated above.  
    
2. **(Grant) Funding - ‚ÄúEden x D_D - SEEDS program‚Äù**  
    Many protocols have grant programs to incentivize amazing builders, like we have & attract many of in D_D, to build ontop of their stack. The Eden x D_D SEEDS program gives these protocols the opportunity to spot & fund teams within D_D that show a lot of promise to build meaningful projects on top of their stack. The Eden tooling makes it possible for members to fast-track applications with the reputation they‚Äôve built up in D_D & Eden. Eden tools give insights & analytics to the protocols around who‚Äôs applying and takes away the hassle of distributing & following up on the grants on the coordination side. By being one of the first builder-daos with tooling that allows any protocol to permissionlessly post grants to our community in a way that is 10x more professional than an airtable, we can attract many protocols to offer D_D-specific grants. Again directly contributing to the three goals stated above.  
    

## Brand usage

Our current version of the tool is an alpha version that is under development - we have a waitlist of other DAO‚Äôs who want to use the Eden tooling. Having D_D as the birthplace of the tool that has the potential to become core-infrastructure across all DAOs is how we would use the brand - very much in line of the idea of ‚Äúbuild web3 with friends‚Äù.

## Scope of work

S1 was about getting a lot of the foundations in place for Eden to be valuable to the DAO.

S2 is about realising that value with the broader D_D community.

We‚Äôve learned a lot from S1 - we ended up having 50 different contributors contributing in many different capacities & forms. We‚Äôve identified 3 main ‚Äúworking groups‚Äù and ways of contributing. We‚Äôll be scoping 3 work-forms: Core, Solid & Liquid.

1. Core contributors are full-time Eden members.
2. Solid contributors are members who can spend 10-15 hours a week building with us.
3. Liquid contributors are members who are interested in exploring if Eden would be a place for them and would work more on a bounty per bounty case. We are requesting budget to sponsor the D_D members who want to contribute to Eden as Solid & Liquid contributors.

For these types of contributors, we foresee two workstreams with the following workload & scope.

Scope 1: Continue building the core tech, protocol tools & platform w the team in the way that we have & that is clearly working - doing fast iterations & co-building with many of our DAO members - to everyone who has built, intro‚Äôd, jumped on a call with us - THANK YOU ü´∂

Workload 1:  
1. Solid contributors: 10 contributors.  
  
1. 6 - full stack  
2. 2 - blockchain  
3. 2 - UX/UI  
2. Liquid contributors: Room for 20 hours of liquid contribution a week.  
1. 10 x 1h bounties  
2. 5 x 2h bounties  

Scope 2: Growing the Eden network inside & outside D_D to expand the scope & availability of opportunities for D_D members. We‚Äôll be launching multiple efforts for each opportunity stream we discussed in the mission, values & goals alignment section. The work for this will be distributed in Eden‚Äôs partnership & outreach team.

Workload 2:  
1. Solid contributors: 5 contributors.  
2. Liquid contributors: 10 hours of liquid contribution a week.  
1. 10 x 1h bounties  

## Financial implications

### D_D investment

### Benefit

Besides all the intangible value creation that comes from building a healthier DAO that attracts, engages & retains talent more effectively through the 4 concrete ways we outlined earlier, we‚Äôre also thinking about value capture to make & grow this as a sustainable business loop.

The reality is that this requires experimentation, especially when dealing with completely new & innovative business scenarios that come with being on the cutting edge of organization building - which is where DAOs very much are. Making broad comments about a general shared business model, revenue split or deal is pure speculation at this point.

We can say that from an Eden standpoint, we‚Äôre in this to play long-term games with long-term people. We‚Äôre fighting for a purpose economy which very much includes DAOs succeeding at becoming a place to empower people to do more of what they love. Eden & D_D are fundamentally aligned in needing to sustainably & qualitatively grow & engage the community and that includes having a business model that makes sense on all sides.

That being said, there is a very concrete way that we envision a sustainable revenue share to work TODAY in S2:

1. Eden x D_D SEEDS program: Protocols pay a lump sum that is disbursed over a minimum - maximum amount of grants. A cut, we propose 10%, of that lump sum is taken for the management, tracking & disbursement services on the Eden side, and an additional cut, we propose an additional 10%, of that lump sum is taken for the DAO to continue funding public goods that are conducive to attracting the right kind of builders, organizing the workshops & continuing the work of the D_D funding operators to create a fruitful environment for quality projects to find funding - such as down the line an incubator/accelerator etc.

Given the current price of the CODE token is at $0.16 - that projects a 10x ROI from the SEEDS program alone [100000/(61200*0.16)]. That‚Äôs not taking into account the different avenues that we can explore further such as cross-community monetization, revenue split on ‚Äúfreemium‚Äù subscriptions within D_D, etc.
