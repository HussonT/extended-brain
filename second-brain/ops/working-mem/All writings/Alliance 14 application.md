## Distribution

You may also mention businesses that have expressed formal interest, even if they haven't started your product yet.Note that it’s perfectly reasonable to have low numbers or not even have launched yet – that’s often the case for most accepted startups.

What's your distribution strategy?*

How do you plan to get users for your product?

How big could your product become?*

## Fundraising

Tell us about your fundraising history.*

Which Alliance track applies to you from an investment perspective?*

For 9 out 10 startups going through the program, Alliance invests $350k at a $5M valuation via SAFE with a token side letter (Standard Deal).  
  
However, we've made exceptions for teams that either have strong product-market fit or in deep tech (e.g. L1/L2, ZkVM).  
  
If unsure, please select “Standard Deal”. The majority of applicants selecting the “Non-Standard Deal” do not qualify as such.  

- Standard Deal: We're looking to raise $350k from Alliance at the standard $5M post-money valuation.
- Non-Standard Deal: We have strong product-market fit or are in deep tech. We qualify as an exception.
