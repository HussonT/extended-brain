# Find your web3 people to do great work with thanks to Eden - the AI with countless friends in online communities.

## Eden interviews everyone in web3 communities & rewards community members for vouching for each-other by distributing the hiring bounty amongst the vouchers.

Eden is the trustworthy AI that refers talent & opportunities across the web. The way you find talent or a job through Eden is literally by talking to her about your talents and aspirations or the opportunity you’re looking to hire talent for & she’ll connect you with the precision, thoughtfulness & care of your most well-connected, smart friend.

What’s extra cool about Eden, is the way she spin up her talent network. Any online community can generate a unique Eden-link through which they can onboard their own audience into Eden’s network. Communities can create talent-gates: those who have specific rules about who they let in are likely to produce a better hiring signal for their talent & will therefore end up getting more of them hired. For each talent that enters the Eden network through their communities talent-gates, the community-owner/multi-sig gets an NFT-key representing a claim to a % of their future hiring bounty, distributed when they get hired through Eden. Community members can also buy each-other’s keys as a sign of conviction in abilities & get rewarded for backing the right talent.

Hiring well is hard in general. But in web3 it’s especially hard because few of the established avenues such as LinkedIn or big job-boards work to find the right people. Most of the talent is to be found in online communities and remains hidden behind twitter, discord & telegram pfps. In web3 it’s not uncommon to be 2 calls in to realise that you’re talking to a pseudonymous scammer. Where through established channels & assuming you’ve got $$$ to throw at the problem the average time to fill a role is 2-3 weeks, in web3 that is minimum 6.
