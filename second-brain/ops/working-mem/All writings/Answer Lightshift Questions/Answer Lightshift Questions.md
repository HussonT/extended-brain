Hi,

1. Yup - we’re using them in mentor <> mentee matching events inorder to iterate the algorithm “in the wild” (see screenshot), but these are quite rudementary as the data we have is pretty limited. The magic really happens when we index across the entire DAO’s discord. And we’re a couple of weeks out of having our standalone beta released in developer DAO - this is one of the reasons we’re raising, is to be able to accelerate the data intake & algorithm development. If useful, we have a recording of the entire event here so you can see it in action - also happy making a video demoing the event page in particular - or we can jump on a call and can explain how it works real quick - just lmk :) : [https://www.loom.com/share/c16d92b8d1584c7b9d98b39156bc2359](https://www.loom.com/share/c16d92b8d1584c7b9d98b39156bc2359)

2. Happy to give you access to the figma’s here: [https://www.figma.com/files/project/68272183/Team-project?fuid=560475503030266805](https://www.figma.com/files/project/68272183/Team-project?fuid=560475503030266805) , here’s a quick internal video about how we organise our figma files: [https://share.descript.com/view/faPb7Q3Gs4S](https://share.descript.com/view/faPb7Q3Gs4S) - we used to have one big figma file where we created the whole app - you can access that here: [https://www.figma.com/file/kilODLeVBrX7xyAzMBlXXy/Eden?node-id=33%3A64&t=HC4lcGWRzorwb9Ka-1](https://www.figma.com/file/kilODLeVBrX7xyAzMBlXXy/Eden?node-id=33%3A64&t=HC4lcGWRzorwb9Ka-1) , but very quickly we noticed that was confusing when you’re working with so many - so we split it up in user flows (as you’ll be able to see on the video) - the way that we build right now is also optimised for speed of iteration, instead of speed of delivery - as we want to build the right thing and care a little less about building things right at this stage, if that makes sense. Happy to clarify more on how exactly we build, because it is a bit different than traditional product cycles go - it’s build, measure, learn on steroids pretty much.
3. In terms of roadmap for the next 6 months:
    1. We’re doing product led protocol development, in that sense, our philosophy around building is very much, hack value before you hack growth - we want to cut as many unnecessary features as possible and focus on building the AI, knowledge graph, blockchain, UX & data capture in such a way that the 4 user stories listed below feel like magic in any type of use-case powered by the protocol - we’re starting with hackathons & DAOs but quickly want to move to talent marketplaces built on top of the Eden Protocol & Network. That’s the core piece of value we want to deliver really, really well and we believe are in a position to do better than anybody else because of that combination of AI (scaling context) & blockchain (scaling trust & truthfulness of data)
        
        1. As a contributor I want to be able to quickly find a project or person to collaborate with so I can find my place in the DAO/Hackathon/Society, have impact & feel valued
        2. As a project leader/founder I want to quickly be able to launch my project & find the right people to collaborate with so I can move my project forward effectively & capital efficiently
        3. As a contributor I want to build my profile & reputation so I can have access to better opportunities more quickly such as unlocking grants & joining high quality projects
        4. As a project leader/founder I want to build the profile & reputation of my project so I can attract better contributors, grants & funding.
        
        High level timeline
        
        1. January: release dev_dao private beta, partnered hackathon private beta & private beta EMIP program with partnered protocols with v0.1 of protocol
            1. Main objectives: iterate on the AI, Blockchain & protocol side of things with a “flood” of user data & usage at scale (up until now, we’ve not given anyone access to our platform without jumping on a call with them to user test - you have access to all those videos too btw)
            2. Test some of the revenue flows with the grants disbursement etc.
            3. Launch testnet token & start first test cohort
        2. February: expand private beta to 5 DAOs, 5 hackathons & 5 Protocols
            1. Same objectives as January - but wider with wider variety of use-cases, one of the signed up beta testers is Valley DAO - which will have a vastly different skill taxonomy than developer DAO - we’ll need to build & cope with that.
            2. Develop tooling for communities to be able to manage their own skill taxonomies
        3. March: refinement of private beta - exactly same objectives - stabilise & iterate the product - add 5 protocols
            1. Discover & develop cross monetisation opportunities for talent communities
        4. April: Private Beta growth - 10 DAOs - 10 (new) hackathons - 20 protocols
            1. Same objectives as march +
            2. Discover & develop premium features
        5. May: Private Beta growth Stabilisation - same objectives as april
        6. June: Be ready for public beta.
