## Help the Solana ecosystem find each other in work they love.

### Introduction

For the Solana ecosystem to flourish, builders with similar missions, interests and complementary abilities need to be able find each other to build better, together. Today, it is relatively random & cumbersome/difficult to find value-aligned builders across the ecosystem. We’re excited to see how we might use what we’ve built at Eden to make that a lot easier together with Nick.

### Objectives

- Use Eden’s trustworthy AI to help builders find each-other for the right reasons, faster.
- Come up with a plan on how we bootstrap talent supply together
- Sketch out the ideal experience, a timeline & clear next steps
- Start small, go big → what does this look like when we adopt it across the Solana ecosystem? How do we get there?

### Roles and Responsibilities

- How should we drive this together
- who’s responsible for what?
- How do we make sure it’s worth both of our time?

### Project Timeline

- A v1 up & running by end of the month march 2024

### Expected Outcomes

- A fully functional intelligent job-board that caters to the needs of both job seekers and employers.
- A fully functional AI-managed talent collective that automatically matches the right people for the right reasons.

### Next steps?

- Design v1 of the solana branded job-board
