# Socially aware AI that turns any professional into a super-connector who gets more done with others.

> **Nobody wins alone.**

The first question when doing anything worth doing is who. Who else needs to be involved to make this a success? Finding the right person at the right moment can make or break your deal, team, company, career, (love)-life… So no wonder that we spend so much energy [e-mails, dms, posts, calls, conferences,…] finding an exceptional answer to that “who” question.

For 1000’s of years Dunbars’ number has limited the ready answer we might have to the “who” question. Things have dramatically changed since consumer internet 30 years ago, Linkedin is 22 years ago & Facebook 21 years ago. Although we now have direct access to many more people -it’s clear dunbar’s number is telling us something about how suited we are for this new world where all of us deal with overload & excessive noise. In many ways, these changes have made it harder to answer that who question effectively & confidently.

> **We believe all of us could be dramatically more successful if we had better tools to navigate relationships in this post-dunbar world.**

Our vision is to build a personal network ai-assistant that operates with deep awareness of your social context to help you, for whatever endeavor you want to undertake next, effectively answer that “who” question by maximally leveraging your personal influence & that of your warm network.

### The problem: spamming is ineffective [but cheap], referrals are effective [but expensive].

Referrals convert 4x better than cold outreach, yet <5% of sales & hiring touches are referral-based because identifying, requesting, and rewarding warm intros is still manual busy‑work to work around:

1. **Discovery friction:** Your contacts have the intros you need, but neither side knows it.
2. **Request friction:** Asking for help forces contacts to search their memory and craft context. Most never do.
3. **Incentive mis‑alignment:** Helpers rarely capture the upside of a great intro, so they don’t prioritize it.

### The solution: Make referrals cheaper without making them less effective.

andwho’s socially‑aware AI makes that entire loop frictionless, but doesn’t automate any of the parts that carry all the signal - which is the actual sending of the message & vouching for the either party’s relevance.

**Andy, the Andwho AI agent**

- 90‑second secure upload of a contact list (CSV, LinkedIn, CRM).
- GraphRAG relational context scoring → surfaces the _right_ prospects for each user.
- Autogenerated ask + reward offer → one‑click send from the helper’s inbox.
- CRM‑style tracking & reward settlement (cash, credits, crypto, gift cards).

Outcome: 10× more warm intros, 2‑3× higher close rates, zero extra effort for the helper.
