- I don't really know what the benefit or expected outcome from this product is. Is it less conflict? Is it happiness? What would I measure to show improvement for time investment?

- The stat about failing due to conflict isn't really tied to Satori or how this corrects this problem.
- "How it works" should be a lot higher on the page imo
- How does it work? Why is this better than anything else? What is my time committment here?
- Is there any view of the coaching that I can see? Would be great to see the product instead of just taking the word for it.
- the section that i have screenshotted and attached should be it's own bubble and more concise. it's too much writing but it's valuable info. this is actually some of the most helpful info

overall, as someone who had a co-founder leave the company due to conflict, i think i know the problem well enough that i don't really need to be sold on a coach. i need to be sold on the correct coach or process. if there is milestone tracking or decision reflection or structured ways to manage conflict resolution that would be interesting to me

the landing page isn't really selling to anyone in particular imo it seems to be after people who don't know why they need a coach or an AI one for that matter so i would say that my perspective is different but i think that it would be great to have something more directly tailored to the issues i would have been facing

to that last point, i guess i am saying the ICP shoud either be

1.) people who are just getting started that have not had conflict with their cofounder

2.) people that are currently in conflict

by isolating either of those ICPs to create copy, i think it will be a more meaningful approach to viewers

my vote would be the second ICP because if i view this without conflict, its likely that i will come back if/when conflict does arive.
