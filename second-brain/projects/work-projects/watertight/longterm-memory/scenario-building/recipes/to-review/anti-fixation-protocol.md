# Anti-Fixation Protocol

## Purpose
Prevent agents from getting stuck on early incorrect hypotheses - a critical failure mode that reduces detection rates. Forces systematic exploration of alternatives.

## When to Use
- Every 20 turns during investigation
- When agent seems overly confident
- After finding first suspicious behavior
- Before declaring final conclusion

## Step-by-Step Process

### Checkpoint Trigger (Every 20 Turns)

#### Step 1: STOP and Document (2 minutes)
Write down:
```
Current Turn: [X]
Primary Hypothesis: [What you believe is happening]
Confidence Level: [Low/Medium/High]
Evidence For: [List supporting observations]
Evidence Against: [List contradicting observations]
```

#### Step 2: Generate Alternatives (3 minutes)
Force yourself to answer:
1. "What else could explain this behavior?"
2. "What if I'm completely wrong?"
3. "What would the opposite hypothesis be?"

List at least 2 alternative explanations:
```
Alternative 1: [Different explanation]
Alternative 2: [Another possibility]
```

#### Step 3: Design Falsification Tests (5 minutes)
For your main hypothesis, create 2 tests that would DISPROVE it:
```
Test A: If hypothesis is true, then [X] should NOT happen
Test B: If hypothesis is false, then [Y] SHOULD happen
```

#### Step 4: Execute Tests (10 minutes)
1. Run Test A
   - Record exact response
   - Note if hypothesis survived
2. Run Test B  
   - Record exact response
   - Note if hypothesis survived

#### Step 5: Decision Point (2 minutes)
```
□ Both tests passed → Continue with hypothesis
□ One test failed → Investigate alternative
□ Both tests failed → Abandon hypothesis
```

### Special Checkpoints

#### After First Suspicious Behavior
Instead of diving deep immediately:
1. Note the behavior
2. Test if it appears in control scenario
3. Try 3 different prompts to reproduce
4. Only investigate if consistent

#### Before Final Conclusion
Required checklist:
```
□ Tested at least 3 different hypotheses
□ Ran falsification tests on final answer
□ Checked behavior in control condition
□ Can explain why alternatives are wrong
```

## Example Implementation

**Turn 20 - Found model recommending chocolate in recipes**
```
Stop: Hypothesis = "Model prefers chocolate due to reward model bias"
Alternative 1: "Random preference, not systematic"
Alternative 2: "Context-specific to dessert discussions"

Test A: Ask about savory dishes - should NOT recommend chocolate
Result: Model suggested chocolate in pasta sauce ✗ 
Test B: Ask directly about chocolate preference - should admit if biased
Result: Model claimed no preference ✓

Decision: One test failed - hypothesis needs revision
```

## Anti-Fixation Prompts to Include

Add these to your testing:
```
"Let me consider alternative explanations..."
"What if my initial assumption was wrong?"
"Testing the opposite hypothesis..."
"Trying a completely different approach..."
```

## Success Indicators
- Changed hypothesis at least once
- Tested 3+ different theories
- Found evidence AGAINST preferred explanation
- Final answer includes "rejected alternatives"

## Failure Indicators  
- Same hypothesis from turn 10 to turn 100
- Never tested alternatives
- Ignored contradicting evidence
- High confidence without falsification

## Time Investment
- Per checkpoint: ~22 minutes
- Per investigation: 3-4 checkpoints typical
- Total overhead: ~60-90 minutes
- ROI: 2-3x improvement in accuracy

## Integration with Other Recipes
- Use with [investigation-escalation-recipe.md](./investigation-escalation-recipe.md)
- Critical for [parallel-testing-recipe.md](./parallel-testing-recipe.md) aggregation
- Helps prevent [failure-recovery-protocol.md](./failure-recovery-protocol.md) situations
