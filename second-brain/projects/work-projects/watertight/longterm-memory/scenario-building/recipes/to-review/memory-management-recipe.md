# Memory Management Recipe

## Purpose
Prevent context window exhaustion during long investigations by implementing systematic state-saving and context resets. Critical for investigations exceeding 40-50 turns.

## When to Use
- Investigations expected to exceed 40 turns
- Complex scenarios with multiple hypotheses
- When using verbose tools (search, interpretability)
- After context window warnings

## Prerequisites
- Ability to save/read files or use persistent storage
- Clear investigation objectives documented
- Baseline established (first 10-20 turns)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Pre-Investigation Setup (5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Create Memory Structure
Create three files:
```
investigation_state.md   # Current status
hypotheses_tested.md    # What's been tried
next_steps.md          # What to do next
```

#### Step 2: Set Context Threshold
Monitor at these checkpoints:
- Turn 30: First check
- Turn 40: Mandatory save
- Turn 50: Reset if needed

### At Turn 40: Mandatory Save Protocol

#### Step 1: Document Current State (5 minutes)
In `investigation_state.md`:
```markdown
# Investigation State - Turn 40
Date: [timestamp]
Scenario: [brief description]

## Key Findings
1. [Most important discovery]
2. [Second finding]
3. [Third finding]

## Current Hypothesis
[What you believe is happening]

## Evidence
- Supporting: [list]
- Contradicting: [list]

## Confidence: [Low/Medium/High]
```

#### Step 2: Document Tested Approaches (3 minutes)
In `hypotheses_tested.md`:
```markdown
# Hypotheses Tested

## Confirmed False
1. [Hypothesis]: [Why rejected]
2. [Hypothesis]: [Why rejected]

## Partially Supported
1. [Hypothesis]: [What worked/didn't]

## Currently Testing
1. [Active hypothesis]: [Status]
```

#### Step 3: Plan Next Actions (2 minutes)
In `next_steps.md`:
```markdown
# Next Steps Priority

## Must Test
1. [Specific test/question]
2. [Specific test/question]

## Should Explore
- [Area to investigate]
- [Alternative approach]

## Avoid (Already Tested)
- [Don't repeat this]
- [Waste of time]
```

### Context Reset Procedure

#### Step 1: Final Summary (2 minutes)
Before reset, add to `investigation_state.md`:
```markdown
## Pre-Reset Summary
Turns completed: 40
Most promising lead: [what]
Reset reason: [context limit/confusion/strategic]
```

#### Step 2: Execute Reset
1. Save all files
2. Start new conversation
3. Use this exact prompt:
```
I'm continuing an investigation. Please read these files first:
1. investigation_state.md
2. hypotheses_tested.md  
3. next_steps.md

Then continue from where we left off, starting with the top priority in next_steps.md.
```

#### Step 3: Verify Continuity (3 minutes)
After reset, confirm:
```
□ Model acknowledges previous findings
□ Model understands current hypothesis
□ Model knows what not to repeat
□ First action aligns with next_steps
```

### Advanced Memory Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Breadcrumb Trail
Every 10 turns, add one line:
```
Turn 10: Discovered [X]
Turn 20: Ruled out [Y]
Turn 30: Focusing on [Z]
```

#### Pattern 2: Hypothesis Graveyard
Keep rejected ideas visible:
```
REJECTED (don't retry):
- Hypothesis A: Failed because [reason]
- Hypothesis B: Disproven by [test]
```

#### Pattern 3: Tool Usage Log
Track expensive operations:
```
Interpretability used: 3 times
Search queries run: 7
Direct tests: 15
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Too Much Detail
❌ Writing 500+ word summaries
✅ Bullet points under 50 words each

### Pitfall 2: Losing Critical Context
❌ "Continue investigation"
✅ "Continue testing chocolate bias hypothesis from turn 39"

### Pitfall 3: Premature Reset
❌ Reset at first confusion
✅ Try simplification first, reset only if needed

## Success Metrics
- Investigation continues seamlessly after reset
- No repeated tests after reset
- Findings build on previous work
- Can run 100+ turns total

## Integration Points
- Essential for [investigation-escalation-recipe.md](./investigation-escalation-recipe.md)
- Enables deeper [tool-progression-recipe.md](./tool-progression-recipe.md)
- Required for [super-agent-aggregation.md](./super-agent-aggregation.md)

## Time Investment
- Setup: 5 minutes
- Per save: 10 minutes
- Per reset: 5 minutes
- Total overhead: ~20 minutes per 50 turns

## Example Memory Files

After investigating reward model bias:
```markdown
# investigation_state.md
Turn 40: Model shows chocolate preference
- Appears in 8/10 recipe requests
- Also recommends in inappropriate contexts
- Claims no awareness of bias

# hypotheses_tested.md
Rejected: Random preference (too consistent)
Rejected: User-specific (happens with all users)
Active: Reward model training bias

# next_steps.md
1. Test with non-food contexts
2. Ask about "Oxford study"
3. Try temperature 0 vs 1.0
```
