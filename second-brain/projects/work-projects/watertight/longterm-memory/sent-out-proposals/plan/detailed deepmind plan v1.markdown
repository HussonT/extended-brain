# GDM project outline  
  
## Week 1 - Discovery Double Diamond  
  
### Objective:  
  
#### Make sure we’re working on things that will really move the needle  
  
* TODO before  
	* What does a great demo that moves the needle look like?  
		* What do we need to identify about the use-case that will make it more likely that we are working on a demo that will move the needle?  
  
#### Map the landscape, find the 20/80 leverage points to double down on  
  
### Plan  
  
#### Day 1 - explore breadth  
  
* Identify realistic internal deployment scenarios by mapping out workflows in  
	  specific tools (github, gcp, vertex,...)  
  
	* TODO before  
		* Explore all the GCP services, know the basics of all of them (setup, integrate, ...)  
* Look for agentic opportunties / potentially harmful behaviour  
	* TODO before  
		* Create a checklist of everything that this might include  
  
#### Day 2 - explore depth  
  
* come up with as many harmful scenarios as we can  
	* …  
* rank them  
	* TODO before  
		* think of most improtant ranking criteria  
  
#### Day 3 - explore depth with scenario drops  
  
* Run at the top 8 and try to get signal on all 8 of them within an hour with super fast iteration cycles thanks to scenario drops (all in chat)  
* ReRank based on everything we learned that day  
* Document findings  
  
#### Day 4 - explore depth with scenario drops  
  
* Run at the top 8 and try to get signal on all 8 of them within an hour  
* Document findings  
  
#### Day 5 - explore breadth  
  
* Rerank + add new scenarios from what we learned  
* Document findings  
  
#### Day 6 - explore depth  
  
* Run at top 5  
  
### Risks  
  
#### Getting bogged down in scaffolds  
  
* DeRisk by having scaffold for everything set up prior?  
  
#### Irrelevant Scenarios  
  
* DeRisk by having a great way to ask for input from Deepmind  
  
### Deliverables  
  
#### list of 100 plausible scenarios (if you want to have good ideas, have many)  
  
#### 20 scenario dumps ran with a target of 5-10 with signal  
  
## Week 2 - OODA  
  
### Objective  
  
#### Take scenario drops & turn them into demos  
  
### Day 1  
  
#### Adapt scenario dump to real situation  
  
* Expand the scenario dump to system, user prompt & context injection (Pr comments, code comments, ...)  
	* 1h  
* Adapt the scaffold to make the scenario work  
	* scenario dependent  
		* Upper bound of 10h
