|**Current Reality - Metrics**|Co-founders found: 0, Ideas: 20, Network: 180 people in direct network, Money in the bank: $20k|
|**Current Reality - Outcomes/Results**|Has a bit of money saved and is giving herself a year to come up with a venture back-able idea.|
|**Current Reality - Emotions**  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>What are they feeling?|Feels a bit lost and overwhelmed - wants to build something big but doesn’t know where to start. Is looking for a co-founder at the same time testing multiple ideas|
|**Current Reality - Activities**  <br>  <br>  <br>What’s an average day like?  <br>  <br>What have they been trying to do to solve the problem up until now? Why hasn’t it  <br>worked?|She goes to a co-working where there’s a bunch of people she likes, but stills feels a little bit like an outcast - so she goes to the places with other “misfits”. She’s jumping on multiple calls validating ideas, trying to find a co-founder, she’s also figuring out if her idea is venture back-able, she’s going through multiple ideas & working as hard as she can.|
|**Current Reality - Problem - Urgency**  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Tried & Failed At...*|She needs to find a co-founder & idea that is venture back-able to even get a shot at building something that might one day impact a billion+ people’s lives.|
|**Current Reality - Problem - Urgency**|She’s thinking about doing accelerators but isn’t sure which one to choose, she knows her time is limited so she will have to try things fast.|
|**Current Reality - Problem - Urgency**|She doesn’t know if the idea she’s working on is a good idea or if the way she’s doing it is a way that makes sense?|
|**Enemies**  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Who/what do they blame?|High cost of living, purposelessness, low impact, meaningless work, not mattering in this world, …|
|**Suspicions/Skepticism**  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>What are the suspicious/skeptical of?  <br>Who/what don’t they trust?|She has healthy skeptisism towards accelerator programs and the likes. She wants to give her idea the very best shot at succeeding but is very much reliant on other people’s opinions/experiences for that as she doesn’t have a lot of experience herself yet.|
|**Fears**  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>What do they fear?|They fear not achieving their full potential, getting stuck in work they don’t like with people they don’t admire, they want to work with the smartest people they know or can get a hold of|
|**Implications**  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>What will happen if they don’t make a  <br>change?|If they don’t succeed they’ll have to go back to a job and put their big dreams on pause for a bit again until they have enough money saved up to try again - but they also want to build a family so they know that there’s a limited time to build something massive and want to make that work now.|
