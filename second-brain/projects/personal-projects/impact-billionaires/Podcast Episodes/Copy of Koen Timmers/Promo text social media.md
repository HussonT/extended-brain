podcast episode is here! And in it, we're talking to somebody who's an impact millionaire at least. None other than

[Koen Timmers, FRSA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAEu8E4BUlt4YuvvMOjLd5yoGSxd1cPkIlQ)

- author, speaker, global teacher prize winner and all around impact champion.

In this episode Koen talks to us about i.a. what it takes to build and grow the now 2.5+ million strong and growing Climate Action project, what his strategies are to have maximum impact with minimal resources & the importance and skills required to "work the network". 🧐

What I find most inspiring about Koen is that he leaves you with no excuse not to have an impact yourself. He is so genuine & down to earth yet so focussed on this massive impact. What he's been able to achieve on nothing but sheer drive is without a doubt something to admire & aspire to. 🙏
