Hi & Welcome to the very deep dive episode of the impact billionaires. Before we do dive deeper, let me start by thanking you for your patience. To tell you the truth, I thought I would have the rhythm of content creation down by now, but turns out I don't - yet.

  

Anyway, I'm so glad you're here today because we are going to explore a very interesting idea that came up during the very first episode of the impact billionaires with dave erasmus. I hope it's going to change your thinking forever as it did mine exploring this topic further. The economics of giving.

  

To give you some context again: The intended format for the impact billionaires is that every two weeks we do an interview with an actual or aspiring impact billionaire and we dive deeper in a deep dive episode into one or more interesting concepts that came up during the conversation slash interview with our guest impact billionaire. This deep dive is intended to give you insight thought starters, conversation starters pretty much anything that I believe could play a crucial role if we are to find our way to impacting a billion+ people's lives. Today that topic is the "economy of giving". Let me roll you the clip where dave spoke about that so eloquently.

"The mathematics & the economics of love completely transcend the homo economicus rational man model we have for humans." When Dave was speaking about this during our episode, I remember getting so excited because it felt like he was voicing parts of the future that I dream of. A future of abundance mindsets, positive sum games and giving in contrast to our current scarcity mindsets, mostly zero sum games & getting mentality. Is it really that "irrational" to give or is there a way of looking at the world where giving makes more sense than getting?

  

To me it's clear that this question is bigger than one single answer can even pretend to cover in a 10 minute deep dive episode. Doing research for this episode I uncovered a lot of trends that support this core idea of us living in a time where a focus on giving is economically more interesting than getting for the economy as a whole but also for the individual. Today, I will attempt to illustrate this with a set of concrete examples that show clear characterestics of either the giving versus the getting economy.

  

The concrete example I want to discuss today is how open source vs pattents are 2 ways of enabling innovation & economics growth. With open source reflecting the key characteristics of the giving economy & patents of our current, "getting" economy.

  

Turns out a lot of value in our modern world is already generated by products of the "giving economy". Open Source Projects drive a lot, and i do mean a lot, of our economic productivity today. Chances are you are the benefactor of many open source multiple times throughout your day. A lot of the internet runs on open source projects. A lot of companies use open source projects in their own offering. For those of you who don't know what open source projects are, let me explain it to you real quick.

  

Open source is defined as software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. Normally, what companies or people with a scarcity mindset would do when they write code, is make sure that other people or companies can't see or access the source code as others could just copy the code & run the program without paying for it. In open source, you do the opposite. You allow anybody to copy your code without paying for it and you allow everybody to make modifications and contribute. This is a perfect example of what Dave spoke about: I give you something, and now we both have something and that something becomes even bigger and has even more impact: a positive sum game!

  

You might be thinking: but Tom, what about the countless hours these people have been putting in coding these programs without getting payed? Don't they have families? How are they going to feed their childeren with more code? What about their bills to pay? And I would say: absolutely, they should be getting payed but i think it's exactly this that shows that "The homo economicus rational man model we have for humans" is not an accurate reflection of what makes our economy flourish.

  

Yes, these people Ã re putting a lot of time in without getting payed directly. But at the same time, it's not completely self-saccrifical because in the end they do have families dependent on them. Turns out these people are getting payed, if you expand your notion of capital.

  

In our getting economy, we focus on one kind of very scarcity based capital that induces a "getting" mindset because everything centeres around how to get financial capital. In a giving economy, we need to look at all the different forms of capital such as Social capital, Environmental capital, Intellectual Capital & Financial Capital and how they all keep eachother balanced. Let me make that a little more concrete as to how in the end these people are able to feed their families.

  

What ends up happening for people who start useful open source projects is they are obviously seen as the ones with the deepest knowledge on that technology. Their intellectual capital on this project is the highest in the market. As more and more companies & entities start to run & adopt the open source projects because of the value they generate (for free), they run into challenges that require deep understanding of the open source project. And that's how the people that gave their time to this project that was born from a giving mindset, get payed eventually. This is true for anyone who puts in the time to make meaningful contributions to the project. That means that this initial project is now creating value for exponentially more people as it would have if the initiator would have kept the code "protected" or waited for somebody to pay them to finally build this project.

  

Contrast this with patents. Patents are a more scarcity based mechanism set up to induce innovation as they are meant for the innovator who is granted the patent to recoup the time & money they put in researching the innovation. Here, one inventor or entity is empowered to guide the development of their invention for x amount of years. The actual impact the innovation can have depends on the ability of the entity behind it to coordinate its distribution and further development, significantly reducing the chance for actual impact at scale. The amount of people benefitting from this set up is drastically lower in the name of incentivising innovation.

  

You might say: Okay Tom but code & for inventing a new machine are not the same thing. The initial financial capital requirements are worlds apart. With code all you need is a computer for a car you need a factory?

  

Well, Tesla, who are now viewed as the most valuable carmaker in the world and are active in one of the most capital intensive industries in the world have opensourced all of their patents. Any established car maker or competing startup, can use them.

  

Why would Tesla do this? Again, it's to help other forms of capital flood in with the market they're creating. Tesla "gave something and now all carmakers have something because Tesla is trying to play the postivie sum game of establishing sustainable modes of transport. Before Tesla very few car manufacturers were making electric cars. Today, there's not one car manufacturer not working on their electric cars or electrifying their current line up. This is growing the overall market for electric cars, that Tesla currently is leading, again taking advantage of their bigger intellectual capital, social capital & positive environmental capital invested in this market. It is a way faster model to induce innovation as now the competition increases, more intellecutal, social, and financial capital flow into the Electirc Vehicle market which is a win for everybody.

  

The endresult difference between patents & open source movements is the difference between a wave helping a couple of boats escape low tide versus making sure you're lifting the tide with all boats. What I want to point out there is that the giving vs the getting economy are not perpendicular opposites. The giving economy is just an expanded view of the very narrow view that we've had in the 20th century of this rational homo economicus into the beautifully irrational, giving, caring beings that we are. A great framework that illustrates this very well is "doughnut economics", this is something we will go deeper on in a future episode as well.

  

So yes, open source is a beautiful example of the economy of giving - fundamentally demonstrating the difference between a scarcity vs an abundance based approach. Especially for us, as aspiring impact billionaires, open source & the giving economy mentality is for sure the way to go if we are to maximize impact - which does not mean there are no more uses for patents. I do believe that this can still be a worthwhile mechanism to incentivise certain innovation where that innovation in and of itself creates big impact. However the challenge again here is that its impact than largely depends on the innovators ability to distribute the innovation.

  

So I think we all get the idea now of what the impact of giving could look like concretely and how it's really shifting. And I think, to bring it all together, it comes down to this idea of moving from zero sum game, thinking to positive game thinking. And the way we can do that is by taking into account different forms of capital and not necessarily just looking at that one form of capital and trying to optimize for one form of capital, but realizing that if a market or a product is to create value, there needs to be a market created for it that can't just be dependent on financial dynamics. There are intellectual dynamics. There are social dynamics, all these different dynamics, that we today call "externalities" need to be embedded more centrally into our economic thinking. And if we do that, giving starts making the most sense from an individual perspective too. Because in the end, we all want to live happy, wealthy, balanced lives and money is just one aspect of that. And the idea here is that for the very first time in human history we have the technological capacity to create a contiously rising tide for all boats instead of just creating small waves here and there.

  

So what can you do to start adopting this giving economy mentatlity? A key question I like to ask myself in this light of the economy of giving & this abundance mindset is this: "How can I become the source of what I'm trying to get?" This means concretely that for example, when I'm feeling down instead of looking for someone to cheer me up with a compliment or a joke or some good news I text or call somebody just to give them a compliment. Because by giving we both get to get as opposed to just me getting. This is actually also one of the reasons I started The Impact Billionaires as I was looking for a community of big thinkers wanting to dive deep into what it takes to have big impact. So I try to became the source of that.

  

The great thing with that is that we have exponential tools at our fingertips that more often than not allow us to become the source of what we are trying to get, and if everybody starts playing that game we are supercharing our expanded economy views as an overwhelming positive sum game. If that's not big impact stuff, I don't know what is.

  

So the question I want to leave you with now is: How can you become the source of what you're trying to get?
