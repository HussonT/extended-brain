In this deep dive episode we're going to go a little deeper into the narrative that doughnut economics is bringing to the table & we're gonna try to come up with some ideas of how we can enable that narrative ourselves. We'll look at what Yonca is enabling this narrative with alternative financing & the impact shakers community where she's tackling Complex Societal Challenges Through Inclusive Entrepreneurship. After that, in part 2 to this episode - I'm going to share with you how I think the whole blockchain & crypto space could potentially change the game in favor of the doughnut economy.

  

Starting at the beginning, the concept of the doughnut economy. This is an absolutely brilliant book & model presented by Kate Raworth. Highly recommend the read - it's also written in a fun, understandable way which helps when you're talking about the economy - if you're not a reader, there's also a ted talk by her that explains the key concepts pretty greatly. However, let's listen to what Yonca had to say about the model:

  

//// CLAP ////

  

So as I was preparing for this episode, I was thinking how the heck am I going to bring across a model that is mainly visual over audio in a way that is relevant for you, the listener. Relevant in the sense of you'll know what to change tomorrow or do tomorrow to move a bit closer to having an impact. So I came up with 1. well letting yonca explain it pretty greatly in the previous episode lol - 2. telling you again to read the book & check out the model in a visual way. It is foundational for our 21st century thinking in my belief. and 3 - In the book, there's a brilliant bit that kate called scripting the play. In it she characterizes the main characters acting out our economy as they had been scripted by 20th century economical thinking. After that, she re-cast them for what it could/should be like in 21st century thinking. And I thought to myself, that's it. This is an easy to understand narrative that we can all understand and that we can get started thinking impact from.

  

My job then is to help you uncover impactful questions around that narrative that you will have to answer with your unique skill set and thinking. The main impactful question that I can come up with here is then simply: How can I, you, we enable that narrative? So keep that question in mind as I contrast the old and the new narrative and all of a sudden, that, for me at least, makes the model a lot more than a model for me - it becomes a well for creative thinking. So that is why in this episode, I am going to paraphrase bits of that "scripting the play" bit by Kate.

  

“In 1947, the year before Samuelson published his iconic Circular Flow diagram, a small laissez-faire band of wannabe economic scriptwriters—including Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Ludwig von Mises and Frank Knight—gathered in the Swiss resort of Mont Pèlerin to start drafting what they hoped would one day become the dominant economic story. Inspired by the pro-market writings of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, they established what they called a ‘neoliberal’ agenda. Its aim, they said, was to push back hard against the threat of state totalitarianism, which was spreading fast thanks to the growing reach of the Soviet Union. But that aim gradually morphed into a hard push for market fundamentalism, and the meaning of ‘neoliberal’ morphed along with it. What’s more, when Paul Samuelson’s diagram appeared—depicting which actors were at the heart of the economy and which were pushed into the wings—it provided the perfect setting for their play.  
Scriptwriting began in the late 1940s with the launch of the Mont Pelerin Society, which lives on to this day. But Friedman, Hayek and the other hopeful playwrights knew they might have to wait some decades before their play Institute of Economic Affairs in London. The big time came at last in 1980 when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan teamed up to bring the neoliberal script to the international stage. Both newly elected, they were surrounded by Mont Pelerin insiders: Reagan’s election team included more than 20 members of the Society, and Thatcher’s first Chancellor of the Exchequer, Geoffrey Howe, was a member too. Like the longest-running of Broadway shows, the neoliberal show has been playing ever since, powerfully framing the economic debate of the past 30 years. It is high time we met the cast of characters that star in its story, each accompanied here by a biographical note and a one-line character summary that—in true Shakespearean style—loads the plot from the get-go.”  

# Setting the scene

“Economics: The Twentieth-Century Neoliberal Story  
(in which we go to the brink of collapse)  

  
Staging by Paul Samuelson  
Script by the Mont Pelerin Society  

  
Cast, in order of appearance:  

  
THE MARKET, which is efficient—so give it free rein.  

  

As Adam Smith famously wrote, ‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.’ When the market’s invisible hand is set free to work its magic of allocative efficiency, it harnesses the self-interest of households and business to provide all the goods and jobs that are wanted.

  
BUSINESS, which is innovative—so let it lead.  

  

‘The business of business is business’, summed up Milton Friedman’s influential philosophy in the 1970s. Firms bring together labour and capital to produce novel goods and services and to maximise their profits. There is no need to look at what goes on in their factories and farms, so long as they play within the legal rules of the game.

  
FINANCE, which is infallible—so trust in its ways.  

Banks take people’s savings and dutifully turn them into profitable investments. Furthermore, according to Eugene Fama’s “influential ‘efficient-market hypothesis’ of 1970, the price of financial assets always fully reflects all relevant information. Hence, financial markets are ever adjusting but always ‘right’—and their smooth operation should not be distorted by regulation.

  
TRADE, which is win-win—so open your borders.  

David Ricardo’s nineteenth-century theory of comparative advantage demonstrates that countries should focus on what they are relatively good at doing and then trade: both parties will gain from it, no matter how unequal they are.10 Hence trade barriers should be dismantled because they only distort the efficient workings of the international market.

  
THE STATE, which is incompetent—so don’t let it meddle.  

When government tries to intervene in the market, it usually makes things worse, distorting incentives and picking white elephants instead of winners. If it tries to smooth the business cycle, Keynesian style, its timing will be off, and the market will pre-empt its effects.11 Beyond defending the nation’s borders and its citizens’ private property, it is quite simply best for the state to leave it to the market.  
  

Other characters not required on stage:

“THE HOUSEHOLD, which is domestic—so leave it to the women.

The household supplies labour and capital to the market, but there’s no need to lift the roof and ask what goes on within its four walls: wives and daughters kindly take care of domestic affairs and they belong in the home, as does this matter.

  
THE COMMONS, which are tragic—so sell them off.  

In the 1960s, Garrett Hardin described ‘the tragedy of the commons’ in which shared resources—such as grazing land and fish stocks—tend to be over-exploited by individual users and so are depleted for all.12 Managing such resources sustainably therefore calls for government regulation or, better still, private ownership.

  
SOCIETY, which is non-existent—so ignore it.  

‘There is no such thing as society,’ Margaret Thatcher famously declared in the 1980s. ‘There are individual men and women, and there are families.’13 And it is the market that connects them, as workers and as consumers.

  
EARTH, which is inexhaustible—so take all you want.  

There will be no shortage of Earth’s resources, claimed the laissez-faire economist Julian Simon in the 1980s, if markets are permitted to do their job. A shortage of, say, copper or oil will raise its price, spurring people to use it more sparingly, search for new sources and discover substitutes.14

  
POWER, which is irrelevant—so don’t mention it.  

The only economic power to be worried about, argued Friedman, is monopoly power granted by the state when it meddles in the market, and the distortionary power of trade unions. The single best way to combat it is (no surprise) free markets and free trade.15

  

It was, undeniably, a brilliant line-up—and almost a stitch-up. The market, promised the neoliberal script, is the road to freedom, and who could be against that? But putting blind faith in markets—while ignoring the living world, society and the runaway power of banks—has taken us to the brink of ecological, social and financial collapse. It is time for the neoliberal show to leave the stage: a very different story is emerging.”

  

  

Economics: The Twenty-First-Century Story

  
(in which we create a thriving balance)  

  
Staging and script: a work in progress by economic re-thinkers everywhere  
Cast in order of appearance:  

  
EARTH, which is life giving—so respect its boundaries  
SOCIETY, which is foundational—so nurture its connections  
THE ECONOMY, which is diverse—so support all of its systems  
THE HOUSEHOLD, which is core—so value its contribution  
THE MARKET, which is powerful—so embed it wisely  
THE COMMONS, which are creative—so unleash their potential  
THE STATE, which is essential—so make it accountable  
FINANCE, which is in service—so make it serve society  
BUSINESS, which is innovative—so give it purpose  
TRADE, which is double-edged—so make it fair  
POWER, which is pervasive—so check its abuse  

  

  

# The case for a new narrative: externalities

  

“To tell a new story, let’s start with a new picture of the whole economy. Samuelson drew his iconic diagram in the late 1940s—in the wake of the Great Depression and the Second World War—and so was understandably focused on the question of how to get income flowing around the economy again. No wonder his diagram defined the economy in terms of its monetary flows alone. In doing so, however, it offered an extremely small stage for economic thinking, along with a stripped-down cast of characters. So let’s start afresh with an economic question better suited to our own times: what do we depend upon to provision for our needs?”

  

And this is then where the idea of a doughnut economy clearly gets its merrits: an economy with an ecological ceiling & a humanitarian bottom. Again, can't stress this enough, If you want to dive deeper in the model I highly recommend the book - but for now I want to focus on a key idea that really made the need for a new narrative click for me, which is externalities.

  

The fact that we currenlty use the concept of externalities in our economical thinking for me is proof that our description of what a homo sapiens economy should be isn't even cutting it close - with devestating consequences. For the people who don't know what externalities are.

  

This is defined as a consequence of an industrial or commercial activity which affects other parties without this being reflected in market prices, such as a lot of the pollution that is required to keep industrial processes running or on a more postive note the pollination of surrounding crops by bees kept for honey. In both cases the only thing that gets counted in the economy is the thing that can be traded for actual dollars, euros, ... Which is a hopelesly narrow view. If your economy would be a good description of what we depeond on to provision our needs, we wouldn't be needing the patchwork of externalities & using ad hoc policies that differ from region to region to counter these.

  

To add to that narrow view is the concept that we've been using throuhgout 20th century economic thinking, which is that of the Homo economicus rational model man: this is the idea that a human being in an economy always has all the information and makes the most rational choice at all times which is assumed to be the most beneficial one for onseself. Turns out, we humans don't know everything and we certainly seem to be capable of being completely selfless - which again throws off this old narrative we've been repeating throughout the 20th century.

  

I hope you feel, just like me, that it is time for a new narrative. Kate thinks the same - so let me portray the picture she painted in her book for this new narrative in a very short way. And after that I'll give you some ideas as to how Yonca & I are thinking about brining that new narrative to life - we'll close of with some ideas on how you too can join in thinking about bringing this new narrative to life.

# Yonca's take on alternative financing

Now is this new Narrative the right one? The honest answer is that we're not sure. Does it make a whole lot more sense on a lot of levels? I would start nodding violently and shout "YES". So how can this Narrative be of service to you in your journey to impact? Well - one way to do it is ask yourself that exact question: Is this narrative the right one? If an instinctive yes or it's better than what we have today comes up - the follow up question is: How can I help bring this narrative to life? What does that mean for me? With my skill-set, my network and my ideas? Do I envision bigger impact? Then who do I need to become in order to have that impact - that's by the way the underlying question we're constantly asking here at The Impact Billionaires.

  

If the answer to the first question of "is this narrative the right one" is "I don't know" take the time to get informed - try to understand the impact of the current narrative - what characters are on stage and what are their intetions? Do I believe this results in a happy ending - really understanding the intentions of all the different "players" at stake.

  

If the resulting answer to the question is "no" then a simple follow up question is - what do you believe it should be then? Can you voice that opinion? Can you discuss it openly? Because we definitely need fresh thinking & new visions. If you have those ideas we invite you to write an article on The Impact Billionaires blog! So reach out if you have some ideas - we'd be happy to promote them for & with you. Healthy discourse & diversity in perspecitves is the way forward.

  

I found Yonca to be such an inspirational example of handling & enabling this new narrative and making it her own - in my eyes she's focussing on two distinct parts of the narrative and is setting up different structures/approaches in helping that new narrative come to life. The two parts of the narrative she's helping change is FINANCE, which is in service—so make it serve society & BUSINESS, which is innovative—so give it purpose. To freshen up your mind, the narrative in 20th century economic thinking came from: FINANCE, which is infallible—so trust in its ways. BUSINESS, which is innovative—so let it lead.

  

So what did Yonca do and what can you learn from it in your journey to impact? Let's first listen to what she had to say about the way she's looking at enabling alternative financing.

# ////Clap////

  

So what I love in Yonca's explenation is that she's taken the character "finacing" & looked at how does it relate to another character "business" and how can I make sure that the interaction between them lies more in line with the bigger ideas within the narrative - which comes back to that ecological ceiling & social floor. What she has found is that the classical way of financing business through venture capital is built on the fundamental premisse of perpetual growth - which is an assumption from the older narrative.

  

So there she spoke about amongst other things the ZEBRA movement which are businesses that are very clear about the role financing is going to play in the pursuit of their bigger goal. It is a movement of business that takes a stand in saying that the goal of a business is not to create (monetary) value for their shareholders but to create a broader set of value for all it's stakeholders. It is therefore no strange idea within the ZEBRA thinking to have as a formal exit strategy that says you will donate your business to the community.

  

So the ideas again, are brilliant - but then you have people like Yonca who roll up their sleeves and start tackling these things head on by for example creating a course around alternative financing. Helping founders understand different ways of funding their projects - other than the "classic" VC route. And that's the kind of thinking I believe we need from everybody to get this narrative from a concept to impact.

  

The other important clear axe that I see in Yonca's work, is the fact that she's looking to tap currently untapped wells by focusing on creating a more inclusive environemnt for people who would often benefit most from a change in the status quo - but because of it are kept right where they're at. If you had the reflex of like "yeah but I have no power to change anything" - really think again. Your power could lie in simply having a different view on the world. The Impact you have could as straight forwardly start with setting up a course (although Yonca might yell at me for saying that - becauase I know how much work she put in it.) If you had that doubt pop up in your head, highly encourage you to join Yonca's Impact shakers community. We'll help you get rid of that doubt...

  

This, in this whole undertaking of changing the narrative, is a key challenge. What is certain is we can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them - so leveling the playing field for different voices to come to the surface doesn't seem like a bad strategy at all. A true inspiration, Yonca.

  

What would be yours? What parts of the narrative would you focus on? Feel free to listen to the episode again and genuinly take a couple of minutes to think about it - you could change the course of the world just by thinking about it. Every huge things starts with that little idea.

  

In the spirit of keeping these deep dives short & insightful - and not overwhelming & lengthy - I am going to split this episode in two parts. In the next part I am going to dive deeper in ways that you can start enabling this narrative & the - in my view - massive opportunity that lies with blockchain & cryptocurrencies for this narrative to become true.

  

# Part 2

# My personal view on how we can implement this new narrative

  

Here's a couple of the ideas I'm thinking of from my persepctive that could help you get started in a thinking direction. Feel free to do with it what you will. To tell you the truth, I think about this way too often - in the car, in the shower, in bed, in the office so the ideas I have would be way too many to list up here in this deep dive episode - but I want to provide you with some thinking around what I believe to be a massive, if not the biggest opportunity to shift the larger economical narrative. And you guessed it, we're going to be talking about crypto - more importantly it's underlying technology. Blockchain.

  

Why do I believe it's such a fundamental opportunity: two big reasons. The role it could potentially fulfil as global decentralised trust mechanism in a first instance & the role it could play in making today's untangible forms of capital - such as environmental, social, intellectual, and so on a lot more tangible.

  

Let me explain the first point:

To help keep my thinking around the impact of these new technolgies clear, I try to really reduce them down to their core benefit - often that means these technologies are making something a whole lot cheaper & therefore more widely accessible. For computers that was computation. For AI that is prediction & for blockchain that is Trust.

# Why do I think crypto could play a crucial role in this new narrative?

  

# How can you bring this new narrative to life in your daily life?

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

All right so there's a lot we don't know so I'd like to do a couple of "first principle checks" of things we know for certain are true. I use "first principle checks" to break things down to their simples form that I feel, with my current world knowledge, to be true. I like to call these the vectors or axis that set up the space in which we're currently thinking.

1. Vector 1: Money makes the world go round - I think it's safe to assume that 99% percent of the world population relies on money to some extent go about their daily lives. That brings the potential for people impacted to 7billion ... Also explains why we've made it the center of our economy as per - !! that is, UP. UNTIL. NOW. right? Cause we're all going to switch to the doughnut economics model, right?
2. Vector 2: Money is a human invented thing. No one knows for sure who first invented money, but historians believe metal objects were first used as money as early as 5,000 B.C. Around 700 B.C., the Lydians became the first Western culture to make coins. Other countries and civilizations soon began to mint their own coins with specific values. SO, invented. In short it works because we've collectively, albeit unconciously decided it works.
3. Vector 3: In our modern world, money is used as a proxy of how we're doing and is sought to be maximalised - GDP being a clear example. Of course this is with a disregard of personal philosophies around money - but as long as policies are still being set with a main focus around GDP or assesements of world economies are still being made with a large focus on this metric - and for the sake of this thinking exercise, we can accept that money is used as a proxy of how we're doing.
4. Vector 4: Capitalism is an incentive structure. At it's core, an economy is a complex web of simple trades. These interactions need incentives to take place. Capitalism is a system that proposes a way to organize these incentives such that these interactions happen. Communism is another system that proposes a way to organize these incentives.

  

# Capitalism & its mismatch with the real world

Let's bottom up this thing for a second starting with that which in a time scale is a more recent idea we've introduced: Capitalism. The incentive structure that gave us much of our modern world. What's to like?? I think it's two main things: Channels our inherent greed to produce overarchingly beneficial results for a larger number of people than just us, provides a good "skin in the game" structure that helps us manage risk.

Since we've been running the whole capitalism thing in the west for quite a while now, we've optimized for this - being where we are today. It started with this simple idea of a free market & a focus on profit and boy did it create some world that in very many ways thrives for humans. As I heard Nassim Taleb recently say in a talk: "it is greed that recently lifted 1 billion people out of poverty - that is what gets them out of bed. It is not the NGO's that did that." So yeah, it works.

  

The current capitalist system also provides a good "skin in the game" structure. You need skin in the game for people to take calculated risks. But you need a balance, if nobody would take any risks we'd still be living in our caves getting scared at each sound we hear and if everybody would be taking risks without reporcussions chances are we'd have destroyed the planet by now - or just all have killed eachother.

  

Let's think back about what Yonca said. She spoke about the doughnut economic model - which in my view is a new proposal for one of these incentive structures. So if we take a deeper look at the proposal for this incentive structure within in capitalism we can say that capitalism is often thought of as an economic system in which private actors own and control property in accord with their interests. Here, demand and supply freely set prices in markets in a way that can serve the best interests of society. The essential feature of capitalism is the motive to make a profit. This implies an underlying condition of perpetual growth when it comes to an economy. This is where our mismatch with the "real world" starts.
