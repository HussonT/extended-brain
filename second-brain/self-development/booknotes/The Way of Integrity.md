## Key Concepts

### Gates to Hell
Martha Beck describes "gates to hell" as the topics we don't want to talk about - the things that terrify us most. For me, these gates are:
- **Cancer** - The fear of illness and mortality
- **Finances** - Money worries and financial insecurity
- **Giving up** - The fear of quitting or not persevering
- **Admitting defeat** - The vulnerability of acknowledging failure
