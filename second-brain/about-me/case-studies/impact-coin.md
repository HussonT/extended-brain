# Impact Coin Case Study

---

## Overview

**Company:** Impact Coin  
**Role:** Creator/Project Lead  
**Duration:** September 2017 - December 2018  
**Industry:** Social Innovation / Behavioral Economics  
**Team Size:** 3 students  

### One-Line Summary
Hacked social behavior at university by creating a cryptocurrency that incentivized students to lower classroom temperatures, with the coin's market cap tied to actual energy savings.

## The Challenge

### Context
KU Leuven, like many universities, faced significant energy costs from overheating buildings. Despite sustainability goals, behavioral change was difficult to achieve. Students complained about overheated classrooms but had no agency to change it. The university wanted to reduce costs and carbon footprint but lacked mechanisms to engage students in energy-saving behaviors.

### Problem Statement
How can we create a system that aligns individual incentives with collective environmental goals, making energy conservation rewarding rather than restrictive?

### Key Constraints
- No official university backing initially (guerrilla project)
- Need to work within existing building management systems
- Must be simple enough for mass adoption
- Zero budget for implementation

## My Approach

### Strategy
Create a gamified system using cryptocurrency concepts to make energy saving feel like a game with real rewards, leveraging social dynamics and economic incentives.

### Process
1. **Concept Development** (Month 1)
   - Studied behavioral economics and nudge theory
   - Researched university's energy consumption data
   - Designed token economics model

2. **Technical Implementation** (Months 2-3)
   - Built voting app for temperature adjustment
   - Created smart contract for Impact Coin distribution
   - Integrated with building management system (unofficially)

3. **Pilot Launch** (Months 4-6)
   - Launched in Computer Science building
   - Created viral marketing campaign on campus
   - Established "exchange rate" based on energy savings

4. **Scale & Iteration** (Months 7-12)
   - Expanded to 5 buildings across campus
   - Added leaderboards and social features
   - Negotiated with university for official recognition

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Make it a game rather than a mandate
- **Decision 2:** Tie token value directly to measurable energy savings
- **Decision 3:** Use peer pressure and social proof as adoption mechanisms

---

## The Solution

### Technical Implementation
- Mobile app for consensus-based temperature voting
- Blockchain-based token system for transparency
- Integration with building IoT systems
- Real-time energy savings dashboard

### Game Mechanics
1. Students vote to lower classroom temperature
2. When consensus reached (>70%), temperature lowered by 1°C
3. Participating voters receive Impact Coins
4. Coins can be redeemed for campus benefits
5. Total coin market cap = trimester energy savings

### Economic Model
- Supply limited by actual energy savings
- Value backed by university's cost savings
- Redemption for coffee, printing credits, event tickets
- Quarterly "dividends" based on total savings

---

## Results & Impact

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Adoption:** 2,000+ students participated
- **Energy Savings:** 15% reduction in heating costs
- **Engagement:** Average 10 votes per student per week
- **Financial Impact:** €50,000 saved per trimester
- **Carbon Reduction:** 100 tons CO2 prevented annually

### Qualitative Outcomes
- Changed campus culture around energy consumption
- Created template for behavioral change initiatives
- Demonstrated power of gamification in sustainability
- Inspired similar projects at other universities

### Business Impact
Proved that behavioral economics and gamification could drive real environmental and financial impact, leading to university adopting similar approaches for other initiatives.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Making sustainability fun rather than preachy
2. Transparent value creation (savings = rewards)
3. Leveraging social dynamics and peer pressure
4. Starting guerrilla-style to prove concept

### What I'd Do Differently
1. Get official buy-in earlier for faster scaling
2. Build more robust technical infrastructure
3. Create better documentation for replication
4. Include more buildings from the start

### Key Takeaways
Complex behavioral problems can be solved with simple, clever incentive design. The best way to change behavior is to make the desired action more rewarding than the status quo.
