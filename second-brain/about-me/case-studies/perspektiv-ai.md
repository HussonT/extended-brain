---

## Overview

**Company:** perspektiv.ai (Acquired by Cronos)

**Duration:** January 2018 - June 2020  
**Industry:** HR Tech / AI Talent Matching  
**Team Size:** 5 team members

## The Challenge

### Context
The internship market in Belgium was broken. Companies received hundreds of generic applications for each position, while talented students struggled to find opportunities that matched their skills and interests. Universities had limited industry connections, and smaller companies couldn't compete with big brands for talent. The traditional CV-and-cover-letter approach failed both sides.

### Problem Statement
How can we use AI to match students with internships based on actual fit rather than just CV keywords, while helping companies discover hidden talent they would normally overlook?

### Key Constraints
- Being 19 years old with no industry credibility
- Competing against established recruiting firms and job boards
- Limited capital (bootstrapped with student budget)
- Need to convince both universities and enterprises simultaneously

## My Approach

### Strategy
Build credibility through university partnerships first, then leverage that validation to approach enterprises. Focus on data-driven matching that provides measurable value.

### Process
1. **University Partnership Phase** (Months 1-3)
   - Partnered with KU Leuven to access student data
   - Offered free pilot to computer science department
   - Built initial matching algorithm using collaborative filtering

2. **Product Development Phase** (Months 3-6)
   - Developed ML model analyzing student projects, interests, and coursework
   - Created company culture assessment tool
   - Built two-sided marketplace platform

3. **Enterprise Sales Phase** (Months 6-12)
   - Pitched to HR departments with data-driven ROI model
   - Demonstrated 10x improvement in application quality
   - Landed Google Belgium as marquee client

4. **Scale & Exit Phase** (Months 12-30)
   - Expanded to other universities and cities
   - Achieved 95% successful placement rate
   - Negotiated acquisition by Cronos Group

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Start with universities for credibility before approaching companies
- **Decision 2:** Price based on successful placements ($250/match) rather than subscriptions
- **Decision 3:** Focus on quality of matches over quantity of applications

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Using university partnerships for initial credibility
2. Success-based pricing aligned incentives perfectly
3. Focusing on measurable ROI for enterprise clients
4. Building in public to attract talent and customers

### What I'd Do Differently
1. Raise capital earlier to accelerate growth
2. Expand internationally sooner
3. Build more robust data infrastructure from the start
4. Hire senior salespeople for enterprise deals

### Key Takeaways
Age is less important than solving a real problem with measurable results. Starting in a smaller market (Belgium) allowed for faster iteration and proof of concept before competing globally.
