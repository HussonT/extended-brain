## The Challenge

### Context
Galapagos, despite being at the forefront of biotech innovation, struggled with operational inefficiencies. Employees lacked visibility into end-to-end processes spanning multiple business units and IT systems. The company had attempted automation initiatives before, but without a structured approach, these efforts resulted in isolated solutions that didn't scale. With increasing pressure to reduce costs while maintaining quality and compliance in a highly regulated industry, they needed a comprehensive automation strategy.

### Problem Statement
How can Galapagos build a scalable automation capability that delivers immediate value while establishing the foundation for long-term intelligent automation maturity?

### Key Constraints
- Strict FDA and regulatory compliance requirements
- Complex global operations across 30+ countries
- Fragmented IT landscape with 200+ applications
- Limited internal automation expertise
- Need to maintain 100% accuracy in regulated processes
- Change fatigue from previous failed initiatives

## My Approach

### Strategy
Implement a dual-track approach: build strategic automation capability through a comprehensive playbook while demonstrating immediate value through a practical pilot project.

### Process

1. **Current State Assessment** (Week 1-2)
   - Analyzed existing automation initiatives
   - Mapped technology landscape
   - Assessed organizational readiness
   - Identified capability gaps
   - Reviewed regulatory requirements

2. **Automation Playbook Development** (Weeks 3-6)
   - Created standardized process intake methodology
   - Developed automation potential assessment framework
   - Built business case templates
   - Designed technology selection criteria
   - Established governance model

3. **Discovery Workshop & Ideation** (Week 7)
   - Conducted large-scale discovery workshop with 100+ employees
   - Launched online platform for continuous idea submission
   - Facilitated cross-functional brainstorming sessions
   - Prioritized opportunities based on value and feasibility

4. **Pilot Project Execution** (Weeks 8-12)
   - Selected invoice processing as pilot
   - Implemented intelligent document processing
   - Integrated with existing ERP systems
   - Demonstrated ROI within 4 weeks

5. **Roadmap & Scaling Plan** (Weeks 13-16)
   - Created 3-year automation roadmap
   - Defined capability building plan
   - Established Center of Excellence structure
   - Designed success metrics and KPIs

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Combine strategic planning with tactical execution
- **Decision 2:** Use invoice processing as universal pilot (relevant across all departments)
- **Decision 3:** Create online platform for democratized idea collection
- **Decision 4:** Focus on regulatory-compliant processes first

## Results & Impact

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Opportunity Pipeline:** 100+ processes identified for automation
- **Potential Savings:** $15M+ annual cost reduction opportunity
- **Pilot ROI:** 300% return within 6 months
- **Engagement:** 500+ employees contributed ideas
- **Speed:** 4-week pilot implementation

### Process Catalog Created
- 22 Finance processes
- 18 HR processes
- 25 Supply chain processes
- 15 Quality/Compliance processes
- 20 IT/Support processes

### Qualitative Outcomes
- Shifted mindset from "automation as threat" to "automation as enabler"
- Created culture of continuous improvement
- Established foundation for AI/ML adoption
- Improved employee satisfaction by eliminating mundane tasks
- Enhanced compliance through standardization

### Business Impact
Positioned the organization to achieve "next level of automation maturity," moving from scattered initiatives to coordinated, strategic automation program with clear governance and measurable outcomes.
