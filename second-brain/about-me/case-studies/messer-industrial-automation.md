# Messer Industrial Gases Digital Transformation Case Study

---

## Overview

**Company:** Messer Group  
**Client Type:** Industrial Gases Manufacturer  
**Duration:** 3 months  
**Industry:** Industrial Manufacturing / Chemicals  
**Operation Size:** 150+ production facilities globally  
**My Role:** Process Automation Consultant (via humain.ai)  
**Partner:** Roboest (Low-code Implementation)  

### One-Line Summary
Transformed manual whiteboard-based cylinder filling operations into digital automated workflow using Microsoft Power Platform, eliminating errors and creating real-time visibility across production and logistics.

## The Challenge

### Context
Messer, one of the world's largest privately-owned industrial gases companies, operated their cylinder filling facilities using methods that hadn't changed in decades. Team leaders manually downloaded SAP order lists each morning, transcribed them onto whiteboards, and assigned tasks verbally to operators. This process repeated across shifts, with no digital record of work completed, no visibility for downstream departments, and frequent errors leading to wrong cylinders being filled or orders being missed. In an industry where precision is critical and safety paramount, this manual approach was increasingly untenable.

### Problem Statement
How can we digitize and automate critical production workflows in a traditional manufacturing environment while ensuring adoption by operators who have worked with manual processes for decades?

### Key Constraints
- Workforce resistant to change (average tenure 15+ years)
- Safety-critical environment requiring zero errors
- Integration with legacy SAP system
- Multiple shifts requiring seamless handovers
- Need for real-time visibility across departments
- Limited IT resources at plant level

## My Approach

### Strategy
Use bottom-up discovery to identify pain points directly from operators, then implement user-friendly low-code solution that enhances rather than replaces familiar workflows.

### Process

1. **Value Discovery Workshops** (Week 1-2)
   - Conducted workshops with operators, team leaders, logistics
   - Shadowed full shift to understand actual workflows
   - Documented pain points and workarounds
   - Identified cylinder filling as critical bottleneck
   - Mapped interdepartmental dependencies

2. **Process Analysis** (Week 3)
   - Detailed time-motion study of filling operations
   - Analyzed error rates and root causes
   - Quantified impact of manual processes
   - Identified integration points with SAP
   - Assessed technology readiness

3. **Solution Design** (Weeks 4-5)
   - Designed intuitive drag-and-drop interface
   - Created automated SAP integration
   - Built real-time dashboard system
   - Developed shift handover mechanism
   - Planned phased rollout approach

4. **Prototype Development** (Weeks 6-8)
   - Built MVP using Microsoft Power Platform
   - Created automated order extraction from SAP
   - Developed task assignment interface
   - Implemented completion tracking
   - Built logistics visibility features

5. **Testing & Refinement** (Weeks 9-12)
   - Conducted user acceptance testing
   - Refined based on operator feedback
   - Stress-tested under peak loads
   - Trained super users
   - Prepared for full deployment

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Build solution that mirrors familiar whiteboard metaphor
- **Decision 2:** Use low-code platform for rapid iteration
- **Decision 3:** Automate data flow but keep human decision-making
- **Decision 4:** Prioritize user experience over feature richness

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Bottom-up discovery revealed true pain points
2. Familiar interface design drove adoption
3. Low-code platform enabled rapid iteration
4. Involving operators created ownership
5. Quick wins built momentum for expansion

### What I'd Do Differently
1. Include maintenance team earlier in planning
2. Build offline capability for system outages
3. Create mobile app version sooner
4. Implement predictive analytics from start
5. Establish KPI baselines before implementation

### Key Takeaways
Digital transformation in traditional manufacturing succeeds when technology adapts to people, not vice versa. The key is finding the balance between automation and human expertise, using technology to eliminate mundane tasks while empowering workers to focus on value-adding activities.
