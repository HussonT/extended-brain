## The Challenge

### Context
Bekaert, a global leader in steel wire transformation and coating technologies, recognized the critical need for intelligent automation to maintain competitive advantage. With operations spanning 45 countries and 28,000 employees, they faced the classic enterprise challenge: how to implement automation strategically without creating chaos. The risk of uncoordinated automation efforts leading to shadow IT, technical debt, and an unmanageable operating model was real and immediate.

### Problem Statement
How can a global manufacturing company implement automation at scale while empowering local teams, maintaining governance, and avoiding the pitfalls of uncontrolled citizen development?

### Key Constraints
- Diverse technological maturity across different regions
- Varying regulatory requirements across 45 countries
- Need to balance global standardization with local flexibility
- Risk of creating shadow IT through uncontrolled automation
- Limited automation expertise distributed globally

## My Approach

### Strategy
Create a hybrid model combining centralized governance with decentralized execution, empowering employees to become citizen developers while maintaining enterprise control and standards.

### Process

1. **Discovery & Assessment Phase** (Weeks 1-4)
   - Conducted workshops with stakeholders across regions
   - Assessed current automation maturity levels
   - Identified tech-savvy employees with automation potential
   - Mapped existing processes and automation opportunities

2. **Center of Excellence Design** (Weeks 5-8)
   - Defined ACoE structure and governance model
   - Created role definitions and responsibility matrices
   - Developed automation opportunity discovery processes
   - Designed escalation and support frameworks

3. **Automation Bible Creation** (Weeks 9-12)
   - Documented comprehensive automation guidelines
   - Created templates for business case development
   - Established technology selection criteria
   - Developed best practices and standards

4. **Pilot Implementation** (Weeks 13-20)
   - Tested methodology with South American branch
   - Initiated citizen development program
   - Built initial automation backlog
   - Refined processes based on pilot feedback

5. **Global Rollout Planning** (Weeks 21-24)
   - Created regional deployment roadmaps
   - Established training programs
   - Set up monitoring and success metrics
   - Prepared change management materials

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Adopt citizen development model to leverage local expertise
- **Decision 2:** Create "Automation Bible" as single source of truth
- **Decision 3:** Start with South America pilot before global rollout
- **Decision 4:** Focus on low-code platforms for accessibility

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Empowering local employees as citizen developers created buy-in
2. The "Automation Bible" provided clarity and consistency
3. Pilot approach allowed for refinement before global rollout
4. Focus on change management ensured adoption

### What I'd Do Differently
1. Involve IT earlier in the citizen development program design
2. Create more granular success metrics from the start
3. Build automation marketplace for sharing solutions sooner
4. Establish cross-regional collaboration forums earlier

### Key Takeaways
Large-scale automation transformation succeeds when you balance empowerment with governance. The key is creating frameworks that guide without constraining, enabling innovation while preventing chaos.
