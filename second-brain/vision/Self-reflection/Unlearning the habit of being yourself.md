# Reflecting on who I’ve been

## Questions to ask yourself

### What kind of person have I been?

I think until relatively recently I've been a pretty much an over-thinker. As long as I can remember really thinking a lot about how to do things, where to go. I guess like my dad always called me just an over-worrier and I guess I am. I guess a lot of my fears or things come from things in my head. Additionally I think I'm very creative, I love creating things.

On top of all of that, I think over the last 10 years I've been pretty guilt-driven. I often say things in terms of being calculated. When I'm on the phone with Scarlet, for example, I speak differently whether Priscilla is listening or not because I know that somebody's words can be used against me. So I try to anticipate that very often, which makes me emotionally responsible for other people - I edit what I'm saying.

### What type of person do I present to the world?

I think the type of person that I present to the world is: somebody who is very ambitious, smart, caring, loving, no-nonsense, and makes things happen.

### What is one side of my gap like?

I guess the gap kind of sits in how much I don't feel like I am actually getting things done vs. how much it looks like I'm getting things done. I think so far, all these other things (humane, etc.) have been relatively empty boxes - I haven't meaningfully shifted or changed people's lives. I am trying to project, so I think that's where there's a big gap in perception vs. reality.

### What kind of person am I really like inside?

I think inside I'm probably pretty lazy, I'm easily distractible, anxious (not super anxious), and not very formidable. Inside, I'm very caring. I think a lot about other people, but don't necessarily reach out to them often. I think a very continuous narrative that I have inside is that I'm a burden to people, that I'm annoying people, that people don't necessarily fully like me. I'm less than or better than people. I compare a lot.

### What is the other side of my gap like?

I think the other side of my gap is that it very much comes down to what I say I'm going to do vs. what I'm actually getting done. Lack of tangible, true impact and lack of courage maybe - I think I'm a lot less courageous inside than I am outside. Courage is definitely a focal point here.

### Is there a feeling that I experience, even struggle with, over and over again every day?

I think what I struggle with is doing the things that I say I'm going to do in the time frame that I say I'm going to do them. I also overcommit and underdeliver, and don't have a lot of clarity on what needs to get done. Because of that, I lack convincing power because I'm not entirely clear, or I keep rethinking, or I spend way too much time. I spend way too much time in Generals mode. So visions, strategies, and I should really reduce my strategy time. I think the way to do that is courage because the reason that I'm just so stuck in those visions is because I like the courage to act upon them - to share to send that the investor update to share the insight that I've had because in my mind it remains perfect.

### How would my closest friends and family describe me?

I think they would say: "Visionary dreamer, deeply cares, a bit stubborn or that can be dismissive focused on himself over indexing on big vision. I guess they would call me self-reliant, resourceful, intelligent, and curious.“

### Is there something about myself that I hide from others?

I guess I try to hide certain insecurities. I try to cover up for the lack of work that I'm actually doing. Some I use a lot of words to say not much and to actually not move things forward.

### What part of my personality do I need to work on improving?

Yeah, I think fermentability is just the courage to transfer potential energy into kinetic energy. Courage is just the central theme here.

### What is one thing I want to change about myself?

I wanna practice being more instantly courageous, just going for things without overthinking or overanalyzing them. Like right now with Julia, that's literally what's happening - I'm trying to wait for a perfect moment instead of creating one. So I guess courage is really about creating perfect moments more than it is co-creating them, because I do think you need to leave space for things to happen. But if I had that courage, I would've co-created a perfect moment and that whole night would've been a lot better.

# Choose an emotion

That is a big part of who you are, and that you want to memorize your chosen emotion. Maybe one that's not listed below. Remember that this word has meaning to you because it is a feeling that is familiar to you. It is one aspect of the self that you want to change. I recommend that you write down the emotion you came up with because she will be working with it throughout this and later steps.  
  
Examples of survival emotions:

## Choose a way of thinking

Become aware of how you think your state of mind when you are feeling the emotion you want to change. You may pick from the list below or add any that are not listed. Your selection will be based on the unwanted emotion you identified previously, but it's natural to be in one or more limiting states of mind relating to that emotion, so write down one or two that resonate with you because you'll work with these in upcoming steps.
