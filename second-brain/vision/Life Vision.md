## Who I want to be

**I am a impactful creator** - I shape & execute ideas, products, strategies people, teams, businesses & life. This makes me a source of endless enthusiasm, energy & excitement for the beauty of life & love. I am what they call a “formidable, joyful giant” who lives and stands by his values, purpose & the principles. I love deeply, fearlessly & passionately. In my committed love relationships, I am a protector, provider & guide - a fun, safe companion on this cosmic journey we call life. In my friendships I am a foundational friend who can hold space through loyalty for my friends to be nurtured, inspired, feel loved and admired so they can grow & evolve with my help. Most people that know of me use words such as inspiring, fun, wise & formidable to describe me. I have the emotional control of a playful monk who surfs his emotions rather than getting caught up in the wash. This allows me to be a platform & channel of joy, peace & leadership for many other people around me. The fact that I am so good at feeling good also means that I radiate good, loving energy which makes manifesting for me easy. I really know how to live life to the fullest, which make everyone that’s a passenger travelling on my cosmic journey excited to be a part of it. I make people around me dream, feel & do things they didn’t know they could. I’m the main character in my epic life story movie, fulfilling its cosmic duty of being the universe experiencing itself.

## Professional

I’m a craftsman who knows his shit. I deliver life changing products that unlock the highest form of human productivity. My power comes from an ability to create visions & stories that move people & bring them together. A root piece of identity I’ve hammered into myself is that of a formidable founder - which in essence means a founder that does what they say they’re gonna do, every time. I’m the go-to to go from no momentum to big momentum. On that journey of becoming a formidable founder, I am an eternal student that learns faster than 99% of the population. I relentlessly push 1-more, every time going the extra mile simply because it is a habit. I’ve focussed so much on learning the skills necessary to build something people want that it has become easy for me to do this. It’s also a big reason that I’m an inspiring leader who people love to follow - they feel safe, guided & excited for what’s on the other side of the path I’m co-creating with them. I’ve deeply internalised that winning is what you build on, and as an optimistic, enthusiastic builder I’ve built in all sorts of winning habits such as reviewing my wins at the end of each day, looking at the glass half-full every time & figuring out ways to stack wins. Joy & enthusiasms are my competitive advantages when it comes to building & attracting teams.
