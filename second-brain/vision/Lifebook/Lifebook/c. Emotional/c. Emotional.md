# ==Beliefs==

1. Emotions are the undercurrent of life  
    - They can add a whole lot of depth to life  
    
2. Emotions are intuition guides  
    - They let you know how aligned with your intuition you are, like a compass they can show you how far of your desired course you are  
    
3. Having emotional understanding is key in developing deep relationships  
    - A solid understanding of your emotions & your accompanying strategies channel them functions as a necessary solid foundation to build relationships on with your self & others  
    
4. Emotions, such as Joy, Love & Belonging, are the point of life & gain intensity when contrasted  
    - I do believe in the idea of no rain no rainbow but I also do believe in the agency you have on the judgement call - is rain bad? Doesn't have to be.  
    
5. It is possible to practice blisspline  
    - Kind of continues on the idea of point 4 in the sense that blissipline is replacing the question of "Why is this happening to me?" to "What is this trying to teach me?"  
    
6. Aligned thoughts & emotions spring from an integrity towards your intuition & being  
    - Every single time I've made a "shitty" decision, it was because I clearly ignored my intuition twinkle  
    
7. Emotions is how consciousness comes to life & there is an important hierachy that becomes a source of power (vs force)

# ==Vision==

I am able to feel deeply without letting my emotions control me. My emotions are my guides.

  

1. I am deeply in touch with my emotions & can amplify what my intuition is telling me through them  
    - I have literally perfected the art of taking 3 seconds to ask myself how I really feel about it and what my intuition is saying about it  
    
2. I am able to snap out of negative spirals easily  
    - I can read, spot & channel my emotions in such a way that this is easy for me to do  
    
3. I know how to cultivate happiness within myself  
    - By channeling my emotions I know what I need and when to continuously cultivate happiness within myself (or at least chose my emotional states)  
    
4. I have such high emotional intelligence that i am able to help people make sense of their own emotions  
    - This is one of the key things people appreciate about me and love being around me for  
    
5. I live life to the point of tears, abre  
    - As Albert Camus said, life should be lived to the point of tears. To me this means that you take all of it in - you experience all of it, never closed. Always open. Abre.  
    
6. I am not afraid to express or communicate my emotions in a confidently vulnerable way  
    - There's a lot more strength in confident vulnerability than in blind confidence  
    
7. I can cry  
    - Such a cathartic quality to just letting it all out, hitting a hard reset button.  
    
8. I am a master at channeling my emotions & have figured out my coping strategies in detail  
    - I know what I need when I need and make it a priority to find out & hold space to do or be the thing i need to do or be at that point.  
    
9. True power is rooted in experiencing higher level emotions.

  

> “Managing our emotions increases intuition and clarity. It helps us self-regulate our brain chemicals and internal hormones.It gives us natural highs, the real fountain of youth we've been searching for. It enables us to drink from elixirs locked within our cells,  
> just waiting for us to discover them.”  
>   
> -Doc Childre  

> “In the last decade or so, science has discovered a tremendous amount about the role emotions play in our lives. Researchers have found that even more than IQ, your emotional awareness and abilities to handle feelings will determine your success and happiness in all walks of life, including family relationships.”  
> - John Gottman, Ph.D.  

# ==Purpose==

1. Emotions are like energy waves that you can learn to surf.  
    - These can be super powerful.  
    
2. What's the point of life if not to experience it?  
    - Emotions are a clear path to depth in life.  
    
3. As it's the undercurrent of life, keeping it channeled & "in check" is a huge lever for the rest of your quality of life.  
    - It would be like trying to sail against the wind  
    
4. If I am able to communicate my emotions deeply & genuinely, my relationships will be deeper & more genuine  
    - It's a give & take kind of situation - you get out what you put in  
    
5. By having greater emotional intelligence, I can get better at helping people help themselves  
    - In turn again yielding satisfying, deep relationships  
    
6. It's the most direct, loudest & feel-able link with intuition I have  
    - Intuition as is is not very loud - emotions give me a set of more concrete feelings that help me understand my intuition better

# ==Strategy==

1. I will write daily reflections in my journal & review them weekly as pain + reflection = progress
2. I will make a list of energy gives & energy drainers & try to eliminate as much as possible energy drainers
3. Meditation daily is a must - don't skip weekends.
4. Create regular check ins with people you care about
5. Record strategies per emotion - evaluate what works & what doesn't → centralise in Notion
6. Make sure you have people you can talk to
7. Practice daily gratitude by messaging people
8. Also do end-of-day meditations before falling asleep
