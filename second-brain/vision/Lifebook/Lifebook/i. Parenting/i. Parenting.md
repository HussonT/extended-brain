> [!important] Guiding + Coaching + A shit ton of Unconditional Love = Solid Parenting

> “In every child who is born, under no matter what circumstances,  
> and of no matter what parents, the potentiality of the human race is born again: and in him, too, once more, and of each of us, our terrific responsibility toward human life; toward the utmost idea of goodness, of the horror of terror, and of God.”  
> –James Agee  

# ==Beliefs==

1. Guide  
    - As a parent you are a guide to a spiritual being of its own. You don't own your kids in any way shape or form. They look to you for guidance so that's what you should give. It's not about "raising" them it's about helping them raise themselves & help them navigate the world through what you've learned about it. But you get to learn just as much about the world through them as the other way around.  
    
2. Do > Say  
    - This spirtiual being learns from what you do more than from what you say  
    
3. First Lesson  
    - Your kid looks to you first to make sense of this world. Which can make it feel heavy as in "should I say this" or "Am I teaching the right lesson here?" - But I guess as long as I just keep asking those questions, I'm moving in the right direction. Also giving my kids the insight that they can question all the lessons they learn, even from me  
    
4. Fish > Give Fish  
    - A parent should help their kids develop the tools to think & work their way through life  
    Again, it's about teaching to fish not just giving the fish.  
    
5. Environment Designer  
    - A parent should understand & engage the needs of the child & help tho create the best of their ability an env in which the child can thrive. It is the most important job of a parent to work to create a safe environment for their kids. As a good guide does, he/she shield from true dangers & creates an environment for his guidees to explore in.

3. My greatest teachers  
    - My kids are my guides through life as well  
    
4. Boundaries

3. Listen to understand & empathically see things from their perspective
4. Make time to really enter their world  
    - keep track of the "little things". What did they name their dolls? Who's that one friend that did that one thing once at school?
