- [ ] **Figure out how to move up the consciousness ladder**
    
    - [ ] Can you reach courage? (reference to power vs force & the [counciousness](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6869b8ab-b480-4897-854f-6525d7b26cc9_3573x3195.jpeg) map)
    - [ ] Even better can you get into acceptance?
    
      
    
- [ ] **Are you tending to a distracting injury?**
    
    - [ ] Decide if distracting injuries are holding you back & is it taking away focus from the actual injuries & costing you time in your “golden hour” - the hour that truly matters.
    - [ ] are you neck deep stuck in a story for your past?
    - [ ] Cut away dead weight because there is a drop-dead time for all of us.
    - [ ] Are you using a “i’m only human excuse”
    
      
    
- [ ] **Repackage what you’re hearing, seeing & feeling for it to work for you into forward momentum**
    
    - [ ] Don’t waste a fucking thing - squeeze all the energy from everywhere - also/especially by flipping the negative energy
    - [ ] Record yourself whining/negative-self-talk & listen to it
    - [ ] Record & go deep into your deepest trauma: own that shit
    - [ ] The way we speak to ourselves in moments of doubt is everything → flip it to positive energy
    
      
    
- [ ] **Quit when it’s easy, not when it’s hard**
    
    - [ ] Many dreams die while suffering - there is no space for big-picture thinking in the heat of the battle
    - [ ] Make all your 1-second decisions beforehand - list all your reasons for not losing your shit when it gets hard?
    - [ ] Get ahead of your self-sabotaging impulses by mapping out what might go sideways/get really hard & decide you’re going to respond to that when you’re not in the heat of battle.
    - [ ] Be intentional, not reactive: Take a knee when the bullets are flying - take a breath & flash to your future - be fast & decisive
    
      
    
- [ ] **Make sure you’re not on autopilot**
    
    - [ ] Deal with your demons - is your wound lethal? Do you actually need help?
    - [ ] Where’s your self-esteem?
    - [ ] However scary it might be - don’t build walls, actively work take them down - one by one
    
      
    
- [ ] **Discipline is the only thing that will change your DNA**
    - [ ] FUCK PITY, ALWAYS - from yourself & others.
- [ ] Distribute your fusebox
- [ ] Check your foxhole
