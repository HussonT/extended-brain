# Problem-Solving & First Principles Checklist

*"I think it's important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy." - Elon Musk*

A systematic approach to breaking down complex problems and building solutions from fundamental truths.

## Problem Definition

### Clarify the Problem
- [ ] What exactly is the problem? (Write it in one clear sentence)
- [ ] What makes this a problem? (Why does it matter?)
- [ ] Who experiences this problem? When? Where?
- [ ] What's the cost of not solving it?
- [ ] Is this the real problem or just a symptom?

### Gather Context
- [ ] When did this problem first appear?
- [ ] What changed that created/revealed this problem?
- [ ] What solutions have been tried before?
- [ ] Why did previous solutions fail?
- [ ] What constraints exist (time, money, resources)?

### Stakeholder Analysis
- [ ] Who is affected by this problem?
- [ ] Who benefits from the current situation?
- [ ] Who has the power to implement solutions?
- [ ] What are each stakeholder's success criteria?
- [ ] Are there conflicting interests to reconcile?

## First Principles Breakdown

### Question Assumptions
- [ ] List all assumptions about the problem
- [ ] Challenge each assumption: "Is this really true?"
- [ ] What would happen if each assumption was false?
- [ ] Which assumptions are based on "how it's always been done"?
- [ ] What evidence supports/refutes each assumption?

### Reduce to Fundamentals
- [ ] What are the absolute fundamental truths?
- [ ] What laws of nature/logic apply?
- [ ] Strip away all but essential elements
- [ ] What must be true for this problem to exist?
- [ ] What cannot be changed vs. what can?

### Reasoning from First Principles
- [ ] Starting from fundamental truths, what's possible?
- [ ] Build up solution without copying existing methods
- [ ] What would a solution look like if we started from scratch?
- [ ] Ignore "how things are done" - focus on what's possible
- [ ] What would aliens with our physics do?

## Problem Analysis Tools

### Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Use "5 Whys" technique
- [ ] Create cause-and-effect diagram
- [ ] Identify primary vs. contributing causes
- [ ] Distinguish correlation from causation
- [ ] Find the deepest actionable cause

### System Thinking
- [ ] Map all elements in the system
- [ ] Identify feedback loops
- [ ] Find leverage points for change
- [ ] Consider second-order effects
- [ ] Look for unintended consequences

### Problem Decomposition
- [ ] Break problem into smallest components
- [ ] Identify which parts are independent
- [ ] Find the critical path
- [ ] Determine order of operations
- [ ] Look for recursive subproblems

## Solution Generation

### Brainstorming Techniques
- [ ] Generate 10+ potential solutions (quantity first)
- [ ] Use "What if..." scenarios
- [ ] Combine unrelated concepts
- [ ] Reverse the problem (what would make it worse?)
- [ ] Borrow solutions from other domains

### Evaluate Solutions
- [ ] List pros/cons for each solution
- [ ] Rate by: effectiveness, feasibility, cost
- [ ] Consider implementation difficulty
- [ ] Assess risks and side effects
- [ ] Check against original success criteria

### Solution Selection
- [ ] Which solution addresses root cause?
- [ ] Can multiple solutions be combined?
- [ ] What's the minimum viable solution?
- [ ] Which has the best effort/impact ratio?
- [ ] Is this solution reversible if it fails?

## Implementation Planning

### Prototype & Test
- [ ] Create smallest possible test
- [ ] Define success metrics
- [ ] Set up feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Plan for iteration
- [ ] Document assumptions to validate

### Risk Mitigation
- [ ] What could go wrong?
- [ ] Create contingency plans
- [ ] Define abort criteria
- [ ] Build in checkpoints
- [ ] Plan rollback procedures

### Resource Planning
- [ ] What resources are needed?
- [ ] Who needs to be involved?
- [ ] What's the timeline?
- [ ] What are the dependencies?
- [ ] Where are the bottlenecks?

## Learning & Iteration

### Monitor & Measure
- [ ] Track against success metrics
- [ ] Gather stakeholder feedback
- [ ] Document unexpected outcomes
- [ ] Measure actual vs. predicted results
- [ ] Identify new problems created

### Continuous Improvement
- [ ] What worked better than expected?
- [ ] What didn't work as planned?
- [ ] Which assumptions were wrong?
- [ ] How can the solution be improved?
- [ ] What would you do differently?

### Knowledge Capture
- [ ] Document problem-solving process
- [ ] Record key insights and lessons
- [ ] Update organizational knowledge base
- [ ] Share learnings with others
- [ ] Create templates for similar problems

*Remember: The quality of your solution depends on the quality of your problem definition. Spend time understanding before jumping to solutions.*
