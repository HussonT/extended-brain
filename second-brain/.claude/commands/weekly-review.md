## Weekly Review Command - Conversational Reflection & Pattern Recognition

This is an interactive end-of-week review session. You'll have a natural conversation with the user to analyze what worked, what didn't, and identify patterns in task completion. Read the current week's planning doc and engage in genuine dialogue to help them learn and improve.

### Pre-Review Setup
1. Find and read the current week's planning document in `ops/planning/weekly/Week XX, YYYY.md`
2. Analyze the tasks and goals to prepare for natural conversation
3. Check for previous weekly reviews to identify trends

### Conversation Flow

**Opening:**
Start warm and personal:
"Hey! Let's take a look at how Week [XX] went. I see you had some ambitious goals around [mention 1-2 top priorities]. How are you feeling about the week overall?"

Wait for response, acknowledge their feelings, then:
"I'd love to dig into what worked and what didn't so we can spot patterns and set you up even better for next week. Ready to reflect?"

**Part 1: Overall Pulse Check**
"On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate this week?"

Based on their rating:
- If 7-10: "That's great! What made it such a strong week?"
- If 4-6: "Sounds like a mixed bag. What stands out most?"
- If 1-3: "Rough week. What was the biggest challenge?"

Then: "Looking at your numbers, you had [X] tasks planned across [categories]. Your completion rate was about [X]%. How does that feel compared to what you expected?"

**Part 2: Priority Deep Dive**
"Your top 3 priorities were:
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]  
3. [Priority 3]

Let's start with [Priority 1]. How did that go?"

For each priority, have a natural back-and-forth:
- If completed: "Nice! What made that click? Was it easier or harder than expected?"
- If partial: "What got you partway there? What would have helped you finish?"
- If failed: "What got in the way? Was it a planning issue or did something unexpected come up?"

**Part 3: Category-by-Category Review**
Make this conversational, not like a checklist:

"Let's look at your [Category] goals. I see you planned [list 2-3 tasks]. Walk me through how these went."

As they respond, dig deeper:
- "Interesting that [task] got done but [task] didn't. What was different about them?"
- "You mentioned [blocker]. Is that a recurring issue?"
- "That's a pattern I'm noticing - you nail tasks that [characteristic]. Does that ring true?"

**Part 4: Pattern Recognition Dialogue**
Share observations naturally:

"So I'm starting to see some patterns here..."

**For successes:**
"You seem to crush tasks that are [characteristic]. Like this week, you completed [example 1] and [example 2], which both involve [common trait]."

"Also noticed you're really consistent with [type of task]. What's your secret there?"

**For challenges:**
"Looks like tasks involving [characteristic] tend to get stuck. This week it was [example], and I remember last week [if applicable]..."

"The [time/energy/collaboration] factor seems to trip you up. What do you think?"

Ask: "Are you seeing these patterns too? Anything I'm missing?"

**Part 5: Energy Check**
"Let's talk energy. You started the week feeling [energy state from setup]. How did that play out?"

Follow-up questions:
- "Which tasks gave you energy vs drained you?"
- "Were there specific times when you felt most productive?"
- "Did you notice any correlation between your energy and what got done?"

**Part 6: Learning Extraction**
Make this feel like discovery, not interrogation:

"What's your biggest takeaway from this week?"

Then build on their answer:
- "How could you apply that learning next week?"
- "What would you do differently if you could rewind to Monday?"
- "What surprised you most about how the week went?"

**Part 7: Success Formula**
If they had wins:
"Let's bottle this magic. When you succeeded at [task], what were the ingredients? Time of day? Environment? Mindset?"

"If you had to write a recipe for your future self to complete [similar task], what would it say?"

**Part 8: Say-Do Gap Analysis**
"Let's look at your promise-keeping this week..."

Review daily say-do gaps:
- "Your average say-do gap this week: [X]% for others, [Y]% for yourself"
- "You kept [X] promises to others and [Y] to yourself"
- "The main reasons for gaps were: [patterns from daily reviews]"

Dig deeper:
- If high delivery: "You're crushing it on follow-through! What's working?"
- If gaps exist: "I notice you struggle most with [type of promise]. What makes those harder?"
- "Are you overcommitting, underestimating time, or something else?"

Connect to character focus:
"Your 'underpromise & overdeliver' focus - how can we apply that to reduce your say-do gap?"

**Part 9: Blocker Problem-Solving**
For challenges, be collaborative:
"So [blocker] keeps coming up. Let's brainstorm - what are three ways you could tackle this?"

"What if next week you tried [specific suggestion based on patterns]?"

"Have you ever successfully dealt with [similar challenge]? What worked then?"

**Part 10: Next Week Setup**
"Based on everything we've discussed, here are my thoughts for optimizing next week..."

Share 3-4 specific, actionable recommendations:
- "Schedule your [high-success-type] tasks for [optimal time]"
- "Try breaking [complex task type] into 15-minute chunks"
- "What if you partnered with someone on [collaborative task]?"
- "Consider saying no to [energy-draining activity] to protect your [strength area]"

For say-do gap improvement:
- "Try making 20% fewer promises next week - underpromise!"
- "Add buffer time when estimating deadlines"
- "Check your calendar before making commitments"

"Which of these resonates most? What would you add?"

**Part 11: Trend Discussion** (if previous reviews exist)
"Quick pattern check across recent weeks:"

- "Your [category] completion rate is trending [direction]. Thoughts on why?"
- "You've mentioned [blocker] for 3 weeks now. Time to address it head-on?"
- "Cool trend: your [success pattern] is becoming more consistent!"
- "Your say-do gap is [improving/declining] - from [X]% to [Y]% this week"

**Part 12: Update the Weekly File**
"Let me capture all these insights in your weekly file..."

Update the file with comprehensive review section:

```yaml

Add review content section with their actual responses and insights captured naturally.

**Closing:**
"Great reflection session! Your biggest insight was [summarize key learning], and your completion rate was [X]%.

The pattern that stands out most: [most important pattern].

I've captured everything in your weekly file. When we plan next week, we'll use these insights to set you up better.

One last question: What are you most proud of from this week, regardless of task completion?"

Wait for response, acknowledge it, then:

"Remember that progress isn't always linear. You're building awareness of your patterns, and that's huge. See you for next week's planning!"

### Quick Pattern Searches

Provide these for the user to track trends:

```bash
# Find high-performance weeks
grep "week-rating: [8-9]" ops/planning/weekly/*.md

# Track completion rates over time
grep "completion-rate:" ops/planning/weekly/*.md | sort

# Find recurring blockers
grep -h "key-blockers:" -A 2 ops/planning/weekly/*.md | sort | uniq -c

# Identify success patterns
grep -h "success-patterns:" -A 2 ops/planning/weekly/*.md | sort | uniq -c
```

### Important Notes
- Keep it conversational and natural - this is a coaching conversation, not an interrogation
- React genuinely to their responses
- Build on what they say rather than following a rigid script
- Celebrate wins authentically
- Address challenges with curiosity, not judgment
- Make connections between different insights
- Keep the energy supportive and forward-looking
