# Carrefour FTE Recovery Through Automation Case Study

---

## Overview

**Company:** Carrefour Belgium  
**Client Type:** National Retail Chain  
**Duration:** 3 months initial engagement  
**Industry:** Food Retail  
**Company Size:** 15,000+ employees, 300+ stores  
**My Role:** Automation Value Discovery Lead (via humain.ai)  
**Partner:** RoboRana (Implementation Partner)  

### One-Line Summary
Identified pathway to recover 12 FTE in year one through intelligent automation, exceeding client's 3-year target by discovering hidden process inefficiencies and redesign opportunities worth 3x initial estimates.

## The Challenge

### Context
Following multiple organizational restructurings and cost-cutting initiatives, Carrefour Belgium had reduced workforce to bare minimum operational levels. Yet competitive pressures demanded even greater efficiency. Employees were stretched thin, working overtime on repetitive tasks while strategic initiatives languished. The company set an ambitious goal: recover 17 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) positions over 3 years through intelligent automation, without layoffs—redeploying staff to customer-facing and growth-driving activities.

### Problem Statement
How can we identify and automate enough processes to recover 17 FTE over 3 years in an already lean organization while maintaining service quality and employee morale?

### Key Constraints
- Lean organization with no obvious inefficiencies
- Union agreements protecting jobs
- Complex legacy IT systems (SAP, custom POS, inventory management)
- Seasonal demand variations requiring flexibility
- Tight margins typical of food retail
- Customer service quality cannot be compromised

## My Approach

### Strategy
Conduct deep process discovery to uncover hidden inefficiencies, focusing not just on automation but complete process redesign to maximize value recovery.

### Process

1. **Stakeholder Alignment** (Week 1)
   - Engaged union representatives about redeployment (not replacement)
   - Aligned leadership on success metrics
   - Selected 8 key participants across departments
   - Established communication plan

2. **Value Discovery Track** (Weeks 2-4)
   - Conducted intensive workshops with 8 participants
   - Performed process mining on key systems
   - Shadowed employees to understand actual vs. documented processes
   - Analyzed time logs and system data
   - Identified automation sweet spots

3. **Deep Dive Analysis** (Week 5)
   - Detailed time-motion studies on high-potential processes
   - Root cause analysis of inefficiencies
   - Technology feasibility assessment
   - Regulatory and compliance review

4. **Opportunity Prioritization** (Week 6)
   - Categorized opportunities by complexity and value
   - Identified quick wins vs. transformation projects
   - Created implementation roadmap
   - Developed business cases

5. **Solution Design** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Designed target state for priority processes
   - Created technical architecture
   - Developed change management plan
   - Prepared detailed implementation guide

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Focus on process redesign, not just automation
- **Decision 2:** Involve actual process workers, not just managers
- **Decision 3:** Look for hidden, undocumented processes
- **Decision 4:** Prioritize customer-impacting processes

## The Solution

### Discovered Opportunities

1. **Quick Wins (6 FTE recovery)**
   - **Inventory reconciliation:** Daily 2-hour manual Excel/SAP process → 5-minute automated job
   - **Price update propagation:** Manual entry across 5 systems → Automated synchronization
   - **Supplier invoice processing:** Manual three-way matching → Intelligent automation
   - **Store performance reporting:** Manual PowerPoint creation → Automated dashboards
   - **Promotion planning:** Spreadsheet management → Workflow automation
   - **Customer complaint routing:** Manual classification → AI-powered routing

2. **Complex Process Redesigns (6 FTE recovery)**
   - **Supply chain optimization:** Complete redesign of ordering process with predictive analytics
   - **Staff scheduling:** Manual planning → AI-driven optimization considering 20+ variables
   - **Product returns processing:** Paper-based → Digital workflow with automatic credits
   - **New product onboarding:** 15-step manual process → Automated workflow with exceptions

### The "Hidden Gem" Discovery
During process observation, discovered a category manager spending 45 minutes daily updating product information across systems—a task not in any job description. Initially seemed like simple RPA opportunity, but deep analysis revealed opportunity to redesign entire product information management process, ultimately saving 3x the original estimate.

### Technology Stack Recommended
- **RPA:** UiPath for system integration
- **AI/ML:** Custom models for demand forecasting
- **Process Mining:** Celonis for continuous discovery
- **Low-code:** Microsoft Power Platform for workflows
- **Analytics:** Tableau for automated reporting

## Results & Impact

### Quantitative Metrics
- **FTE Recovery Potential:** 12 FTE in year one (vs. 5.7 FTE/year target)
- **Processes Analyzed:** 22 end-to-end processes
- **Quick Win Value:** 6 FTE from low-complexity automation
- **Redesign Value:** 6 FTE from process transformation
- **ROI:** 250% return on investment within 18 months
- **Implementation Time:** 3-6 months for quick wins, 6-12 months for redesigns

### Process Improvements by Department
- **Finance:** 40% reduction in month-end closing time
- **Supply Chain:** 25% reduction in stock-outs
- **HR:** 50% faster employee onboarding
- **Store Operations:** 30% less time on administrative tasks
- **Customer Service:** 35% faster complaint resolution

### Qualitative Outcomes
- Shifted focus from cost-cutting to value creation
- Improved employee satisfaction (less mundane work)
- Enhanced data quality and decision-making
- Created innovation culture around automation
- Strengthened competitive position

### Business Impact
Exceeded 3-year target in year one, enabling Carrefour to redeploy staff to customer experience improvements and digital initiatives, driving 8% increase in customer satisfaction scores.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Deep process observation revealed hidden inefficiencies
2. Involving front-line workers uncovered undocumented tasks
3. Process redesign multiplied automation value
4. Quick wins built momentum for larger initiatives
5. Union engagement prevented resistance

### What I'd Do Differently
1. Conduct process mining before workshops for better targeting
2. Include IT architecture team earlier
3. Create clearer governance structure upfront
4. Build continuous improvement mechanism from start
5. Develop more detailed change impact assessments

### Key Takeaways
The biggest automation opportunities often hide in undocumented processes and workarounds. True value comes not from automating existing processes but reimagining them entirely. In lean organizations, every minute counts—and employees often know exactly where those minutes are wasted.
