## The Challenge

### Context
Telenet, Belgium's largest cable operator and leading provider of internet, telephony, and television services, identified workforce management as one of their six strategic pillars. With thousands of field technicians, customer service representatives, and retail staff serving over 3 million customers, even small improvements in workforce deployment could yield massive returns. The challenge: "putting the right person, in the right place, at the right time" in an industry where customer expectations for service speed and quality continue to rise.

### Problem Statement
How can AI and predictive analytics transform workforce management from reactive scheduling to proactive optimization, reducing costs while improving both customer satisfaction and employee experience?

### Key Constraints
- Complex union agreements limiting scheduling flexibility
- Seasonal and weather-driven demand variations
- Multi-skilled workforce with varying expertise levels
- Real-time service disruptions requiring immediate response
- Integration with legacy workforce management systems
- GDPR compliance for employee data usage

## My Approach

### Strategy
Use design thinking and AI opportunity mapping to identify high-impact use cases, creating a portfolio of experiments balancing quick wins with transformative initiatives.

### Process

1. **Context Discovery** (Weeks 1-3)
   - Conducted workshops with operations, HR, and field service teams
   - Analyzed 2 years of workforce data
   - Mapped current scheduling and deployment processes
   - Interviewed field technicians and dispatchers
   - Studied customer satisfaction correlation with workforce metrics

2. **AI Opportunity Identification** (Weeks 4-6)
   - Brainstormed 50+ potential AI applications
   - Evaluated technical feasibility
   - Assessed data availability and quality
   - Estimated business impact
   - Filtered to 11 high-potential experiments

3. **Experiment Design** (Weeks 7-10)
   - Created detailed experiment proposals
   - Defined success metrics and KPIs
   - Identified data requirements
   - Designed A/B testing frameworks
   - Built implementation roadmaps

4. **Prioritization & Planning** (Weeks 11-12)
   - Categorized experiments by effort vs. impact
   - Identified 3 quick wins for immediate start
   - Selected 4 strategic initiatives for long-term
   - Assigned digital innovation owners
   - Created governance structure

5. **Knowledge Transfer** (Weeks 13-16)
   - Trained internal team on AI methodologies
   - Established experiment tracking system
   - Created playbook for future AI initiatives
   - Set up continuous learning framework

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Focus on augmenting human decisions, not replacing workers
- **Decision 2:** Start with forecasting before moving to optimization
- **Decision 3:** Build on existing data rather than waiting for perfect data
- **Decision 4:** Create portfolio approach balancing risk and reward
