# Eden Protocol Case Study

---

## Overview

**Company:** Eden Protocol (Acquired)  
**Role:** CEO & Co-Founder  
**Duration:** July 2022 - April 2025  
**Industry:** AI/Web3 - Talent & Recruiting  
**Team Size:** 30+ volunteers, 3 core team members  

### One-Line Summary
Built an AI-powered recruiter for online communities, raising $500K with no VC network and scaling to 30+ volunteers who built the product for free before eventual acquisition.

## The Challenge

### Context
The shift to remote work and rise of online communities (Discord, Telegram, Slack) created a new paradigm where talent increasingly congregates in niche communities rather than traditional job boards. Companies struggle to identify and recruit from these communities, while community leaders lack tools to help their members find opportunities.

Web3/crypto projects particularly struggled with this, as their talent pools were scattered across hundreds of Discord servers and Telegram groups, making traditional recruiting nearly impossible.

### Problem Statement
How can we help companies tap into the talent within online communities while providing value back to those communities?

### Key Constraints
- No initial network in venture capital for fundraising
- Bootstrapping in a bear market (crypto winter 2022-2023)
- Need to build trust in skeptical Web3 communities
- Technical complexity of integrating with multiple platforms (Discord, Telegram, etc.)

## My Approach

### Strategy
Build a community-first product by recruiting volunteers from the very communities we aimed to serve, creating a product that was built by the community, for the community.

### Process
1. **Community Building Phase** (Months 1-3)
   - Recruited 30+ volunteers from Web3 communities to help build the product
   - Created a DAO-like structure where contributors earned equity
   - Built in public, sharing progress and getting feedback daily

2. **Product Development Phase** (Months 4-12)
   - Shipped 6 major product iterations based on community feedback
   - Integrated with Discord and Telegram APIs
   - Built AI matching algorithms for skill-based recruiting

3. **Fundraising Phase** (Months 6-9)
   - Raised $500K pre-seed with no prior VC connections
   - Leveraged community traction as social proof
   - Focused on strategic angels from Web3 ecosystem

4. **Partnership Phase** (Months 12-24)
   - Secured partnerships with major Web3 projects
   - Integrated with leading DAOs and online communities
   - Expanded from Web3 into broader tech communities

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Use volunteer model to build initial product, trading equity for contributions
- **Decision 2:** Focus on Web3 initially as a beachhead market despite the bear market
- **Decision 3:** Build in public to create community buy-in and feedback loops

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Building with the community rather than for them
2. Using volunteer model to extend runway and create buy-in
3. Focusing on a specific niche (Web3) before expanding

### What I'd Do Differently
1. Set clearer expectations with volunteers about timeline to equity
2. Raise more capital earlier to accelerate product development
3. Hire senior engineers sooner to improve code quality

### Key Takeaways
Community-driven development is powerful but requires exceptional communication and alignment. The volunteer model can work but needs clear structure and incentives from day one.
