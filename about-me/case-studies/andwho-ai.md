## Overview

**Company:** andwho.ai  
**Role:** Founder & CEO  
**Duration:** January 2025 - Present  
**Industry:** AI/SaaS - Personal CRM  
**Team Size:** Solo founder (for now)  

### One-Line Summary
Built and launched an AI chief of staff for personal networks, going from first customer discovery call to 50+ users with 5 paying customers in just 4 weeks.

## The Challenge

### Context
In an increasingly networked world, professionals struggle to maintain meaningful relationships with their growing networks. The average professional has 500+ connections but actively engages with less than 5% of them. Existing CRM tools are built for sales teams, not individuals, and social platforms are designed for broadcasting, not relationship nurturing.

### Problem Statement
How might we help busy professionals leverage AI to maintain and deepen their professional relationships without it feeling like work?

### Key Constraints
- Bootstrap/limited runway as a solo founder
- Competing against well-funded personal CRM startups
- Need to differentiate from both traditional CRMs and new AI assistants
- Privacy concerns around personal relationship data

## My Approach

### Strategy
Focus on speed to market with a narrow, high-value use case: helping users prepare for meetings and networking events by surfacing relevant context about the people they're about to meet.

### Process
1. **Discovery Phase** (Week 1)
   - Conducted 15+ customer discovery calls with potential users
   - Identified key pain points around meeting preparation
   - Validated willingness to pay for AI-powered insights

2. **MVP Development Phase** (Week 2-3)
   - Implemented state-of-the-art GraphRAG techniques for relationship mapping
   - Built core features: contact import, AI enrichment, meeting briefs
   - Created simple but effective UI using modern web stack

3. **Launch Phase** (Week 4)
   - Strategic outreach to early adopters in my network
   - Achieved 50% week-over-week growth through targeted outreach
   - Onboarded first paying customers with white-glove service

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Start with a narrow use case (meeting prep) rather than building a full CRM
- **Decision 2:** Implement GraphRAG for better relationship insights vs traditional RAG
- **Decision 3:** Price at premium ($49/month) to attract serious users and enable sustainable growth

## Lessons Learned

### What I'd Do Differently

2. Set up analytics infrastructure from day one
