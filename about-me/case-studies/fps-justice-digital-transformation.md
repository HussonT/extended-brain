## The Challenge

### Context
The Belgian Federal Public Service Justice, responsible for the country's entire justice system administration, was drowning in manual processes. With over 23,000 employees including judges, prosecutors, prison staff, and administrative personnel, their HR department managed recruitment through a maze of Excel spreadsheets. Each recruitment cycle involved multiple stakeholders, strict legal requirements, and complex approval chains that were increasingly impossible to manage manually.

### Problem Statement
How can we digitize and optimize critical HR processes in a highly regulated government environment while ensuring compliance, security, and adoption across a traditionally paper-based organization?

### Key Constraints
- Strict government procurement and security regulations
- Complex stakeholder landscape (unions, legal requirements, political oversight)
- Limited budget compared to private sector
- Resistance to change in traditional government culture
- Need for bilingual solution (French/Dutch)
- Integration with legacy government systems
