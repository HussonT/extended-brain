## Overview

**Company:** humain.ai (Acquired)  
**Role:** Founder & Managing Partner  
**Duration:** September 2019 - February 2022  
**Industry:** AI Consulting & Implementation  
**Team Size:** 10 team members  

### One-Line Summary
Built and scaled an AI consultancy from 0 to 10 people, closing 7-figure enterprise deals within 12 months by developing a unique implementation methodology focused on employee buy-in.

---

## The Challenge

### Context
In 2019, enterprises were eager to adopt AI but most initiatives failed due to poor implementation, lack of employee buy-in, and unrealistic expectations. Traditional consulting firms offered strategy without implementation, while tech vendors pushed tools without considering organizational readiness. The COVID-19 pandemic added complexity, requiring entirely remote delivery of transformation projects.

### Problem Statement
How can enterprises successfully implement AI and automation technologies in a way that creates real value while ensuring employee adoption rather than resistance?

### Key Constraints
- Starting with no brand recognition in a market dominated by Big 4 consultancies
- Launching just before COVID-19 disrupted all business operations
- Need to compete on value rather than price against established players
- Building trust with enterprise clients as a new firm

---

## My Approach

### Strategy
Differentiate through a unique implementation methodology that prioritized employee buy-in and rapid time-to-value, positioning ourselves as the "implementation partner" rather than just another strategy consultancy.

### Process
1. **Methodology Development Phase** (Months 1-3)
   - Created proprietary implementation framework focusing on change management
   - Developed "Employee-First AI" approach to reduce resistance
   - Built rapid prototyping process for quick wins

2. **Market Entry Phase** (Months 3-6)
   - Leveraged strategic partnerships for warm introductions
   - Focused on mid-market enterprises overlooked by Big 4
   - Offered pilot projects to prove value quickly

3. **Scale Phase** (Months 6-12)
   - Closed first 7-figure deal through partner referral
   - Expanded team from 0 to 10 during COVID lockdowns
   - Developed remote delivery capabilities

4. **Growth Phase** (Months 12-24)
   - Expanded service offerings to include RPA, process automation
   - Built recurring revenue through implementation support
   - Established partnerships with major tech vendors

### Key Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Focus on implementation rather than strategy to differentiate from Big 4
- **Decision 2:** Develop methodology emphasizing employee buy-in over pure technical excellence
- **Decision 3:** Use partnerships for distribution rather than direct sales initially
