# Growth goals

==1. 1M ARR in 1 year==

==This is the first hurdle to cross that will make all the others possible - without this none of the others work. There is no way I can launch a podcast being a failed founder, there is no way I can truly attract the mentors I want to attract being a failed founder, there is no way I can stay in the US being a failed founder, there is no way I can build up a community of the people that I really want to surround myself with being a failed founder - I’d lose importance in the eyes of people like Laurens which do not spend time with B-players. Also can’t provide for Scarlett if we do not go to the next leve.==

1. Recruit & grow a team that I absolutely love working with in 1 year
2. Build something that has clear impact outside of my own thinking in 1 year
3. Attract the attention of mentors I really look up to (Naval, Balaji, Mike Maples Jr., Founders of epic companies) in 3 years
4. Go on an epic retreat every 4 months in 3 years
5. ==Have a drilled in meditation & self-care practice in 1 year==
    1. ==This is clearly also an unlock for all the others. I’m learning that learning to control your impulses & emotions is really fucking key in getting work done easily & effectively. Having a drilled in meditation practice where you go deeper and deeper into your meditation and become unwavering about them is super duper key to making all the other things work.==
6. Never compromise on eating foods that I know aren’t good for me in 1 year
7. Attract a worthy mate in 3 years
8. Find total harmony with myself & the people around me in 3 years
9. Start doing a lot more talks in 1 year
10. ==Build up an audience in 1 year==
    
    ==Building up this audience is also an unlock to all the rest. I feel like distribution is so key to everything else and building up that audience by giving as much as I can is so important. Also this fills up my personal cup of contribution & growth - by sharing the lessons I learn daily I master them a lot better & get extra feedback while giving back to my community and growing the reach & ability to impact through that community.==
    
11. Launch my podcast on which I can invite amazing guests & people in 3 years
12. Find a community that i can grow & connect with for the next 5 years in 3 years

    1. ==This is such an unlock for the vision of my life that I have to be able to go surf over the weekend and to be able to invite friends to go on mini-adventures with me and explore & expand and live life to the fullest. I feel like travel & adventure has always been such a key part of my life that I can’t do without it.==
6. ==Have a hyper creative room 1 year==
    1. ==Having two rooms to be able to operate from where I belive very much in environemt design & so attaching certain habits to certain spaces I think is a way to hack your brain & body to accelerate into a state that you want to operate from on command. This is a baby step towards the mansion vision.==

9. Give Scarlett everything she wants 3 years

12. ==Have an amazing dinner room to host awesome dinners that will become famous 1 year==
    1. ==Hosting dinners has been on my list for a while & this is literally the way I love connecting with people most is through curated conversation so doing this in a way where I get to set the tone is literally the best way for me to contribute & grow as I help other people expand their perspective + I get to expand my own + I get to fill my social cup of connecting deeply with people rather than superficially.==

2. ==Raise a new round that would put my personal net worth at around 5M==
