As kids we adopt one of four roles when we crave belonging and love:

  

1. Get sick  
    - demand care  
    
2. Become an achiever  
    - we try to be brilliant to become indispensable  
    
3. Become a carer  
    - okay I’m not getting love ill just give everyone what i want  
    
4. Become a rebel  
    - I’ll demand attention  
    

  

You don’t earn, buy, work for, coerce or beg or plead for love

> You don’t earn, buy, work for, coerce or beg or plead for love

  

What part do you want to take up? - can you let go of those above?
