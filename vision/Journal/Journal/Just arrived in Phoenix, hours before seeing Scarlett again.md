This period has been strange - between having seen Scarlett in November & now there’s a whole lot in my attitude that has changed.

Before I believed that:

1. I needed to be in the US asap, or I was not going to fulfil the role of dad as I thought was the only way to fully be a dad - which was by being present.
2. That meant that I constantly lived with this feeling of “I’m gonna be in the US in 6 months so what’s the point of connecting with anybody or anything over here”.
3. I constantly felt that I was lacking in all areas of my life, there was not one area where I felled I was being “pulled” - it was all my drive to achieve & satisfy this idea of who I should be that yanked me forward.

Then, a moment of clarity happened. When Pricela was here, I realised that even if I would give up everything I had built but worked so hard to not attach myself to - it would not be for a right reason. It would not be built on a coherent premise. And that premise was that I would be able to take my place as me here in the US to be the dad that I thought I should be to Scarlett. But I realised how much I change when Pricela is in charge, and I don’t mean that in “anger” towards her - it’s just that in this setup, she has defacto all the power when it comes to making key decisions such as whether to not stay or stay in Tucson. Like what am I gonna do? Kidnap them? sounds a bit toxic no?

  

So that was the moment that that premise of “If I want to be a good dad → I have to move to the US to be closer to Scarlett no matter what → I have to give up everything I have built up here” kinda fell apart. Because what does it mean to be a good dad in this situation? What am I teaching Scarlett? That giving up your own life’s-purpose, drive & sense of duty is worth giving up for one person? No, I believe that as a parent you’re a guide. And that means in the first place laying the land for what’s possible. I grew up seeing my dad 12-24 times a year - a weekend every month/2weeks. Still I have learned so much from him with the businesses he’s built, the house he’s built & the wife he’s found and learned to love so deeply and I love him to bits, not for what he did for me - but for who he is. So that view of what it means to be a good dad, for me, was crooked. It was centered on doing & not being. I realised that if I do this - move to Tucson under the “rule” of Pricela - I would not make a move to be my best self. And the hard part of that is that I can be the only judge of that. So I have to be so convinced of this that the view and opinions of others can’t impact the clarity of vision & the reasons for me of why I believe that and of why I believe in the end that is truly the best scenario for everyone, Scarlett in the first place. And that’s hard. Because there’s no manual here. Maybe I am making the wrong choice. But at some point, you have to decide and commit & have the courage to be who you are and pay the short term price for that.

  

So now I believe more empowering things:

1. Love knows no boundaries. Sure, I won’t be the typical, super present dad. But I’ll be the dad that opens her mind to the possibilities of life. That helps her experience the world by spending a summer in different countries every year.
2. I focus on what’s in front of me and work to maximise the impact of that against a longterm vision. There’s no should’s, only musts’s & could’s
3. I want to live a life where I’m pulled by virtues & values, not pushed by visions that aren’t even fully my own.
