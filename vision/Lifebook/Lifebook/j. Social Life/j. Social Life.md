# ==Beliefs==

1. Who?  
    - I believe that choosing friends wisely is a key to success.  
    
2. Be intentional  
    - Great friendships require investments. Not so great ones feel like evenings spent.  
    
3. Bound  
    - Family truly is a special bond, because in a way you're "stuck" with eachother so these relationships by default can handle a whole lot more strain but are therefore often deeper.  
    
4. Unlock  
    - Great friends unlock parts of yourself in the best way possible, they push you but also simply inspire you simply by who they are.  
    
5. Who are your 5?  
    - You are the sum of the 5 people you spent most time with  
    
6. Quality > Quantity  
    - I believe I can have very deep friendships with many people  
    
7. Be the source  
    - The way to make a true friend is to be one. Your vibe attracts your tribe. I believe you can attract the people you're looking for by being open about who you are.

    - Ski, jungle, city, all of it  
    
4. Seek out mentors

6. Do an "alliday"
7. Reach out to people I find inspiring on a bi weekly basis

8. Really create intentional time to connect deeply  
    - At least once a week with one friend  
    
9. Find & create a tribe  
    - Go go go
