# ==Beliefs==

1. Love flows  
    - You don’t earn, buy, work for, coerce or beg or plead for love. What I seek is seeking me. Like a great wave, you don't negotiate with it. Either you're in the perfect position to catch it and everything has aligned for you to actually get it (you get up at the right time, there's no one else on the wave closer to the breaking point, ...) or you're not.  
    
2. Extraordinary people  
    - A great relationship requires extraordinary people. I won't settle for a relationship just to have a relationship. I believe that my willingness to be alone is directly proportional to how right, inspiring & epic this person is to me  
    
3. There is somebody extraordinary out there that wants me & wants to build a life with me  
    - See point 1 + I know she's out there. We just have to find each other.  
    
4. A great relationship is built on wants and not needs  
    - Neediness is just not a good place to start anything from. Start by giving. That is what you do whenever you want anything in life. Whether it's a new car a new home or new friends. Start by giving.  
    
5. Fear is a lousy guide when it comes to love  
    - No fear based decisions are good decisions when it comes to a love relationship  
    
6. A great love relationship functions as your mothership  
    - It's something you can come back to in this "stormy" world  
    
7. If you're looking for a needle in a haystack, use a magnet  
    - Finding the right person is hard, attracting them is not: focus on attracting them

> There is only one science, love; only one riches, love; only one policy, love;  
> To make love is all the law, and the prophets.”  
> **–Anatole France**

# ==Vision==

1. Unshakable team  
    - we understand each other at the the deepest level and are there for each other in ways no-one else is  
    
2. Deeply Empathic  
    - In our relationship we are highly sensitive to each-other's wants in all aspects of life & make sure we do everything to help each-other get there as well as help each other understand ourselves while also understanding each other.  
    
3. Warmth, Safety & "Homely"  
    - My love relationship feels like a cosy Christmas night or a beautiful oceanside sunset  
    
4. Fun, Adventure & Love are central  
    - Our Love relationship is a way to consistently make our vision bigger, not smaller. We see only ways in obstacles & we don't let society (job, family, friends, ...) dictate how we should or shouldn't live our lives. If we want to go live in another country for 6 months, than that's what we'll do.  
    
5. Mutuals  
    - Our love relationship is built on deep admiration & respect towards each-other. We have a common habit of ferocity & a common drive to grow  
    
6. Growth  
    - Our mutual growth is a key point in our relationship where we create time to intentionally help each other grow

> –D.H. Lawrence  

> “A life's worth, the end isn't measured in hours, or dollars. It's measured by the amount of love exchanged along the way.”  
> –Douglas C. Means  

# ==Purpose==

1. (Almost) everything is better when experienced together  
    - Especially with the right people. The opposite is true also however, the wrong people can make everything worse. Extra reason to have a clear view on who it is you're wanting to attract.  
    
2. What's the point of life if you can't have somebody mean the world to you & the other way around  
    - Seriously. I have been in love a couple of times. Best thing ever. Also to have somebody to build with no matter what. Powerful stuff.  
    
3. Love is the ultimate life source  
    - In the act of creating, love is always, always involved.  
    
4. Deep connection is an incredible way to give  
    - The deeper you go with somebody, the more you have to offer at the levels that truely deeply matter.  
    
5. Life is rocky. I want a homebase  
    - someone I can rest & recharge with just at the thought of her  
    
6. I want to build an epic family as a service to the universe (and my own life experience)  
    - Just think of what Elon Musk's family's going to mean to the world in the century's to come.  
    
7. Together = Exponential = Expansion  
    - I believe the meaning of life is to experience as much of it as possible. If you do that together, by default you get to experience a whole bunch more.  
    
8. It's just a gateway to so much fun, passion, excitement, care, love & depth of life  
    - WHO TF DOES NOT WANT TO BE MADLY IN LOVE????????

# ==Strategy==

1. Make it a point to get yourself out there - meet people, could be anywhere
2. Commit to reading, learning about love & dating.
3. Keep your driving motivation in check: Want or need?
4. Articulate very clearly but non-restrictively what you want & then become that.
5. How can I create the ideal scenario's for meeting her?
6. Become the person that would attract that person
7. Describe who she is so you know who to attract
