# ==The power of a poem==

Time. We only get so much of it in this life. Time clearly is one of those immutable laws that can govern the way a life is lived. The awe-some thing about the kind of living us Humans get to do, is that we get to ==interpret these laws.== We get to do so through perception and awareness. That gives us power - power over what it means to us to live a life in a way that it is well-lived.

  

The first part is perception. Just like a good poem has a different meaning to anyone reading it - because of their previous experiences, their beliefs, the point where they're at at that moment in their life, their hopes and aspirations - what they wish to be true, what they long for, in short what makes them, them - so too do we get to write, interpret and resonate with life from our own field of perception.

  

The greatest poems are those that touch upon a great truth in ourselves. They summon a whole world that goes beyond the words on the page. Our world. A world that feels familiar yet we've never been to that part of it. Very much like discovering a new part of a city in the city that you've been living in for the past years. To me, that part is awareness. Connectedness to a bigger vision, a bigger play - a higher meaning.

  

Yes, a good poem has a different meaning for anyone reading it - but there is still a consciously expressed base to return to. A harbour in the storm. A clear path in acceleration. Some shade on the hottest day. Common ground. That's all we get to work with on the page. That's all you can expect from the pages in this lifebook. Or put in another way, all is what you get to work with through perception & awareness. The pages that follow are only to be catalysts. Just like a good poem summons worlds beyond even what we can consciously comprehend, so too should the pages that I help you write here.

  

This life-book is the poem of this life. A conscious attempt to touch upon some of our deep truths - past, present & future - I did start this with the word Time, didn't I 😉. And like with any good poem, most of it's magic is read in between the lines - so too is this lifebook but a sketch of these truths to be filled in through life-filled days. It is to also be that harbour, a place to come to rest, reset & re-evaluate. But even more so it is to function as a pull forward - a direction to acceleration. Instead of just writing what I mean, let me just show you. With a poem, of course 😉

# The foundations of a great poem

## ==Premise - what do you believe?==

Everything starts with what you believe. All of it. That's why meditation is such a life hack - as it allows you to monitor what you believe in real time & then adapt or not as you go. The interesting thing about the human experience is that we all live in an absolute reality but are not (always) able to fully grasp that absolute reality. The delta between our absolute & relative realties leaves space for us to choose our beliefs - or a lot of them at least. So might as well make them empowering, right?

  

> what you believe, you receive

  

- Your Premise refers to the foundational beliefs you hold about this category. What do you believe? What deeply held beliefs are shaping your life?
- Are your beliefs empowering? Do they move you at a deep level or are they holding you back? The premise is your core belief about a Lifebook Category that sets the tone and serves as a platform for all your actions related to that category. In other words, a Premise is a foundational belief upon which other beliefs are based.

  

> When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be  
> - Lao Tzu  

## ==Vision - what do you want?==

Imagine you're a sculptor. You have a big block of marble in front of you. 20 people pass by your studio, and you're not yet sure what you're going to turn the marble into. All 20 give you a different idea. One says a dolphin, the other says a naked lady, etc. You think to yourself okay, let's go with dolphin. Then you start chipping, it doesn't yet look like a dolphin so one of your really good friends comes along and says - make it a naked lady. I love naked ladies... So you say, well I guess I can still do that. But now you have to read up on how to create a naked lady, ...

  

If from the get go you would've been clear on the vision of the naked lady, those 21 people passing by could've given you specific feedback on what you're trying to accomplish, instead of just general ideas due to amongst other things the utility of the feedback you get against your vision.

> [!important] The speed of you being able to achieve your vision is directly proportional to the clarity of your vision.

> To the person who does not know where he wants to go there is no favorable wind.  
> — Seneca  

  

- Your Vision refers to the ideal state you would like to achieve in this important category. Ask yourself: How do you want this area of your life to feel? What do you want it to look like? What do you want to be doing on a consistent basis?
- If your life were exactly how you wanted it to be in that category, what would it consist of? When you’re creating your Vision for a Lifebook category, don’t be afraid to set the bar high. Dream big in this section.

  

Without a clear life vision, an extraordinary life is pretty much impossible → you require context to make judgement calls (which extraordinary is). Sure you can choose to not want anything and there is a big argument to be made for this - there's for sure a balance to strike, but in the end envision our brightest future & building for it is what we as human beings do best.

  

It is crucial you give yourself permission to ask for what you really want - this part is where you choose to either set limits or not on yourself.

  

Visioning for sure is the "art" part of life, it is then another art to figure out how much science you need to make your visions come to life. Before you do that, you need some larger frame of reference, which leads us seamlessly into the purpose part

## ==Purpose - why do you want it?==

  

> A person all wrapped up in themselves makes for a mighty small package.  
> - Michael Beckwith  

  

I often think in impact vectors. Purpose to me are the big vectors that create your vector span in life. The level of consciousness you are able to attain is directly proportional to the dimension of the vector space that you are able to live in. At this moment I believe there are 4 levels of consciousness which allows for 4 vectors to combine into a space - there's prob more but this is a pretty fresh thought so while looking back at this again later, feel free to update, future self ;)

  

Taken from Beckwith's framework for consciousness the 4 levels of consciousness are:

- To me - Victim-conciousness
- By me - Manifester-conciousness
- Thru me - Channeller-conciousness
- As me - Being-conciousness

  

It is within those levels of consciousness that I believe i get to set up impact or purpose vectors. These purpose vectors obviously change as you move up in consciousness - so it is in this section of our life poems that I describe the underlying currents that shape & interact with all the other parts of this poem. This is the part that makes all the other sections encompass way more than what their words by themselves do.

  

A purpose is literally about defining a space so much larger than the "self" - it's here that you decide to either be the wind giving direction to millions of little blades of grass or the single blade of grass. Nothing wrong with either, but I know which one I want. This decision affects all the other undercurrents in our poem.

## ==Strategy - what can you do to achieve it?==

This is the science part - these are like the words on the page that crystallise the concepts & currents flowing under the poem. These are the "off this world" things needed that translate the inner realm into the outer realm.

  

The strategy part is where I come up with the plans, concrete goals, best practices, habits, "processes" to arrive at the actual goals that are born from the previous three parts. This is where suggestions for the how live. This is also the one that requires the most flexibility.

  

It is important here as well that you take into account your comfort zone and plant clear flags outside of it.

  

> If you do what you can, you'll never be more than what you are

  

And with all that, now that the vectors are set out, let's start filling up this vector space with clarity so we can consciously choose joy.

  

> Create Clarity, Choose Joy.
