> [!important] A character is forged through values, priroities & choices

  

**A Declaration of who I am:**

I am a founder learning the ways of big-value-creation: this means meaningful connections, personal-growth, fun & meaningful connections are among my top values. This also means that **I push the limits** & expect the highest standard in every aspect of life. In the aspect of love. In the aspects of friendship. In the aspect of material wealth. In the aspect of what people think is possible. In the aspect of creating a community around what I do. In the aspect of growth & learning. I am demanding from the people who join me on this mission but not demeaning. I have an ability to push people beyond what they believe they are capable of.

I am full of emotion yet am able to manage them with grace. I take initiative. I am not afraid of rejection. I know that whenever I’m not failing at half the things I’m trying, I’m not being ambitious enough. When I speak, people listen. My presence alone inspires a form of reverance & awe from the people around me. I ooze energy. I am able to build a network with depth of connection. I swear by the entrepreneurial way & believe everything is “figureoutable”. My visions for every aspect of my life keep expanding as does my ability to execute on them. I have high respect for driven people - it is hard for me to spend time or respect people that do not have this drive to do something.

# ==Beliefs==

### Primary Beliefs (max 3)

3. **Character shows most clearly in decisions & choices:** Character is willed into existence through a set of values + decisions & choices consistently made according to those values.

### Secondary beliefs

1. Everything else flows from your character, these are the most powerful, actionable rudders that will steer you towards the life you’ll end up living.
2. Who you are determines your world  
    - It's the fast track to getting everything you want. This is where you get to train both perception & awareness.

    - Which is just as important
