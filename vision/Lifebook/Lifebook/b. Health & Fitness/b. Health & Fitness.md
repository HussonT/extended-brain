# ==Beliefs==

1. My health is the most important thing in my life  
    - if I don't have energy or health, I can't do anything, it's really that simple  
    
2. My habits here determine both my short & long term destiny  
    - just ask the belly ache I have 20 minutes after eating ice-cream  
    
3. I believe my health is 65% determined by what I eat & 35% movement  
    - and when it comes to food → focus no getting the good stuff in rather than avoiding the bad stuff  
    
4. Consistency & intensity are more important than endurance  
    - There's no point in doing one long run every 5 years  
    
5. My body knows what it needs and communicates that to me clearly  
    - whether it's a belly ache or feeling tired or feeling restless  
    
6. Rest is as important as the exercise itself  
    - the rhythm of life is give and take, up and down, in and out  
    
7. Working out gives energy & creates a clear mind  
    - this really doesn't need a side-note lol  
    
8. Eating right gives energy & creates a clear mind  
    - cfr supra  
    
9. Looking out for my health is fun as the return is exponential  
    - try doing your best work after a McDo at noon - exactly  
    
10. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle requires a set of habits & a little self-discipline  
    - once the system is in place, just run it for ex how easy is the week when we've meal-prepped on Sunday

# ==Vision==

When it comes to health & fitness, I've figured out a way to make them my default setting. For all the things I want to do - I bring A+++ -player energy⚡️.

  

1. I have endless energy  
    - i'm always game, always ready to tackle any mental or physical challenge  
    
2. I radiate energy visually  
    - I have a very muscular, energetic body which makes all my movements look and feel strong & full of energy  
    
3. Eating healthy is easy for me  
    - I have dialed in systems & habits that help me eat healthy as my easiest default  
    
4. I love my body  
    - which makes me feel confident in all situations, I'm never embarrassed or shy about showing of my body (from taking of a sweater and showing my belly to going to the beach)  
    
5. My posture commands respect  
    - you know those people that walk in a room and command respect & almost admiration? It's never a slouchy, skinny little guy is it? Exactly. That's what I radiate whether it's on stage or walking into a meeting room  
    
6. My body is a huge asset, never a liability  
    - I have dialed the relationship down with my body in so greatly that we understand each other perfectly which makes it that we take excellent care for each other  
    
7. I dialed in sports in nature  
    - I love doing sports in nature that help me completely disconnect from everything else and deeply connect with my body  
    
8. I am an athlete  
    - I have the mental fortitude & discipline of an athlete that is able to go deep when that's required

# ==Purpose==

Energy moves mountains. Health & Fitness is the key to A-player energy.

  

1. Big goals require big energy  
    - I need all the energy I can get, literally one of the few "depth" parameters I can influence with my choices  
    
2. Look good, feel good  
    - As we've figured out by now, confidence is a key component in making dreams come alive. Looking good helps with that.  
    
3. Self-love is where it all starts  
    - Taking care of your self is a huge way of developing that loving relationship with yourself  
    
4. Be connected & present  
    - if you keep tap on what you're body is trying to tell you, you can very well notice certain emotions coming up (in your body) and channel them accordingly - allowing you to choose your reaction and therefore leaving the choice for depth of connection. Thus a more connected & present self, beneficial to all around you  
    
5. Energise & Inspire others  
    - Lead by example  
    
6. Create Clarity, Choose Joy  
    - When you are able to listen to & accommodate your body, joy is a not far off consequence
