> [!important] Consciously Connect with Love

# ==Beliefs==

1. Spirituality is about experiencing oneness in a profound way  
    - it's about remembering rather than knowing  
    
2. Spirituality helps you stay connected to the intangibles of the universe & love  
    - it's about feeling what you know rather than knowing what you know  
    
3. Spirituality is highly personal  
    - it is so by design & default. It's one of the reasons you can't explain how meditation feels but by approximation but that doesn't mean that you don't know  
    
4. Spirituality can provide a guiding light in times where you're lost  
    - It can function as a mechanism to trust in what's coming & what's around you. It's about sculpting what you're being so what you dó can flow from that  
    
5. It's about noticing  
    - Spirituality is about staying sensitive to the magic that happens in your life  
    
6. It's about seeing what you can't see so you can envision the better version  
    - Again, there's this element of trust, of letting come through of evolving, ...  
    

# ==Vision==

1. I have a highly developed sense of intuition  
    - & I've built my life around maximising the utility from this intuition  
    
2. I have a group of people with whom I deeply connect  
    - Mostly self-dev junkies like myself, constantly looking to improve myself & the world  
    
3. I use my intuition daily as a voice for good  
    - Wether it's for the world or the people around me - I am looking to connect & uplevel their experience  
    
4. My life decisions are completely driven by love  
    - I avoid fear based decisions  
    
5. I regularly feel & connect with my one-ness  
    - I regularly experience overwhelming feelings of gratitude & bliss towards this thing called life  
    
6. I have found harmony  
    - My thoughts, feelings and actions are deeply aligned  
    

# ==Purpose==

1. I'm here to lift the tide with all boats.  
    - By connecting to my intuition & a love source I've got two foundational elements that help me fire that up  
    
2. What's the point of only using 20% of anything  
    - Life without spirituality is like deciding that the only meaning of life is to eat, work, sleep repeat. Spirituality speaks to the ability of us as humans to explore the invisible, the intangible that does have an influence on our lives.  
    
3. Depth ≥ Length  
    - Spirituality is a beacon towards continuously deepening our lives  
    

# ==Strategy==

1. Meditation  
    - I will meditate every day to connect & center on my intuition through love, self-acceptance & gratitude  
    
2. Love  
    - I will starte every morning with a loving practice deciding on consciously giving something to someone that day  
    
3. Self-Acceptance  
    - I will do work to release self doubt through a weekly reflection exercise. Every weekend I go over my journal entries of that week & bundle in my Notion what I learned from that  
    
4. Gratitude  
    - Every morning & evening I will write down three thing I'm grateful for  
    
5. Input  
    - Just like my body's on a healthy diet, so do I put my mind on a healthy diet
