1. Money = Energy  
    - By seeing money is energy it becomes a lot less abstract & takes its role as a means to an end rather than the end itself.  
    
2. Making money is easy  
    - All you need to do is set up a couple of assets that create a cashflow  
    
3. A lot of money puts you in a position to give  
    - Become a pulsing node in the web of life  
    
4. Value Creation → Money  
    - Money is an effect as a consequence of your value creation  
    
5. Money is an amplifier  
    - It can help make bigger what's already there, but you need something to amplify. The more meaningful that basis is, the better. Money can be used to accelerate & grow things

    - Money is a facilitator. This can never be an end, it is always a means.

    - You can use money to amplify assets. As you grow your capital, the money itself becomes the asset. But to get there, you need assets of your own making.
