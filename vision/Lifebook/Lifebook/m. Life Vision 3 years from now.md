**Tom’s Vivid Vision | my life in 2025**

Intro

Can ya believe it. We’re updating this one. As I’ve just gone beyond what we deemed possible three years ago - exited my first company and am about to embark on this adventure with Entrepreneur First, I’ve taken the time to come to Lisbon - get away from it all & recalibrate. (Only briefly) looking back - it’s crazy to think where I was 3 years ago. A student, with a 2 year old kid on the other side of the planet trying to figure out what the heck to do with the rest of his life. Having done a similar exercise 3 years ago, slowly but steadily climbing out of one of the darkest periods of my life, I had summoned all of my drive & creativity to conjure up a vision that could excite me. It’s crazy to think that I’ve blown past what I could’ve imagined to achieve in three years. Today, I write with a much deeper rooted sense of confidence & a skill, heart & mindset I simply did not have 3 years ago. Naturally, that amps up the vision. As I start thinking about what I can expect of myself to make of my life in the next three years, I get dizzy - in the best way possible.

To dive into the future, I will describe what a typical day, week & month look & feel like for me in 3 years. As useful as this tool has ever been to me, this time feels like the prefect time to recenter. So let’s do it.

  

I believe you don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your system. So for the new year I re-calibrate my values to a comprehensive life vision that I write out every 3 years. It’s a blueprint for who I need to become to attract the life I want. i find that a lot more useful in everyday use than a list of goals that remind me of what I don’t yet have.

## My life rhythm

# A typical weekday

I wake up at 5 am & as I see my girlfriend, I can’t believe how lucky I am with this hot, kind & smart woman waking up next to me. We wake up in the nicest way possible - with automated lights, temperature, great smells, a beautifully, uncluttered room & a reminder of why my life is so exciting at that time. I spend the first 20 minutes consuming something that excites me, that gets me inspired about the life I’m building. I’ve recently moved to a really nice house that has very clean, healing & creativity inducing energy. The house has high ceilings & a different room for each different purpose. There’s a bureau, a kitchen + dining room, a relaxing, reading & recharging room, a meditation room, a workout room, a music room, an amazing bathroom & a guest room. I then start to work for 1,5 hour on my highest leverage project with no internet - purely focussed on output. I then get ready to go to the gym or go for a run. I love the neighbourhood I live in as it has beautiful nature close by that, as I go for a run, helps me to center for the day. I come back to take a quick shower in my a-mazing bathroom that has a built in stereo & helps me take a charging moment for myself.  I head to the meditation room to take a full 30 minutes to set intentions for the day. I then head downstairs where my girlfriend has prepped us a healthy smoothy - but before we drink that, we share a coffee & talk about what we’re excited for that day. We head out for the day in our electric car or bike - depending on the weather & our mood - excited to listen to a great podcast or audio book that’s driving & probing some of my thinking.

As I get to the office around 10, half of the team is already in. We’ve created a culture of “impact maximisation” rather than “busyness maximisation” - that means that everyone gets evaluated on the impact they make on the company & the world around them. This also means that if they make their impact after 9pm, they should be able to. As a general rule, meetings can only be scheduled between 11 & 17h. So my first meeting for that day is scheduled around 11. I spend most of my day giving feedback on the work from the team. Most of my work is on protecting the vision, fostering a healthy culture & designing an organisational machine that can outperform & get the most out of our people. I absolutely love the people I get to work with - smart, thoughtful, good humoured people that are truly driven by making a difference. Everyone in my direct team, inspires me. They’ve all passed the “would I work for them?”, check. As the company grows, I start taking more speaking gigs. I love being the face of the company & using it to be a voice in what it takes to upgrade our society. The podcast has proven to be an incredible tool in that. I absolutely LOVE the people I work closely with.

I head home around 17h30, to eat with my girlfriend around 18h. We’ve recently invested in having a chef meal-prep for us. So we’ve got delicious, healthy meals every night in a matter of minutes. Depending on the amount of work that would need to still get done, I take the time from 18h30 till 20h30 - 21h to either work a little bit or unwind from the day with my girlfriend. Around 21h, I kickoff my evening ritual that consists of writing in my journal, following a Mindvalley course & then reading for about an hour. My reading habit constantly helps me feed & reinforce my existing mental models & helps me discover new ones. These rich amount of mental models have proven useful in many situations, which, in whatever setting, quickly gives me the reputation of being a quick, clear thinker. Right before lights out I do a 10 minute meditation that does gratitude & intention for the next day.

Throughout the day, I feel feelings of inspiration, awe, purpose, drive, friendship, belonging, faith, depth, joy, love & impact. I barely distinguish between “work & life”. My life is my work - I see life as a fundamental act of creation, whether it be relationships, actual output - it all manifests in impact, and i’m trying to maximise the positive kind. It’s all about creating fun along the way. It’s not because 90% of society does something in a certain way, that that needs to be the way that you do it. Of course, flexibility is a key trait to have for joy & there should always be room for intuition.

# A typical weekend

My weekday starts on Monday & ends on Thursday evening. Every Thursday evening, I have a date night with my girlfriend. We’ve both committed to getting to know each-other in depth & help each-other evolve for the better. We truly are life partners in this. The fact that we truly do not have to worry about anything financial means that we make it a sport to get creative about these date nights. Very often it’s an awesome restaurant, but we look to really make these experiences.

The weekends I take at least half a day to really be immersed in nature, either through a hike, mountain-biking, rowing, flying, … The point is to truly disconnect & recharge.

Other than that, the “weekend” still revolves around what other people would call “work” - as I’ve worked to make no distinction, the only difference is that in the weekend the “disciplined” part of it fades a little bit & leaves a lot more room for exploration rather than exploitation. So this is where I take extra time to read a book I’ve wanted to read or explore spaces that could be solutions to problems we’re facing.

It’s also in the weekend that I make time to see friends & connect with them deeply - either by taking them onto my “nature adventure time” or inviting them for dinner at our place. My friends are absolutely extraordinary - they inspire me deeply just by being who they are. I can always call them & I really do have a deep connection with them. My philosophy around friendship is: be the friend you’d like to have.

# A typical month

Each month, I have a set of specific character trait that I try to focus on for that month & an intellectual goal I aspire to attain. Every month, I do a one or two day micro-weekend getaway with my girlfriend that where we both take the time to briefly reflect & look forward to the next month. This is where we set these kinds of goals.

In my girlfriend I’ve truly found someone I can deeply connect with. Our love is built on deep mutual respect, a total joy & love for each other’s company -  a similar drive & recognition of each-other’s potential and a healthy stimulation for each other’s greatness. I am so amazing that I was able to attract a total “out-of-my-league” girlfriend. My constantly increasing self love, self-trust, courage & confidence have, over the last three years, definitely helped skew chances in my favour. I’ve been able to make it a habit to start conversations with ridiculously smart, good looking & kind women from a place of wanting, not needing. My main mindset around dating has been: attract, don’t chase. The combination of all these factors has really payed off. Also, I’ve really learned to not take it so seriously & have fun with it.

When it comes to the character trait that we recalibrate on this weekend getaway, this is a trait that I believe I will have most to gain with in the upcoming month - say for example that the month promises to be particularly challenging when it comes to making leadership decisions, I will focus on making servant leadership one of my core character traits by reading, seeking advice & mentors around that specific trait a little extra that month.

When it comes to the learning this can be a course, a couple of books read, a mentor met or all of them together. My main tool, however, to push myself intellectually, is to constantly be pushing myself beyond my comfort zone. This is part of the reflection part where I ask myself, giving the current context of my life, am I pushing myself enough? If I’m not, I come up with a challenge as to how I might come up with a challenge that pushes me further.

To keep enriching myself, learn twice by teaching & sharing what I know as well as find mentors that truly inspire me, I try to go for lunches with at least 4 people a month & organise an “impact dinner” at least once a month in the weekends with people that I really admire or have heard great things about. Many of my mentors have launched 100M$+ companies that are impacting millions of people’s lives.

It’s really fun to check in & grow together with my girlfriend. We’re really able to balance each-other out in our cycles of ups & downs - simply hold space when needed & push when that’s needed. We truly feel like home to each other. Also, our sex & drive to explore keeps that side of things beyond exciting. We’ve gotten really into tantra and build that into our lives.

# Each quarter

Each quarter, I take at least one to two full weeks off. In these weeks I spend at least one week to  go surf, ski, climb, run a marathon or do some other kind of intense “in nature” sport. The other week is spent relaxing at a beach, exploring new cultures or new views. The point is to personally re-calibrate.

Attached to this is my deep commitment to health, wealth & vitality. Having health & fitness as one of my top priorities, I very often get the compliment that I radiate healthy & good energy. I’m ripped but not bulky as I consider myself more of an athlete than a bodybuilder. Not only do these consistent sporting choices & sporting events to work towards build my drive to keep bettering my performance, my self-discipline, my stamina & protect my ability to be energetic - but they also build my confidence & self-love. As I look in the mirror, I like what I see.

The impact these quarterly breaks have on the rest of my life, is huge. It’s a clear motivator & driver to consistently eat healthy - which I’ve made super easy with this chef, meal-preps & healthy snacks. It also makes it easier for me to push when that’s needed & live my life in cycles of sprints & recovery moments. Having these fixed recovery moments to work towards pushes me to do 12-16 hour days when needed and gives me a clear, predefined goal post to work towards and a framework to be intentional about my time - fighting parkingsons law. This is also great for my couple, as despite the hard work, we have these 2 weeks every quarter to look forward to.

# Each year

Each year, I have Scarlett with me for at least one full month. I never miss her birthdays. We’ve now also found an arrangement for her to be with me for at least a month in the summer. This has really strengthened our bond. I’m also starting to discuss a family with my current girlfriend. We both want a big family.

Financially, I’ve created the ability to make as much money on the demand as I’d like. Money flows to me easily & I never, ever worry about it. I do the dreaming & the money and other resources flow to me to make those dream a reality. The reason this works so well is because my dreams go way beyond me. It’s as if I’m co-creating with the universe & the universe is channeling what it wants to see come to fruition through people that remain open to it. I’ve learned to master the art of flow in all aspects of life & learned to surf on every single universal frequency.

When it comes to the work I do, I create. I shape the world & upgrade the lives of millions of peoples through my creations. I love the act of creating with scale in mind. I get most of my energy from rallying people around a vision & putting into motion plans, thoughts & theories to go from potential to kinetic energy. The cycle of creation is what is at the core of who I am & the work I do. This going from zero to 1 is infinite value creation and that translates to me being able to capture large chunks of it as well.

For my quality of life, I never worry, I get to experience things that make me grow & that allow me increasingly to help others grow. I don’t have to deal with meaningless tasks and I live in a very nice, clean environment. I have a room for everything & I am able to do any trip I want at any time I want without thinking twice about it. Every year I set leisure goals such as visiting this country or learning to surf a barrel. I’m able to disconnect at any point at any time in my life. I’m able to be super generous with my friends and this allows me to spend loads of quality time with them as well. Also when it comes to clothes, I do not have a limit. I love buying new clothes & dressing well.

All in all, the life I live is centered around growth, contribution & love and I freaking love it.
