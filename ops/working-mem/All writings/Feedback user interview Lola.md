1. General user interview feedback:
    
    1. Here’s what you did really well:
        1. Lots of questions
        2. Room to voice opinions
        3. Double clicks on things he brushes past that are interesting to us
    2. Here’s what you could improve:
        1. General 2 main points of feedback:
            
        2. The first 5 minutes should be about understanding if they have the problem we’re solving.
        3. Not all opinions are created equal & most of them are worthless.
            1. This is a recruiter & we’re building our tool for hiring managers to skip the recruiter so there are different lessons we learn from each.
        4. Avoid leading questions
            1. Too invasive → loaded question
        5. How can you lead this back to experiences they currently have?
            1. How do you currently assess candidates? Is this better? Worse? Why?
        6. Lead the conversation from their problems, not our solution
            1. What do you see here is a different question to → say you’re looking for a candidate → what do you normally look for first? Can you find that here?
