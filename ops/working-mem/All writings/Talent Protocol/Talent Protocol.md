How would you define the current point of your career life cycle?

- **Keeping my learning curve as steep as possible**: Beginning of 2022 I sold my first relatively successful company. Much to the dismay of my grandma because it was only in the last 6 months that I started to make good money. She didn’t understand why I had worked so hard to then sell at the moment it was starting to gain traction. A big reason was that I felt my learning curve was stagnating & the growth & Impact I could have from building that business was capped. At 25, I didn’t take that as a good sign. Somebody once talked to me about “learn - earn - return” periods in your career. And usually they say that from 20 to about 35 it’s “learn”, from 35 to 50 its “earn” and from 50 to 65 it’s “return". That’s the general cycle I intended to follow for my career so for now I prioritise keeping my learning curve as steep as possible.

When and why did you start exploring web3 as a career path?

- I have this thesis around “breakthrough entrepreneurship”. Basically it states that if you want build something that has the potential to impact a billion people’s lives positively, you have to leverage important inflection points on three different layers: technologically, socially & regulatory. Web3 embodies all 3. As I have a life goal to impact a billion+ people’s lives positively it was a no-brainer to jump into the space head first & start figuring out what needs to be built that can potentially impact a billion+ people’s lives.

What were your main struggles while entering web3?

- Access. A lot of the online communities feel gated. It’s not until after I did my first conference, joined & tried to add value to a couple of DAOs, that I developed some meaningful relationships with “insiders”. I felt very much like an outsider in the beginning.

What's your biggest professional accomplishment?

- Landing my first big client in my previous company on nothing but willpower & conviction lol. I had nothing but some un-grounded confidence & ideas.

What was your biggest web3 mistake?

- Sending polygon tokens to an ethereum address 🤷🏼‍♂️ - I suggest we use different pre-fixes for each chain. Let’s leave the 0x for ETH & all the rest can use others.

What resources and/or skills would you recommend to someone entering web3?

- Go to any of the “ETH” conferences - you’ll learn & make connections in a week that will take you 6 months to make online.

Who have been the most influential people in your web3 journey?

- Other founders. Such WAGMI energy in the web3 founders’ community.

What would you do if you were at the start of your career today?

- Read Naval Ravikant’s almanack & then create a strategy around those ideas. I gave up, sometimes unnecessarily so, great friendships in the name of “building big” in my career. Sure, there’s sacrifices to be made, but Naval has some great ideas on how to achieve & balance both.

What investment (of time, energy or money) brought you the most return?

- Reading & writing.
