the tl;dr = i believe ai & blockchain are going to do to the recruitment industry what the internet & booking.com did to the travel industry. at the core they are (complex) information brokers which ai & blockchain are going to replace by increasing the context-matching bandwidth (more relevant information used in the matching versus the limited data set that the limited processing power of human biases lead to) & blockchain by making credibility portable to other ecosystems & therefore scalable (5-star ratings or linkedin endorsements ain't it.)  
  
as to how, i could literally write a book about this so will try to answer this question by listing out the chapters that i would draft with a one-liner explaining what i mean.  
  
chapter 1: the right person on the right project for the right reasons. -> recruitment is a sub-optimal solution to the hiring problem. it's like going to the library to find information instead of using google.  
  
chapter 2: the 3 fundamental challenges with the actual problem - hiring/talent matching. -> flawed signals lead to a very expensive information asymmetry problem that skews the incentives and leads to a sub-optimal dominant strategy when repeatedly playing the “hiring game”.  
  
chapter 3: referrals - the best talent match on the planet today.  
-> they're impossible to scale but we can scale the thing that makes them great - which is context & credibility.  
  
chapter 4: ai & blockchain as perfect context & credibility scalars  
  
chapter 5: ai & blockchain as complentary tech in solving the talent matching problem -> at the core blockchain is a deterministic technology with a consensus layer to arrive at common truth + at the core ai is a stochastic technology that is by nature non-deterministic.  
  
chapter 6: signal theory. how ai can be used to increase signal over noise in the talent matching game.  
  
chapter 7: understanding the information asymmetry problems of the talent & the hiring manager -> how to maximally reduce the known unknowns on either side. it's not because the talent has the information that the hiring manager will succeed in obtaining it.  
  
chapter 8: the game-theory of hiring -> what games do we need to design that have a dominant strategy with optimal outcomes for all parties involved? (work you love with people you like)  
  
chapter 9: blockchain and the role of implementing better games -> different skin-in-the-game mechanics lead to different forms of currency - social, reputational, ...  
  
chapter 10: addressing bias through a framework of primitives & compute -> having a harvard diploma (a primitive) can yield very different hiring outcomes based on the compute you use. some people might think harvard grads are great - others might think they are stuck up know-it-alls  
  
chapter 11: talent prediction markets -> what's the value of a skill in different people & who determines this?  
  
chapter 12: bringing it all together in the final vision of how the world of work is changing (more than 50% of the us workforce is projected to freelance, companies are ipo'ing with fewer and fewer full-time employees) and how an on-demand liquid internet workforce built on the principle of doing what you love with people you like fits into that world. -> a world where work, works for all of us instead of the other way around.  
  
i could go on for a bit tbh but this is where i would start if i were to start writing this book tomorrow.  
  
happy to chat about this on a call also btw - bc literally this is not even 1/1000th of what i could say about this lol
