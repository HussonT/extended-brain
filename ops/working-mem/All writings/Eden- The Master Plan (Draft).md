# Why: A thriving internet workforce built on the principle of doing meaningful work you love

From day one Eden is an exploration of the answer to the question: what does a better model for work look like? With employee engagement numbers oscellating between a meager 15% - 25% in recent years, it’s clear that work isn’t working for the majority of the population, and even less for the younger generations. That means that the overwhelming majority of our global workforce comes home drained, uninspired & unengaged. That’s the majority of our workforce that’s on the back-foot when it comes to being the best spouse, parent or friend they can be.

Work is literally one of the most important things in our lives as on average we dedicate 1/3 of our lives to it, sleep being another 1/3 btw. Work is foundational because every other thing your thinking about as more important right now requires work. Those reasons combined with the tides of change set in motion by COVID and the maturing of paradigm shifting technologies such as AI & Blockchain make now the perfect time to evolve our way of working on a societal scale.

You might ask: “evolve our way of working into what?” At Eden, we believe it’s time to evolve from a work-model rooted in rigid, hierarchical industrial revolution ideas to one rooted in the flexible, purpose-led possibilities of the Internet, AI & Blockchain. With more than 50% of the US workforce projected to freelance by 2027, it’s clear that we’re done putting up with un-engaging work & we want more and more to make work, work for us. The only thing stopping us? The tools to fully make a thriving internet workforce built on the principle of doing meaningful work you love a reality.

# How: A better talent match

“That’s all well & good Tom - but how are you going to do that?”. Well, I’m glad you asked. The short answer is a better talent match: everything starts with getting the right person on the right project for the right reasons. Without that, we’re off to a bad start. Our current talent matching tools, such as LinkedIn & other job boards, talent marketplaces such as UpWork & very expensive recruiters are in the grand scheme of things clearly not succeeding at this - and I can go into the many reasons of why that is, and I will, but not in this “master plan”. The point is, we need a radical new approach to thinking about matching talent with opportunities & vice-versa to make our vision of a thriving internet workforce built on the principle of doing meaningful work you love a reality.

We came to that better way of matching talent by asking the question: what produces the very best talent match on the planet today? The answer: referrals. The problem with referrals however, is that they are near impossible to scale well. So we asked the first-principles question: If we can’t scale the referrals as such, can we scale the thing that makes referrals great? Turns out that which makes referrals great is context & credibility*. Things we can beautifully scale with AI & Blockchain.

It’s with a clear vision of how these technologies scale the core elements of what provides the greatest talent match on the planet today, that we’re setting out to build the tools necessary to enable a thriving internet workforce built on the principles of doing meaningful work you love.

# What: Build tools that power the internet workforce

So here’s the plan in 3 steps:

### 1. Assess: understand talent requirements.

**Build the ultimate AI-powered hiring side-kick to help managers make better & faster hiring decision, save time, money & headaches by letting AI take care of all the time-consuming, low-value-add & tedious tasks associated with sourcing & vetting candidates. This allows us to deeply understand opportunity talent requirements, which is key to be able to match the perfect person to that project.**

  
Our goal is to be essential for hiring managers regarding everything talent management. Initially we’ll do this by solving very niche problems where current well known platforms just won’t cut it anymore. v  

while also making it easy to gather the necessary context for AI-powered context matching. We're starting with the hard side of the "talent<>opportunity" equation to make it easier down the line. By positioning ourselves next to hiring managers and offering a "come for the tool, stay for the network" strategy, we can gain steady access to amazing opportunities. Our vision is to seamlessly integrate ourselves into a manager's talent management workflow, spotting opportunities collaboratively with a high degree of context. By being present in all aspects of talent management, we ensure a constant flow of high-quality projects to match people with. This is the foundation of our vision for a plug & play internet workforce.

### 2. Acquire: go specifically where the talent likes to be.

**Build the ultimate AI-powered career coach & talent coordinator that empower online-communities to manage, up-level & monetise their talent pools. This allows us to deeply understand talent abilities & community-contextualised credibility.**

There are 3 reasons that have an accelerating effect on each-other that we’re intending to tap into. Those reasons are: 1) online-communities attract both passive & active talent, 2) online-community founders understand that talent is their greatest asset but have no ways to meaningfully or effectively monetise that talent base & 3) online-communities bring an additional understanding of credibility for each of its members which is crucial for us to understand in order to get to the best talent match possible.

1) The talent you really want to hire is rarely talent that has been on the market for 6 months. And talent that is on the market for 6 months is usually talent that can benefit from some mentoring, coaching or growth. Talent that are in online communities are either those mentor types or mentees. In short, they are amazing untapped talent pools that are a great alternative to linkedin if they can be mapped out properly.

2)

### 3. Access: make the internet workforce plug & play.

**Build the ultimate AI powered talent marketplace that can match people on a project level rather than on a role level & allows any company to plug-in the liquid Internet workforce with a talent match that is 1000x better than what we have today. Expand the toolset required to make a thriving internet workforce built on the principles of doing meaningful work you love the world’s primary modus operandi.**

Our hypothesis is that, as we are able to provide significantly higher quality matching, hiring managers will hire more freelancers through Eden, as the switching cost on a project basis is much lower that way.

  

*Context & credibility are the core elements that make referrals great because the more context you have about an opportunity & a person, the better you can assess whether they’re a good match. And then there is the credibility, or “social capital at stake”, aspect of the referral - meaning that if I make a bad referral, this is going to reflect badly on me as referrer. This makes me only refer when I’m confident the social capital return will be positive. Both elements working together result in the best possible talent matches.
