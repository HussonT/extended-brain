# Find your people, love their work.

**Great, inspired work** is the single biggest societal progress lever we have.

Inspired, motivated A-player teams are at the root of everything that makes our daily lives better. Yet, today 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work & this while we spend 1/3 of our lives working.

The old way of working has its roots in the industrial revolution. In that time, it made sense turn people into robotic “[organisation-men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Organization_Man)” with 40-year careers - serving one org as a lot of context is built up in the human capital. This paradigm has been fading over the last 70 years, driven by huge technological leaps & a globalising world. Now, this paradigm is at a breaking point.

Over 50% of the US workforce is projected to freelance by 2027. This shows an evolution towards a liquifying workforce. From company centric ladder-climbing careers to talent & aspiration centric portfolio careers with high degrees of talent-agency. On the hiring side, this movement is being met by technology enabled companies who get a lot more done with drastically lower & lower headcount. This also makes optimising for the most talented person for the job the right strategy.

These trends combined make it clear that the future of work consists of small, mighty & dedicated core-teams, supplemented by an on-demand, inspired "liquid workforce". This future requires effective, instant matching of talent to opportunities. Eden protocol is the global talent coordination protocol that makes such instant, inspired matches possible.

Having an instant-match made by your AI that feels like a referral of a smart friend you trust reduces the switching cost for both employer & employee to near-zero. Eden makes it easier than ever to find your people & love your work which are the two pillars required to unlock the most globally inspired workforce in the history of the world.

# What Eden feels like for

## Talent

**Eden has become synonymous with portfolio career.**

You schedule work as easy as it is to order food on Uber-eats on Eden. It is the primary source for high-quality, engaging & hyper-relevant work that fits a talent’s skills & ambitions perfectly. It is therefore also the place where your skills are maximally valued. Eden lets talent combine the freedom of freelancing with the mentorship, actionable feedback from peers & the ability to build reputation enjoyed in a more classical career env. By making those things portable across projects, talent gets to build up these intangible assets across the projects & companies without losing them each time in Eden.

**Eden’s ecosystem of talent agents help navigate portfolio careers effectively.**

The result is that talent uses Eden to design their careers with different AI-agents in the ecosystem acting as coaches & mentors to help them reach the next level of projects they’d like to unlock. This also means that talent gets to work when, why, on what & wherever they like. Work that works for talent = inspired work.

## Hiring managers

**A hiring team with a personal, verified network like they’ve never encountered.**

Hiring managers benefit greatly from having multiple AI-agents with access to the vast Eden talent network. These agents act as diligent, intelligent assistants, aiding them in finding the right person for the right project and for the right reasons at all times. It’s like having a magic talent button that makes the set of globally best fitting candidates appear.

**Talk to less, but more of the right people.**

These agents help unlock consistent, relevant talent availability and automatically keep tabs on candidates who fit the a hiring manager’s preference profile. The days of not finding the right fit for months are long, long gone. Eden also allows hiring managers to be more selective and go deeper into the human aspect of talent that is likely a great fit - and do so more quickly.

**Maximise talent utility.**

When a candidate is not a good fit, hiring managers are less hesitant to let them go. Conversely, they work harder to retain exceptional talent, as it is increasingly easier for such talent to find alternative opportunities.

**Build (only) with the best who are excited to build with you.**

Eden provides the ability for teams to be flexible and efficient like never before. The power to engage the best global talent to solve specific issues within 24 hours is an incredible advantage. This leads to generally more engaged talent, resulting in higher, inspired productivity. It's the ultimate experience for anyone trying to build anything with the help of others.

## Talent Validators

Peers can validate each other’s talent in Eden. Not only does it help them support people they believe in, but it also allows them to monetize their skill to recognise other talent and network more effectively. Recruiters regularly buy talent keys of talent they truly believe in. This creates talent-influencers that have a disproportionate impact when they buy your key. Some people make millions from effectively validating talent alone.

# The Eden Infra

At the core of the Eden Protocol infra are our 3 services: talent- & opportunity-context capture, validation & matching. Our focus & refusal to work on anything but getting these basics right has allowed us to build a very strong set of foundations. Consistently removing things & building garbage collection habits with these basics in mind has allowed us to operate smoothly & smooth = fast. Strong foundations & smart tradeoffs in the name of ease of iteration & adaptability have been core to our ability to have the wind of rapid innovations accelerate our sails rather than “destroy” us. One of our core tenants “simplicity on the far-side of complexity” & a consistent questioning of the requirements has allowed us to keep a lean & mean codebase.

# The Eden Talent & Opportunity Network

The seeds for Eden becoming a leading, global talent & opportunity network are starting to be visible. Our relentless focus on building mechanisms that keep the talent bar high while growing the network is paying off as it is becoming a status symbol to be a part of the Eden network. All of our metrics are therefore focussed on quality rather than vanity, the most important ones being talent/opportunity density, successful matches, response rates & referral-based growth rates of the network. Initially taking a “facebook approach” of letting existing talent-networks serve themselves better through Eden has made it possible for us to deliver value while scaling our own network & has essentially become our “come for the tool, stay for the network” that has worked pretty well for us.

# The Eden Native Apps

Similar to how apple builds a set of core-capabilities for the whole apps-ecosystem to use, so to are we building a set of core capabilities on top of our infra & talent + opportunity network. There are three distinct apps that are Eden-native:

## Freelance collective tools

Our belief that the future of work has freelance collectives at their core has paid off. We believe this because these collectives combine the freedom of freelancing with the structural benefits you get at a company such as mentorship, support, etc. We’ve let that belief guide us in our approach of product-led protocol development. We’ve built a suite of tools that help freelancer collectives vet, grow, manage & monetise own & each-others’ talent more effectively. Thanks to our tools, we’ve unlocked a whole new wave of people who want to start & grow freelancer collectives. These collectives always are started around inspiring freelancers or online-personalities that have built a brand around certain values & norms - our tools make it effortless for them to monetise & grow the talent they are able to gather around them.

## Developer tooling for hiring-agents

On the other side of the equation, we’re also making access to the Eden network easy & effective through agents. We’re providing an X-code like environment to developers to let them build custom hiring agents that can plug into the Eden network. Different hiring agents are optimised for different use-cases.

## Developer tooling for talent-agents

As the network grows & all these individual freelancers are thinking about their next steps + creating a vision for what forward momentum looks like for their career, they’re looking for a confidant that has all their professional context & can help them reason through what the different paths for their ambitions could be. Eden already has all that context & it is for this reason that we’ve started building easy to use tools that agent-developers can use to build, either their personal agent or sell agent-types that are optimised for specific use-cases or ambitions.

# The Eden Ecosystem Agents

## Talent Agents

### Talent-Coach agents

YC has developed their Founder coach agent that taps into a Eden users’ professional & personal context of an individual (aspiring) founder through the Eden dev tools. This context is then used to coach them through the choices that present themselves to become a (better) founder.

The COO-alliance has developed their own talent agent for talent with the aspiration to become COO’s on top of the Eden tools.

### Talent-Agent agents

Many major university has developed & set up their talent agents that they make available to their students first year after they graduate. These universities can give private access to alumni networks to help with referrals & help enforce/maintain a talent-standard that their brand stands for.

## Hiring Agents

### Custom & Private Enterprise Agents

Many big enterprises, such as Meta have built their own hiring agent that has private access to all of their internal company data & connects to the Eden network as if it were their agents private, verified rolodex to find their ideal matches that are more than likely to be perfect fits. This also means that they can start operating at a “money-ball” level, thinking about composing the best team.

### Industry Agents

Robert Half, the well known staffing bureau, is launching generic hiring agents for specific verticals such as supply chain startups hiring agents, as well as spinning up specific head-hunt agents on behalf of clients.

### Org-type Agents

YC runs its “work at a startup” job board with the help of Eden enabled AI-hiring-agents.

McKinsey has launched a specific hiring agent for fortune 500 companies.

## Validation Agents

### Community-connector Agents

Online communities are spinning up agents on top of the Eden network to grow their own communities as well as create opportunities for the talent in their communities by turning membership into hiring signals.

### Reputation Agents

Harvard has deployed an agent that goes around & buys talent keys of profiles they believe fit their vision of great talent.

# The Eden Company Culture

Eden is the place on the planet if you want to build tools that help people find their people & do work they love. Everyone at Eden is in some way shape or form a bit of an artist with great taste - we actually scan for this in our hiring process - the reason for this is that we believe an innate sense of beauty & intuition are forms of intelligence that only human can access and are building our whole company around that - and if you think about it our mission is also built around this: inspired work requires that innate human knowledge of what inspired work looks & feels like.

# Eden Customers & Partners

We’ve installed practices that make us regularly go deep in our empathy with customers & partners to really understand what it’s like to work with us from all different angles. We’re heavily inspired by concepts such as “unreasonable hospitality” to make sure we go above & beyond for all of our users, customers & partners. This single mindset of “unreasonable hospitality” has brought us very far & has always kept front & center that in the end, we’re truly, always in any case dealing with people.

## What users say about us

> I don’t even consider an opportunity if it hasn’t gone through Eden vetting/matching. I’ve met the coolest people & have literally dream projects that align with my skills & aspirations that I didn’t even dare dream of back when I was still stuck in my corporate job. Also, we’ve got a baby on the way and I’m picking up a whole bunch of extra projects right now so that I can really be present the first 6 months are little kiddo is going to be here.”  
>   
> — Jim Roberts, Product Manager  

## What customers say about us

> The most relevant talent-match results are found through Eden. We’ve literally re-designed our org to take advantage of the speed & quality of match that Eden enables. We’ve started operating a lot more like a movie production company with important projects being led by a director that is then empowered to put together their team specific to the movie/project. Thanks to Eden, we can find the people that already fit our culture & approaches best + the benefit of fresh new ideas with highly motivated people.  
>   
> — Tom Tippers, Founder of big telco  

  

> We are finally being able to only go for the projects that truly excite us. Eden has made allowed us to flip our model from trying to extract as much out of “a warm body” to maximising & nurturing the talent in people and getting rewarded for that. The talent-key mechanism is genius. We’ve been able to grow our community 4x in 3 months thanks to the hiring signal mechanism we’re producing + now we get to focus on the thing we love most - teaching & community.  
>   
> — Blake, Founder of freelance talent collective  

## What partners say about us

> Building in & with the Eden ecosystem has been a dream. A super smart, super thoughtful & “gets-shit-done” team that is also fun to interact with. The tech is smooth & without bloat and does exactly what it says it’s going to do. Their focus on not necessarily being first, but the best makes them a partner we want to & can count on.  
>   
> — Luke, dev responsible for building AI-agents on the YC team.  

## What investors say about us

> Eden is one of those once-in-a-generation business that don’t just surf the new paradigm, they’ve unlocked a new paradigm - and as most investors know, that’s where all the money & value gets created. We couldn’t be prouder of the team behind this & the vision they’ve been able to turn into a reality - very, very excited for the future ahead.  
>   
> — Cam & Matt, GPs at Brickyard  

  

> Our exact definition of a thunderlizzard.  
> — Mike Maples Jr., Partner at Floodgate  

# Eden Marketing & Branding

We understand that distribution is everything for our business. That’s why we built a powerful brand and a machine behind that brand that makes people want to be part of the story and use it as a symbol that signals their alignment with the values & aspirations that the brand stands for.

In all of our marketing, we celebrate inspired work & the teams of A-players that carry it out. We’ve invested & developed our brand to a point where you can confidently answer which famous people, if they’re looking for their next gig or would hire for their next big idea, would be on Eden.

## What the media says about us

> The new age of work is here: portfolio careers. They’re inspired, fractional & on-demand.  
> - Forbes  

> Small & mighty teams with A-player backup: How Eden is becoming the talent coordination layer of the web that unlocks inspired productivity.  
> - HBR  

> The purpose economy: how “find your people, love your work” became the backbone of our high-quality gig-economy.  
> - The Atlantic  

## What our competitors say about us

> We can’t even compete with this shit, they’re like the apple of hiring ecosystems - in a league of their own.  
>   
> - Moonhub recruiter  

> What Eden really got right is their understanding of bias & relevant signals in hiring. They really understood how relevant this is in powerful matching in the age of AI-agents. They’ve always said that you can’t make a hiring process without bias, what you can do is make it bias aware & understand the tradeoffs you’re making in the name of whatever the best match means to you.  
>   
> - Reid Hoffman, Founder Linkedin  

# Eden Location & Offices

For the first 20 people, we aim to be radically in person in the bay area. From then on, we’re open to being hybrid-remote as we know that to get the most skilled people to work on your project with you, their freedom is important and this is exactly what we preach as a company as well: small mighty teams backed up by a liquid workforce. This is the proto-stage before we can use our own tools to make that reality happen for others.

## What employees say about us

The most challenging, most exciting & most inspiring place to work. We’re at the heart of what great talent looks like. Many employees start companies of their own, enabled by the Eden ecosystem.

> What’s a better mission than helping the most talent people make the most of their talents? This has a huge impact on their personal lives, those around them and ultimately the world.  
> — Julia, Employee no. 3  

> I love how exciting, complex yet fulfilling the problems are that we get to work on. It’s a combination of psychology, technology & almost spirituality - as in “what am I put on this earth to do”. A never ending barrage of rewarding challenges here at Eden.  
> — Lou, Employee no. 23
