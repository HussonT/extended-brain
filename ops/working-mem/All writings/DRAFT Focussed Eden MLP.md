Eden’s (joineden.ai) community powered job-board interviews talent with AI & leverages web3 powered talent verification tools to allow web3 orgs like yours to unlock otherwise hidden talents in online communities. We’re live in Developer DAO, a community of 5000+ web3 devs. On the back of that we’re building the set of tools that will help you uncover the talent behind discord, telegram & twitter pfps. Here’s a quick demo video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXtLZZlpjAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXtLZZlpjAM)

In order to get the traction we want, we’re going to need to light our ember instead of trying to get the fire-pit perfect, because before we know it, it’s going to rain & our wood is going to be wet. That’s why in this document we’ll define a very clear, simple MLP in which we describe the value of that Minimum Lovable Product today.

As always, the best way to do this is to start with the users’ problems/challenges. I will describe the 3 archetypes with for each the user story tailored to our mvp personas that play a role in making this MLP a success. As we grow, we can expand the archetypal thinking to address the specific needs of more persona’s within the same archetype.

- **What’s the difference between an archetype & a user persona?**
    
    An archetype is a type of user with a foundational set of needs.  
    A persona is an instance of an archetype with very specific cases of that broader set of needs.  
    For example: Archetype: HMAN: Hiring Manager with foundational need “to find talent in the web3 space”.  
    - Persona 1: Web3 founder looking to grow his company  
    - Persona 2: Technical team lead growing his team  
    - Persona 3: Web3 recruiter  
    

For each section I’ll describe the main problems we’re solving for the target MLP persona, why we’re targeting that persona & what the MLP user stories are that we need to tackle in order to set ourselves on a path of success.

> Success for us comes down to growing the number of total relevant web3 talent interviewed.

  

Let’s get into it.

# HMAN - solving for Hiring Managers

The Hiring Manager archetype has the following statements that are always true:

1. One of their top-3 responsibilities/challenges is finding the right person to join their team
2. They have more information about what the opportunity requires than talent does
3. They have direct influence over the final hiring decision

## The H(iring)MAN(ager) MLP Persona

For the MLP we’re initially targeting **hiring managers who have an existing behaviour of posting a job to [cryptocurrencyjobs.co](http://cryptocurrencyjobs.com) or [web3jobs.com](http://web3jobs.com)**. Our goal is to make the experience they have with the other platforms feel ancient because we want to be their platform of choice for two reasons: their feedback & the applicant traffic they will drive to the job-posts.

**The main problem** we’re solving for them is that it’s really hard for them to find & assess great web3 talent as that talent is often hidden in discords, telegrams & on twitter. Our job-board & tools allow them to **save a ton of time accessing these hard to access talent pools** by having our AI do most of the engagement & vetting work for them. And the best thing is that this is all included in the price of one job-post.

## The HMAN - EPICS:USER STORY

There are 3 epics in the HMAN story: SOURCE, ASSESS & NEXT STEPS. Ultimately, those are the 3 foundational problems that we’re helping hiring managers with. Within those epics, there are a set of user stories that we enable that make our solution the best solution for them out there.

        - Improve the prompt of the AI to do the interview by having a bunch of seed questions here as well + a way to cover the best practices in a CEME way
    - tradeoffs & priorities
        - How to make this more meaningful - I feel like most people just breeze over this? Should we take it out?
    - Score topics
        - Better explenation of how this works + better prompt of the score topic creation.
    - Seed questions
        - Better prompt - fewer questions → most impactful questions?
