I’ve been thinking and what is the coolest thing about what we’ve built? The matching. If our vision is to build an AI that can refer talent as if they’re your friend, why don’t we build the UX that goes with that? The next question I think then becomes; how can we provide value asap or give a feeling of value asap and we’ve seen that users only apply if they see a job they like? What if we had a more apple music type onboarding where they tell us a little bit about who they are and at the end of that flow they immediately get the best fitting jobs for them to apply (doesn’t really matter if they’re active - we can chase down the right guys if we have the right type of talent applying) + we can learn from what they’re searching for if we build a similar type of experience on the hiring manager side where we learn about the ideal talent they’re looking for etc.

I think we can achieve this two way - we can make on-chain signals about talent searchable, so that means that the value we have is that we’re immediately letting you connect with people that have known web3 activity - which seems to be important for most web3 hiring managers & we can scrape all the jobs from web3 jobs & [cryptocurrencyjobs.com](http://cryptocurrencyjobs.com) & match them with the right people.

This way we create an experience that’s awesome from the get go + gets better as we grow the network so we can focus on growing the network & e-mailing people as we go and hack the network effects that way.

We can also setup an experience for wallet connect specifically, where somebody shows their interest on farcaster with Eden & if they’re an A or B they get an invite to do an interview with Eden.
