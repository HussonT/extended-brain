First off, thanks so much for taking the time to write what you wrote. I understand your general feeling of your effort not being matched with the potential reward/security around the reward and like I said earlier, in general - I agree.

I do think however that what you’re asking for is a bit of a tall order & I’ll explain why + will then give you a counter that I think makes sense with room for clear revision moments to align our incentives around helping you grow into the builder you’d like to become - whether that is CTO, Co-founder or anything else.

## 1. Why I think what you’re asking for is a bit of a tall order.

The proposal you’ve put down, especially the combination of cash + equity immediately begs the question what the opportunity cost to Eden for this is. For what you put down, Eden can get a founding engineer with min 5 years of startup experience in the bay area or at least in the US. For this amount, I am certain I can (eventually → and this is a key thing that I want to come back to) find somebody who is

1. **an A-player**  
      
    (which you have the potential to be, but aren’t yet - I’ll explain what an A-player is & how we can get to that together in a sec)
2. **with proven experience architecting & shipping a 0 to 1 product/sideproject/startup** that scaled (which - to my knowledge - you haven’t done outside of the context of your prev jobs)
3. **easy-to-fund credentials** like having built a previous company, be an alumni of an org like EF, YC or going to Stanford, working at FAANG or a hot-scaleup  
    (which you don’t have)  
    

& The bar for a potential co-founder is even higher than that and would start at just - which I have described here: [[Ideal co-founder]]

# 2 & 3 aren’t going to change, which is fine, I know what you can do & I believe in you - that’s all that matters to me right now - but just know that there’s an opportunity cost that Eden is paying there. However, I’d like to discuss on what you becoming an A-player would look like & what that would mean for your comp. Because, to come back to the key-word I used earlier: eventually, because that’s where, besides the amazing dedication & sacrifices you’ve already made & continue to make, most of your “power” is right now: Eden will be drastically slowed down if you leave & we will lose all the momentum we’ve been building up.

## 2. A counter that makes sense in my view.

I think, for now, a 3,5% & a $90K salary makes more sense, with an additional 2% & $40K performance being able to be unlocked based on clearly defined milestones.

This brings me back to the A-player thing.

I think A-players breed more A-players, so the best way to define an A-player is if other A-players want to work with them, which begs the question - what makes it fun to work with people. For better or worse, what that looks like - like you said - is my call. But of course, If i don’t communicate that clearly, you can’t know what the terms are - so don’t let these next things come across as an attack, because there’s no way you would know - but I think they form a solid basis for a discussion around what performance based looks like.

What makes an A-player:

1. There is a consistent pleasant surprise when they deliver work: there are 3 general ways you can pleasantly surprise.
    
    1. Quality of work: Deliver quality of work that exceeds expectations.
    2. Speed of work: Deliver work faster than expected.
    3. Type of work: Find a better, faster way to drive the relevant outcomes (v different from output).
    
    As you might notice, they all depend on expectations - and expectations are set through clear communication & a deep understanding of what the needle moving work is. so the main one here is communication & as we know that’s definitely a working point. If you want we can go over on a call how so far you’ve only really done one well so far (which is c. with the overhaul of the architecture) - but the others you’re defintely not scoring well yet.
    
2. There is trust that the other will always make the right decision
3. There is no need to spend much thinking power trying to catch what might slip through the cracks for the other.

## 3. What our next 3 months look like to help get you there.
