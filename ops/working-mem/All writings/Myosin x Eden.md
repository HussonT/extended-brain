# Why go further than a commercial relationship?

I think we share a vision that service DAOs should become easily upspinnable orgs that make it easy & effortless for people to get full work agency in this post covid, distributed, liquid work-era. Full work agency includes choosing where, with whom, why, on what and for how long you work. That means that service DAOs will effectively operate like network states where the main thing that will set them apart is the opinions around those preferences.

It’s also clear that service DAO’s have a long way to go. I think Myosin is one of the most effective/impressive implementations I have seen so far. This road ahead is potentially long and comes with its set of perils. To make sure that the risk does not come from misalignment between us and to ensure that we keep pushing & pulling each-other all the way to joint success, going further than a commercial relationship would make sense to me as we build the foundations of the vision we share, together.

# What’s my expectation of this collab concretely?

## Product

- Myosin provides input for our bi-weekly sprint (planning)
- Myosin commits to using eden & providing feedback to help improve

  

- Eden commits to delivering something new, usable & testable every 2 weeks

## Distribution

- Myosin helps Eden scale
- Myosin helps Eden fundraise

  

- Eden makes sure that Myosin gets its talent edge through Eden
- Eden makes sure that any type of demand gets funnelled

# How we’ll get incentives aligned

- Token/equity swap
    - If we win, you win - if you win, we win.
- A way around the canibalising problem
    - “if we help scale and fundraise for eden, that we're not cannabalizing ourselves”
    - ZK multiplayer referral auction model
        - We’ll have to figure this out regardless otherwise none of the communities willl onboard onto Eden
            - If this hypothesis turns out to be false - we should discuss & write down the different scenarios that ensue then to make sure this doesn’t happen
            - we start selling DAOos as a SaaS, …
