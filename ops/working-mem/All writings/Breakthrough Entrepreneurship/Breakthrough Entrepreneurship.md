## What is breakthrough entrepreneurship?

What would the world have looked like if Edison stopped trying to create a lightbulb after 20 tries, instead of the 2,774 attempts it took to arrive at the bamboo filament that made his light bulbs a commercial success? Or what if Ford would’ve accepted the common idea at the time that “automobiles are for the rich only” and wouldn’t have pushed to simplify production lines - eventually leading to the model T of which 15 million were sold & became a symbol of liberation for the expanding middle class? Or what if Brian Chesky & the Airbnb gang would’ve given up after hearing from some well meaning investor that “people are never going to stay in other people’s homes”?

Breakthrough Entrepreneurship is, before anything - a decision. After that decision, it is about being non-consensus & right.

- A consensus, right business is something we know will work, like a bakery. These are proven business models. There’s no real breakthrough. If you ask a 100 people whether somebody who will start a bakery on a busy street will be able to give their business a fair shot - 99 will say yes. The main thing that these consensus, right business often have a lot of - is direct competition. That’s why a lot of startups are consensus, right businesses. They’re innovating at the margins, not at the core.
- A consensus, wrong business is a business that everybody agrees on is a bad idea & when executed effectively turns out to be a bad idea. Simple as that.
- Then there’s non-consensus, wrong & right. This is where we enter breakthrough territory. This is where we’re attempting to innovate at the core. When we ask a 100 people whether our idea will work, 90 might say no. The tricky part about this, is that you probably won’t know for a long time whether you’re right or wrong. For Edison, it was 2773 attempts of not being sure. And this is where I want to share a trick on how to think in a way that you can be more right.

## How to be non-consensus, right?

This is where I can share a useful mental model. It has its roots in linear algebra - don't worry, you don't have to know any. I will try my best at explaining it in super simple terms. There's basically 3 concepts you need - well actually 4, let me start with the most basic one: a vector. A vector is basically a line in space that has a orientation & a length.

Before you go further here - highly, highly recommend watching this video by 3blue1brown who explains this a million times better than I ever could: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA)

### useful concept 1: vectors

This vector v can be described in terms of it's "basis vectors" x & y. Basis vectors is concept number two i'm trying to help you with here.  
![[Pasted image 20230220212521.png]]  

### useful concept 2: basis vectors

Basis vectors are cool as you can decide on any 3 lines with a particular direction - you just have to make all of them cross over in one point and boom, you can describe any point according in a 3D space according to those 3 lines.

In the example above, we can describe the purple arrow in terms of the basis vector x & basis vector y.

### useful concept 3: (basis vector) transformations

A basis vector transformation is when you decide to change or "transform" 1 or all of the "basis vectors". This means that the points that you used to describe with x & y - you now describe with x & u, where "u" is another "line" that has been "linearly transformed" from "y".

This is kinda crazy as this changes the entire vector space - so it might very well be that the vector (0,1) in the x & y basis vector space doesn't decribe the same point in absolute space as the vector (0,1) does in the x & u basis vector space.

If this doesn't make sense, don't worry I'm gonna clear it all up w an example soon!

### useful concept 4: eigen vectors

Our final really cool concept are eigen vectors. Eigen vecotors are vectors that, within the transformation of one set of basis vectors to the new ones, don't get knocked of their span. In simple, but mathemtically questionable terms, these are vectors that within the transformation are transformed onto themselves. So this means that point (0,1) remains point (0,1) despite the transformation. (Math geeks, I know this isn't exaclty true but this is true enough for me to make my further points.)

Again, highly encourage you to watch the 3blue1brown video as he explains it better than I ever could.

Anyway - we've got our concepts, now let me talk you through how I use these to think about building non-consensus, right things.

## Breakthrough entrepreneurship is about working on the eigen vector problems

With our quick linear algebra primer behind us, it's time to yield our new power.

Let's say our current world has certain basis vectors determining how our world operates. There's a regulatory basis vector that's pointing in a certain direction, there's a technological one and then there's a societal one. We can describe the current global landscape on the basis of these basis vectors.

Now, one of the basis vectors is transformed: for example the technological one. Technological forces are clearly changing world - but how to know what to work on. That's when we call upon our eigen vectors. A way that we can find our eigen vectors within the transformation is to ask ourselves the question: what won't change?

> To find the eigen vector, ask the question: "What won't change?"

For example: transportation. People will always need mobility and will always want it better, faster & cheaper. The problem is the same, the way we solve it changed from first with horses, then with cars & now we do it with an app.

## My example: Eden Protocol

## In conclusion

Breakthrough entrepreneurship is about being non-consensus right. And the way to be non-consensus right is to work on the eigenvector problems - that implies that you understand the basis vectors at play really well and can clearly articulate a thesis around what won't change.
