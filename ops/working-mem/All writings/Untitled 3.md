  

I love getting the most out of talented, high-performing people & I have a fat-double T profile - meaning I can tell what good looks like in any function + jump in and do an above average job in most roles (i.e. there's nothing I can't do - code, design, sell, setup partnerships, market) and have superpowers in selling & building.

I've never worked for anyone directly, have always had my own businesses but you guys are one of the few that I'd love to work for.

What’s the most impressive thing you’ve built

In 2017, I launched a campus wide impactcoin. Essentially this was an app built in flutter - where the only thing you could do was vote to lower the temperature in the classroom. I used a geofence to calculate whether there was consesus that the temperature should be lowered. If there was, the temperature was lowered & everyone that voted to lower the temperature was paid an impactcoin. The market cap of that impactcoin was then equal to what the uni was able to save over a 6-month period of time. I.e. $100 save = 200 Impactcoins distributed = every impact coin = $0.5

Also, when covid hit - I hacked together a tele-health triage service with a friend & convinced 1000+ medical students to volunteer.

  

Most impossible thing you’ve achieved?

I dropped out of my masters in Computer Science at 21 to build + scale my HR-innovation agency ( [https://humain.ai](https://humain.ai/) ) where I lead many projects ranging from implementing AI to predicting employee churn to anticipating skill demand based on market trends for multinationals & EU-level government orgs. Getting those contracts required breaking into network events I wasn’t invited to & outselling established players such as Deloitte & Accenture at 1/5 the experience of some of the partners I was up against. I sold this agency at 25 (i.e. the methods & client portfolio I developed). I did all this while having become a dad at 19 to a daughter that lived on the other side of the world.

Or the pre-seed we raised for our crypto startup right after FTX collapsed.

  

one social system that you hacked

While I was president of a student NGO called Academics for Development, I was warned by my predecessors that because of the fact that this is an NGO, motivation of the 150 members often drops in month 3.

I got ahead of this by in our starting-retreat leading everyone into an exercise called "the 3 most important questions" - in that, everybody basically thinks about & writes down what they want out of life, how they want to contribute to the world & how they want to grow. Then I got everyone to send this in & we had a shared drive where you could look up everyone else's 3 most important questions.

Whenever I noticed somebody slacking or getting de-motivated, I'd look up what they wrote down and either had a conversation with them on how the work they're currently doing helps them before it helps the org. Whenever there was a birthday, I'd buy a small gift (book,...) that would show that I read their doc + made them realise that I cared personally. This meant that now they weren't doing things just for an org, but also for me - someone who really, actually cares about them and their dreams.

We 7x'd revenue + launched more net new initiatives in comparison to previously most successful "admin" of the ngo.
