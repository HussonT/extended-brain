# Eden announces magic job-board for online communities geared to help web3 orgs hire value aligned talent, faster.

## Especially in web3, figuring out the credibility & abilities behind the discord, telegram or twitter pfps can be hard. Eden operates as the community super-connector who brings together the right person with the right opportunity for the right reasons.

What would the world look like if we all loved our work? That’s a key question that Eden Protocol is aiming to answer by building tools that help more people be the right person on the right project for the right reasons. Their first product, Eden’s magic job board, aims to build a better talent match rooted in the pre-existing sense of context, trust & belonging that exists in online-communities.

  

Finding great talent in the web3 space is especially hard because it’s a nascent space with a reputation that is volatile. Clearly, the established talent acquisition channels like LinkedIn aren’t as effective. Add to that this space is default global & lives mostly in online group chats behind pseudonymous profile pictures and finding your next great web3 aligned frontend developer can seem like an insurmountable task.

  

Most of the space’s talent is active in online communities where they gather to find & create opportunities. Eden’s magic job-board thoughtfully opens up these online-communities as a better alternative to existing talent acquisition channels. Its AI helps talent understand what their chances with each opportunity are while the community-powered multi-player referral mechanism helps hiring managers understand a talent’s credibility & reputation. This eliminates the cumbersome work needed to do first-line vetting & sourcing completely and helps hiring managers focus on building a team that outperforms rather than compromises.

  

> We believe that community plays a key part in finding & doing work you love, which is why we aim to become an unmissable part of any online-community stack.

Eden’s magic job-board allows any community to monetise access to their talent base by letting any hiring manager/recruiter post a job to their community. After clicking “post a job” on the community job board, a hiring manager simply copy/pastes their job description from which Eden then generates a beautifully designed opportunity landing page. From that job description a bunch of score topics & seed questions for a first interview are automatically generated that the hiring manager can choose to edit.

They can then choose to publish the opportunity to the community for a fee that goes directly towards the community. Once they publish the opportunity it is sent out to the talent that Eden already “knows” could be a great fit. If Eden doesn’t have information that the hiring manager would like to know, Eden invites talent to answer the open questions that haven’t been addressed & pre-drafts some of the questions with the information she already has on behalf of the talent - for their review of-course.

At any point can people who haven’t been interviewed by Eden yet apply to the open-role by taking an opportunity specific interview. Eden increases the chances of getting invited for a live interview by helping talent hit on everything the hiring manager wants to know and avoids time-wasting intro calls that would’ve gone nowhere on both ends.

By capturing some of the key information that you would share again and again on these intro calls & layering in the community verification & context of the community values & norms your chances of finding your perfect fit as a hiring manager increase dramatically. In short, less time applying & more time shining for talent. Less time reviewing applications, more time building value aligned teams without compromise for hiring manager & for communities finally a business models that aligns with the continued growth for rather than extraction from your community members.

  

> As the culture-queen, Eden makes it so easy to find even more culture aligned people without having to jump on 100s of introductory calls that are a waste of time for both parties.
