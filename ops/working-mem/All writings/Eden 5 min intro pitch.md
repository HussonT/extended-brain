Okay so I’ll quickly paint a picture of what we’re building & why it matters and then I’ll speak to why I’m now building this.

We’ve built a tool for communities to vet, manage & monetise their talent pool. On top of that tool we’re building a blockchain network with rich & peer-validated talent data that makes it possible for an ecosystem of AI-hiring agents to refer. Myosin.xyz, a marketing dao with a 2% acceptance rate, has onboarded a new cohort of social media managers by having each candidate do an AI-interview + gotten peers to do a staked vouch in-order to get in, powered by our tool.

We all know that companies are becoming smaller, which means the cost of getting the wrong person is proportionally bigger as is the opportunity cost that comes with keeping a seat empty for longer. A faster, better match won’t come from AI that can automate LinkedIn conversations, that’s basically coming up with faster horses. What we need is a car, and that looks like trustworthy AI that refers talent.

The main difference between recruit & refer is that recruit is often about a high-noise numbers game while AI that refers is a high-signal matching game. Having AI play that numbers game exponentially increases noise which dramatically lowers response rates which keeps increasing the cost to find a good match, fast - we’re already seeing this play out in all of today’s corporate networks.

So we asked ourselves the question what would a network look like that would enable & reward AI to play that thoughtful matching game?

If you think about what makes a referral work in people it’s two things: deep context & staked credibility. The better I know the person & the better I know the company I’m referring them to, the better I can match. Then there’s staked credibility - when I’m referring I am basically staking my social capital. If I’m referring a bad candidate that’s going to reflect badly on me, which means I’m only doing it when I’m pretty convinced there’s a good match.

Scaling the level of deep context & staked credibility per talent are the two pillars upon which we’re building the Eden network. We’re scaling context by on the one hand building a network for AI-agents rather than for people, because people will never read 400-pages about a talent but AI will

On the other hand we’ve built a staked vouching mechanism that rewards people for meaningfully vouching for each-other by entitling vouchers to vouchee’s part of their hiring bounty. These vouchers can be people, DAOs and even institutions & tomorrow will very likely also be joined by vouching-agents - making the hiring signals we use today like what university you went to or whether you worked at FAANG less one-size-fits-all & a lot more granular.

Where this all lead to? Well we see a global talent coordination protocol that turns the web into a lush garden of opportunities & powers everything from a slack-plugin that lets you instantly find a contractor that will vibe with your company culture & has done the thing you’re trying to do to a custom in-house AI-VR avatar that is present on every staffing call in an enterprise & can tap into the Eden network to instantly fill staffing gaps.

  

So why did I move from Belgium to spend 14h/day in a founder residency called brickyard in Chattanooga, Tennessee, away from all the noise to build that network?

There’s two big reasons: When I was in high school, I came across this statistic that said that 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work. That spun me into a full-blown existential crisis. Every side project that I’ve launched since of which 4 turned into startups & one got sold in 2021 had to do in some, way, shape or form with helping people be on the right project for the right reasons.

The second big reason: I know about cars. I have a background in CS & dropped out of my masters because the agency I’d started on the side took off. In that agency I helped multinationals as well as European government agencies how to leverage AI to get more out of people. For example: I worked on an internal AI talent-matching engine - the problem however was that people are really bad at assessing their own skills, so we allowed for peers to write referrals for eachother that we tried taking into account - but people kept being vague or untruthfull for all sorts of reasons but mainly because they had nothing to lose & everything to gain by lying. This is an experience

I worked on projects such as using AI to predict employee churn & anticipate the next set of skill needs based on market trends. That’s where I ran into all of the limitations of AI when it comes to dealing with talent - limitations that I know can be overcome with a well designed network on crypto rails.

Before I go any further - would love to know if there’s anything you guys would love to double click on!
