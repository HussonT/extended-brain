## Background summary

I earned a Bachelor’s and Master’s in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering in 2017 from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. My next step was to start a Ph.D. in Computer Vision at the University of Bristol, UK. I founded Neralabs, a company that specializes in creating algorithms to assist and enhance day trading on the New York Stock Exchange. After that, I became a Senior Data Scientist at Congruity 360, based in New York, where I created algorithmic tools to sort through billions of documents. Subsequently, I was a Machine Learning Team Leader at 10Clouds, based in Warsaw, where I built the company’s whole Machine Learning Team from scratch. I went on to be a co-owner and CTO of Finseka, a Fintech company in Krakow, Poland. There, I developed a platform to connect agents, mortgage brokers, and clients. Finally, I worked at Goldman Sachs, again in New York, as a Knowledge Graph Engineer, developing tools to connect tens of thousands of employees in an intracompany network focused on novel ideas and support.

  

## **What personal academic or professional achievement are you most proud of?**

I am really proud of my first attempt to innovate publicly. After years of Machine Learning development and Computer Vision research, I wanted to have a true impact on the world. I took on the mission to help visually-impaired and completely blind people, so I spent a lot of time in centers for the visually impaired in order to deeply grasp their problems and find the best possible way to maximize positive impact in their lives.The result was a device of my own creation: glasses with a micro camera and Bluetooth speaker. In addition, I created an algorithm that could read books through the camera and narrate them via the speaker, when a user holds the book in front of him in the natural position for reading.After months of development, I finally had the opportunity to showcase my work. It was an incredible journey talking to so many people who would benefit from this invention, as was publishing a paper about it, which I presented at the June 2018 IEEE conference in Seattle.This was years ago, but I am still proud of this experience; it showed me what it means to find the right people to serve, to do user research, and to build a product and publish it.

## **Describe an instance where you demonstrated exceptional creativity or perseverance.**

An instance that comes to mind is when my cofounder and I realized that getting traditional funding is not the only way to build a company and assemble an amazing, excited team to build the future of work in Web3 with us. The completely unconstrained thinking that DAOs unlocked for us, especially when it comes to talent, has felt like “unchartered territory,” despite being self-funded until now. Navigating so much uncharted territory has required deep perseverance & creativity from us as we work to bring our vision to fruition.My co-founder and I decided to spend time in Bankless DAO and Developer DAO, respectively, in order to understand this world and how it works. Without such an understanding, we wouldn’t be able to provide meaningful value to the Web3 community. Only two months later, we were able to launch Eden as a POC in Developer DAO. The launch was a huge success because of the deep connections we’ve built with members of the community and that our bot fills a huge need in the space.  After the launch, we’ve got over a 100 people applying to join Eden, despite us being unable to offer any financial compensation whatsoever. Ultimately, we decided to stick with 25 amazing members, organized into 6 teams (FrontEnd, BackEnd, Blockchain, Design, Grants, BotDevelopment). All of our pro bono work led to us getting the biggest grant in D_D for their season 1, which we will have access to only 2 months after our team of 25 came together to build the MVP. Keeping the team engaged & productive required incredible moments of perseverance and creativity because we realized that it was next to impossible to coordinate everyone - given that our team operates out of several different time zones. We need to make sure that our contributors have everything they need to work at whatever hours they work. Doing so translated into multiple all-nighters to ensure that the backend was usable, while also continuing to call & coordinate with everyone during the day. This was a very difficult task. Keeping everyone personally engaged also requires us to deeply understand each individual team member and create a supportive environment for them, where they can grow individually and move Eden forward as a team in sync. The fact that we were able to get to MVP in a month with 25 people who were strangers blows my mind.

Right now, we are in an incredible place, where every member is truly dedicated to the team. Most spend between 10 and 40+ hours/week with us.
