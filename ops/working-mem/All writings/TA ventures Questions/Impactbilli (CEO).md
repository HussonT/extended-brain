    ## A**cademic and professional background.**
    
    During a 2-year stint of travel after high school, I deepened my passion for problem-solving & creation - I knew I wanted to be nothing but a Founder. While on the road in late 2015, an idea for a geo-location-based skill-finding app called TMWRK led me to write my first business plan - a 200-page monstrosity for which I flew home to dramatically drop on a befriended investor’s desk. He understandably laughed me out of the room, which drove me, despite having no money to speak of, to assemble a team of 4 people to build the app with me. Frustrated by my inability to build and drive the project forward, faster - I decided to study computer science at KU Leuven in 2015. There, I fell in love with the potential, society-wide impact of paradigm-shifting technologies like AI & blockchain.
    
      
    
    Even though that first app failed, I kept launching business ideas throughout the course of my studies. The most notable of those attempts was perspektiv.ai, a talent-matching platform that used AI to match students to internships that were tangential to their field of study. In 2019 I dropped out of my CS master’s program to pursue what culminated in a 10-person digital innovation consultancy, called [www.humain.ai](http://www.humain.ai/). We helped clients such as the 3 EU institutions, multinationals & BEL20 companies figure out how to best leverage emerging technologies to get the right person in the right place for the right reasons. I sold this agency 9 months ago after realizing that it was not the way for me to achieve my life’s goal: to become [someone with the skill, heart & mindset to positively impact 1 billion lives](https://www.theimpactbillionaires.com/). Since getting involved with blockchain and web3 in 2017 (I built an impact coin on top of my own blockchain that helped my uni save on its heating bill), I’ve seen the impact, innovations and potential of the space grow; it was an easy decision to jump headlong into the space. At Entrepreneur First ([www.joinef.com](http://www.joinef.com/)), an incubator/accelerator in London, I met my co-founder. Since then, we’ve literally moved in together and have been building Eden for the last 6 months, non-stop.
    
    ## What personal academic or professional achievement are you most proud of?
    
    I’m proud to always live close to my values. By outside standards, I was running a super-successful agency at the age of 25, was making good money etc. but I didn’t feel like I was really growing anymore. I’m proud of myself for having been able to sell & start from scratch. Which makes me even more proud of what we’ve been able to do over the last 6 months. We’ve grown Eden from a team of 2 founders to a team of 25 in less than a month, despite having 0 funding. With Eden, I’m most proud of the culture we are creating and the impact our protocol will unleash. When we deployed our alpha in Developer_DAO it felt like seeing my kid take its first steps.
    
    ## Describe an instance where you demonstrated exceptional creativity or perseverance.
    
    My answer is both an instance and an ongoing process - it is the relationship I’ve built and am developing with my daughter. While in Tucson, Arizona, traveling away from my native Belgium, I had a one-night stand with a woman, 10 years my senior, from a different culture. My world got shaken pretty hard when that encounter led to my daughter being born 9 months later. At 19 years-old, I was focused on building something with massive impact, and, as a child of divorce, I had also sworn to never put my kids through growing up with split or misaligned parents. A huge part of me wanted to be in Tucson with my daughter, but I felt that moving away from the assets and potential to fulfill my ambitions in Belgium would force me to become 1/1000th of the person I know I can and want to be. Starting over in a foreign city that has the ambition of a brick wall would do a disservice to everyone, so I decided I wouldn’t choose; I would do everything in my power both to have an amazing relationship with my daughter and to become the best version of myself.
    
      
    
    There were times when I had no clue what I was doing, where everyone around me doubted my choices, when my “ambitious projects” - the reason I was, black on white, choosing not to be with my daughter - felt like they were failing miserably, and where I was struggling to figure out how I was going to pay rent. I persevered. On both fronts. There isn’t a birthday party I’ve missed, a month I haven’t paid alimony or a week I haven’t called. Scarlett is 5 now & we talk for hours on the phone - I know who her friends are, what her favorite food is, and what’s going on in her life. She calls me when she’s sad, when she’s happy, and she calls me daddy. I’m proud to be her dad and of the founder I am today.
    
      
    
    Being a present father & building the agency I sold at 25 didn’t happen overnight or without growing pains. Making my vision happen, especially since nobody, including Scarlett’s mom,  believed I could, took 6 years’s worth of perseverance and grit. Now, as Eden comes into fruition as a fully-remote, global protocol , it won’t matter anymore that Tucson has the ambition of a brick wall. I can build from anywhere in the world, so why not do it close to my daughter for at least a couple of months a year :)
