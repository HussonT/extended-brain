GM GM D_D - we‚Äôve been working HARD over the last couple of months. However, we haven‚Äôt been as diligent as we would‚Äôve want to be in keeping everyone here solidly in the loop. For S2 - that‚Äôs something we want to change. From this week on you can expect a bi-weekly update on this channel from Eden.

In that spirit, let us catch you up high-level on what‚Äôs been happening over the last 5 months since August! (There‚Äôs been sooooooo much more happening than what‚Äôs reflected here today - but we‚Äôve got to start somewhere right ;) )

- August:
    - D_D grants our grant - we‚Äôre overjoyed at this vote of confidence from the community!
    - We continue building the team and have over 50 applications of members to join Eden.
    - We have a huge realisation that we‚Äôve jumped with both feet into the ‚Äúbuild trap‚Äù of thinking we need a fully functioning product to start testing it.
    - We start ‚Äúalpha-testing‚Äù - which are discovery calls on ‚Äúflows‚Äù of the product - so not fully finished flows. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably been on one of these because we did more than 150 of these calls over the last 5 months.
    - We hold bi-weekly game-nights that are just too much fun
    - The partnership & outreach team forms & start applying to a key grants - we‚Äôve built a master grant application that we use to start applying to grants programs that align with our values & to communities that we feel could really use us.
        - One of those grants/communities is Ocean DAO. We meet amazing people there and find a lot of amazing support quickly there.
        - AIgovera is one of these communities too.
    - Alex helps us launch the alpha Bot in D_D
- September:
    - We launch our Gitcoin grant - with 273 donors we gladly speak of a success!
        - We make this fun little video for the grant: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHqpZ1_fCtw&t=7s&ab_channel=EdenProtocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHqpZ1_fCtw&t=7s&ab_channel=EdenProtocol)
    - One of our favourite mantras, hack value before you hack growth, comes to concrete fruition: we continue building - the dev team really picks up steam - at this point we‚Äôre testing 3 new features a week as we make the key realisation of switching from optimising for speed of delivery to optimising for speed of iteration & hypothesis testing.
    - We upgrade the v1 of the knowledge graph with the help of WiseTy & Bluepanda to a way more complex & sophisticated version.
    - We transition to typescript under the leadership of waxy
- Octomber:
    - Most of Oktober was spent heads down building, iterating, doing calls, redesigning the product, building it again, getting on calls again, ‚Ä¶
    - Impactbilli went to Devcon & met with old & new Eden frens ü´∂
    - We are approached by mutliple other project who are interested in using the Eden talent search & matching protocols in their own projects, validating the need for these tools outside of DAOs.
    - We design a broader go-to-market strategy to flywheel Eden beyond D_D that involves hackathons, DAOs & Protocols.
- November:
    - Part of the Eden team meets at ETHLisbon!
    - A lot of amazing new connections are formed IRL here as well - a lot of inbound interest in Eden.
    - Bluepanda breaks his back surfing in Lisbon :(
    - Despite blue‚Äôs pain & drastically having reduced mobility we Designs a v2 of the AI & Knowledge graph that is exponential in complexity & sophistication.
    - Despite approaching the end of the year - the Eden team moves full steam ahead & keeps building, measuring & learning
- December
    - The partnership & outreach team receives a boost as we test how viable our new go-to-market strategy would be if we attempted to launch it: we test demand for what we‚Äôre building with Protocols, hackathons & other DAOs - we end up with a waiting list of new DAOs, hackathons & protocols who have committed to launching on/with Eden.
    - Everything understandably kind of slows down a bit around Christmas
    - Development keeps moving forward - we‚Äôre getting closer & closer to having a fully standalone beta for both Hackathons & DAOs.
- January
    - Finalising a lot of the details we need to iron out before the private beta launch in D_D
    - Getting ready to launch the beta in the coming weeks in D_D
    - Upgraded the AI to v2.1 to include expertise level on the skill level
    - Prep test-net version of Token
