There’s no doubt about it, the times - they are a-changin’. I’m not going to lie to you - I’ve had a bit of existential angst creep up on me over the last couple of months. Everything is changing so fast - is the work I’m doing still going to be impactful 3 months from now? What about 10 years from now?

We humans aren’t wired for these exponentially accelerating change-times. And yet, here we are.

Let me tell you, then, how I pull myself out of this existential dread: I ask myself what I believe won’t change - and double down on that. For me that comes down to doing work I love, with people I admire. If that’s the same for you, read on!

My co-founder & I started Eden Protocol with the insight that the way we organise work is long overdue a big upgrade from our industrial revolution way of working. We started this opportunity to rethink work with the question: “what would our world look like if everybody got to make work, work for them - instead of the other way around?” With a recent study showing that globally on [average only 23% of people are emotionally engaged at work](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/506798/globally-employees-engaged-stressed.aspx), it was clear to us that our current model for work, isn’t working.

## 23% work-engagement isn’t great

And if you look at the foundations of our current model for work, this makes a ton of sense. Most of the education systems across the globe have been influenced by the Prussian education system. The Prussian education system, developed in the 18th and 19th centuries, aimed to shape students into disciplined, obedient - allow me to say - **mindless** individuals who could serve the state and its military needs. The Prussian model emphasized rote memorization, standardized testing, and a hierarchical structure with strict discipline.

The thinking at the time was that this approach would create a well-ordered society with a clear hierarchy and defined roles for individuals. This was great to produce obedient factory workers people like Frederick Taylor introduced “Scientific Management Principles” that used stopwatches & best practices to keep everyone drumming to the same, **certain** beat. High certainty through very **rigid** process & adherence to those processes are the seed of the way we currently organise most of the world of work.

Back to how the times they are exponentially a-changin’. If you want certainty & top-down, rigid structure in the world of the internet, unbannable bitcoin & game-stop rallying crowd power - good luck. We’re a very long way from the certainty-centric, 40 year-ladder climbing career with for example [millenials changing job every 2.75 years on average](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7012-millennial-job-hopping.html). And signs show this isn’t about to slow down with by the year [2027 more than 50% of the US workforce projected to freelance](https://www.allworknow.com/majority-workforce-will-freelance-2027/).

Engaging work doesn’t mix well with mindless, certain & rigid. That begs the question, how can we leverage the new internet paradigm to build a world in which work can be engaging by default: in short, what would internet work you love look like?

## The essence of great work

Let’s start with the “why”, the essence of impactful work. Who better to sum up what impactful work is than a man who has deeply touched the lives of so many through his personal work and the work he inspired: Steve Jobs.

This e-mail of Steve Jobs to himself captures the essence of impactful work so well. What ties all meaningful work together is that no matter how big or small your contribution to the end result, it’s useful to somebody beyond yourself.

## The value of loving your work

The value of finding & doing work you love is that it brings you more joy & meaning which allows you to effortlessly do it better. Better work leads to more value created for other people as well as yourself. This leads to more effective & profitable companies but also general higher well being. Getting the right person on the right project for the right reasons is not only the “right” thing to do - it is also the financially sound thing to do.

If the whole world would love what they do we’d live in a world where your spouse comes home energised & full of stories, your parents have excess energy to grow & inspire you and conversations with friends are filled with shiny eyes & deep immersion in each others’ joy. That’s a society I’d sign to live in.

Why, then, wouldn’t you strive to do great work you can love? So now that we have the opportunity to completely rethink the way we work, why not design our labor allocation tools to make that the default.

## Ok but how?

I think it’s pretty dang simple: we have to get the right person on the right project for the right reasons and our current way of getting work organised isn’t working, so we need a better way. We are building that better way. A way that is built for the internet workforce who wants to make work, work for them instead of the other way around.
