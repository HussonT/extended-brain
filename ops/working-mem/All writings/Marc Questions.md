### I know this might be oversimplifying but how accurate/inaccurate is it to call what you're doing "page rank for people"? I'm mainly thinking about how the story will get conveyed to other people.

- That’s definitely the core idea behind what we’re building. We use many different forms of backlinks that can be used to generate a credibility score on a per skill basis which in turn can be leveraged for a relevance score in regards to a talent-query.

- Some of those backlink examples:
    - One of our insights is that there will be more and more on-chain reputation markers such as on & off-chain verifiable credential such as Diploma’s, Soul-bound tokens, etc. Those are ideal credibility backlinks.
    - AI makes a lot of on & off-chain reputation-markers relevant in understanding somebody’s credibility around a topic. For example: how relevant is this person’s side project to me looking for somebody who can help me develop a recommendation algo for my pet-food marketplace? We use GPT & GCNN’s that map how much more credible that makes somebody’s skill & how much more relevant that makes them to the query.
    - The ability for people with merit to endorse in a way that is highly trustable as they have skin in the game for their endorsement through our tokenomics. For example a senior machine learning engineers endorsement of a junior ML engineer should mean more than his mom endorsing him. Embedding this socio-economic layer into the algo is something that is only meaningfully possible with web3 tech and a very powerful credibility back-link.
    - Can go deeper on that if you like :)

### What is your personal experience that makes you want to take on this project? Is there a personal experience that motivates you? What inspired you to commit your time/life to this?

- **For Tom**: Two big drivers for me: 1. Acquire the skill, heart & mindset to impact a billion+ people’s lives positively. 2. Empower people to do what they love.
    - Personal growth saved my life. I became a dad at 19 after having had a one night stand and I had no idea how I was going to deal with it. It came to a point where I was actively thinking about taking my life. Until one night I was done wallowing in self-pity and was going to climb out of this pit. I got obsessed with expanding my emotional & intellectual tools. 3 years after that one night I had a bachelors in Computer Science, was launching my first company, 6 years later sold that company, have a great relationship with my daughter despite her living on the other side of the world and so this life-goal of acquiring the skill, heart & mindset to impact a billion+ people’s lives positively reflects that deep hunger & need to keep learning & growing. I’ve found no better environment to grow in than the environment that comes with building a business from scratch. It is also the most effective tool to impact a billion+ people’s lives.
    - Why this problem specifically?
        - If you want to impact a billion+ people’s lives positively, you have to tackle a big problem. I believe the biggest hidden problem of our society today is the fact that 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work. Not only is that costing us around 7 trillion in lost productivity globally every year, It’s a clear sign that work isn’t working for us and that we’re keeping a system in place that creates outcomes that serve very few people in terms of life-satisfaction & opportunities to grow. I’ve been obsessed with helping the world move from a “shuffle” economy to a “purpose” economy. That’s why I’ve been launching skill & talent related startups since 2016. My first startup was TMWRK - a geolocation based skill finder. Second startup was -perspektiv - an AI-driven talent matching platform for internships. All of the startups I’ve launched, including this one, have a central question: how can we get the right person on the right project for the right reasons.
- **For Blue**:
    - I am extremely motivated to build Eden Protocol with Tom because it is both intellectually and emotionally inspiring. The idea of connecting graph convolutional neural networks, blockchain, and full stack product development has captivated me for many years and I believe that this project has the potential to have an incredible impact by connecting all 3.
    - My personal experience at Goldman Sachs, where I felt emotionally disengaged from my work, has further fueld my desire to create an environment where individuals can thrive and feel engaged and excited about their work. I believe that eden has the potential to achieve this on a large scale.
    - Ultimately, my life goal is to make a positive impact on the lives of billions of people and I believe that the eden protocol is a step towards achieving this. The talent search protocol has the potential to impact every person who will have an occupation in the future and this is what inspires me to commit my time and life to this project.
- As you can see, we found each-other in this common love for growth & impact ;)

### What is the dynamic among the team? What makes the team work well and what are some of the holes that need to be filled?

- Blue & I operate as yin & yang. I am a conceptual executing-thinker, blue is a pragmatic thinking-executer. Where I lack - Blue fills the hole & vice-versa. Blue is an incredible leader who can make literally any team outperform. Where blue provides the raw execution power, I provide strategic & tactical vision.
- **On a personal level** - we’re able to have all the difficult conversations with extreme efficacy & high degrees of emotional intelligence. We have certain “processes” in place that keep us aligned and accountable to each-other - such as every week we set aside a 1-hour conversation to talk about how each helped & hurt the business. We also just really, deeply respect and admire each other for our complementary skill sets. Everything I’m not so good at, Blue is an absolute genius at. We’re maximally different without losing very important, solid common ground.
- **On the broader team level** - we’re able to attract a lot (we’ve had over 150 contributors apply to work on Eden through Developer DAO in the last months.) because we execute. People love to bet on winners & when the train is leaving the station, people hop on. We’ve got team-building & getting those teams to execute down.
- **Holes to be filled**: From a product POV we’ve got everything we need in-house. From technical ability to execute with blockchain & AI to relevant experience exploring the “idea-maze” around effective talent matching. As we scale & refine our tech, where we definitely could use help is the legal & day-to-day operational side of things. Neither of us are very detail oriented.

### I came across this: https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-talent-coordination-bot-proposal-soil-unlock-community-powered-opportunity-s1-budget-application/2195 Can you help me understand what has taken place since this time both on the project progress and the team composition?

- I think if you want an in-depth picture, the most complete will be to take a look at the follow up proposal to that proposal which we released a couple of days ago: [https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-s2-eden-proposal-4-tracks-to-join-stay-play-in-d-d/2624](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-s2-eden-proposal-4-tracks-to-join-stay-play-in-d-d/2624)
- To give you the TL;DR here -
    - Team is divided in core, solid & liquid
        1. Core contributors are full-time Eden members. (currently 5)
        2. Solid contributors are members who can spend 10-15 hours a week building with us. (currently 10)
        3. Liquid contributors are members who are interested in exploring if Eden would be a place for them and would work more on a bounty per bounty case. (varies between 5 and 15 at any given time)
    - Product
        - We did over 150 user-discovery calls with our product-alpha. Those insights are all being packaged in a beta that facilitates effective talent search & matching in the DAOs (where for D_D we’ve outlined 4 specific use-cases/user stories - namely project/talent matching, mentoring, hackathons & Eden’s SEEDS-program) being released in the coming weeks.
        - A slightly adapted version of that product is being used to help with team formation for hackathons - this is of specific interest to protocols who want to incentivise builders to build on top of their stack.

### What are some of the traits that make you really hard to compete with?

- Network effects + non-skeuomorphic way of looking at the problem:
    - As we provide the most relevant & complete search, everyone with a project will come to Eden to find talent which in turn attracts all the talent as they are being found for the projects that they want to be found for. As you build your reputation both on the talent & project side more and more, the Eden network becomes more and more sticky and people will start optimising their profiles across the web to be discoverable through Eden - like SEO for talent.
    - Eden is the easiest, most relevant place to make your reputational capital count in your search for opportunities and/or talent. It’s great to have a bunch of verifiable credentials but if they’re not helping you get better opportunities, they’re worthless. Also just showcasing them on a linkedin style page, isn’t enough. It’s what they do for your relevant discoverability for the right kind of projects/jobs that really matters. This focus & strategy serves us similar to how the best search served google:
        - A key differentiator is that you do not need to have an account on Eden to be discoverable on Eden, just like you don’t need to upload your website to google to be discoverable on google. The open nature of blockchains makes it possible for these on-chain verifiable credentials to be searchable without a user needing to be signed up to the Eden network. All the other (skeuomorphic) strategies are focussed on creating two sided marketplaces and balancing those out, slapping an incentive layer on open roles and/or owning the credentialing/attestation layer in the hope to become the single source of truth (classic web2 data play - which won’t work on an open blockchain & what’s the point of putting it on chain if you’re going to keep it private). One of our non-skeuomorphic insight is: On a blockchain, you don’t need to “own” the data to meaningfully search the data. “the basket of eggs” are already scattered across the web, we’re just giving the “chickens” the tools to make them hatch.
- Right timing of key technologies maturing & Founder’s edges to take advantage of that:
    - For Tom: Having founded multiple companies around skills & talent - clearly understanding what the missing pieces are when it comes to making talent search & matching - both from a social as well as a technical perspective. These missing pieces are only being addressed in a meaningful way today with LLM’s like GPT opening their APIs, Blockchain’s maturing in scalability & an accelerated move to a new world of work, catalysed by covid.
    - For Blue: AI-PhD experience + Blockchain dev experience + experience w the talent matching problem at scale in a big org like Goldman Sachs from a GCNN perspective give us insight into the technical nuance of evaluating skills, skill levels & the broader context around what makes a useful technical evaluation of that skill.
- Developer DAO Community Edge:
    - Being born in Developer DAO we have a community of 5000 active devs & 20 000 “lurking” devs & 80.000 (twitter followers) dev_dao interested people rooting for us + serving as a highly sought after initial talent base that Eden will make accessible to the outside world immediately.
    - A lot of talent-marketplaces fail to get off the ground at the chicken & egg problem - we have a basket full of eggs that are actively building our tool with us to help them hatch. And once we do it for one community, we can do it for every community. This community edge is a great “network effect” hack.
    - Our strategy of going from DAO to DAO is similar to how Facebook went from uni campus to uni campus. We can build atomic networks that bleed over into other networks easily.
- Protocol + network strategy
    - By building an Eden native active network of talent that is by default easily searchable with Eden tools, any project that integrates Eden protocol tools immediately has access to active talent & a relevant way to match them to their project.
- This might sound cheesy, but we will outwork & outgrow anybody and are unbreakable as a team.
    - We’re moving to Chattanooga for at least a year here to do nothing but build: [www.justlaybrick.com](http://www.justlaybrick.com) - We are beyond dedicated to this. This is our life. Neither of us have a life outside of Eden.
    - We are both obsessed with our personal growth. This bleeds into the team and makes us hyper resilient and striving for the next level relentlessly & consistently.

### What is something outside of the company's control that could wildly impact the outcome both positively and negatively?

- Positively:
    - The general trend towards freelance & polywork accelerates with Eden as the best tool to find the best fitting talent & the most exciting projects. Eden creates an entire new work-category: the liquid workforce.
    - A web3 bull run - DAOs become a huge thing as they sustain meaningful growth & fully mature in large part thanks to our tool.
    - GPT completely resets consumer behaviour & expectations around how we search for things which makes the current way of looking for talent feel even more archaic - kind of like going to the library before the google search-bar.
- Negatively:
    
    - We all collectively decide we want 40 year careers for the same employer again - (even tho, Eden can then still be used as an internal resource allocation tool)
        - Nobody needs to do work anymore
        - An asteroid hits the earth
        - Putin launches nukes
    - Jokes aside: outside of dramatic events like described above, most of the risks are in our own hands. Regulation is not a huge concern for us as our token cannot be seen as a security.
