# General

## Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?

**Chattanooga, Tennessee**  
**Bay area/LA, California**

## What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do?

Referrals are an ideal way to find good job matches because of the high levels of context and trust they provide. Referrers understand what the job candidate and employer require beyond just keywords, especially if the referrer is an expert in the field. The referrers own reputation at stake makes both parties trust the referral more. The higher the context & trust, the better the chances of a successful job match. This type of talent matching has limitations because it depends on who you know and is not scalable.

We are developing a PageRank-style talent search protocol that uses AI and blockchain to scale context and trust. Our protocol surfaces the most relevant talent for your needs with enough context and trust that you could skip the first interview. This protocol can be used in any setting, such as your own discord, slack, or teams, and could become the talent coordination layer for the web.

Referrals are the best way to find good job matches because they involve high levels of context and trust. Context on one hand: The person making the referral understands what the job candidate and the employer are looking for beyond just keywords, especially if the referrer is an expert in the field, like a machine learning engineer referring another machine learning engineer. Trust on the other hand: Both parties trust the referral more because the referrer has their reputation at stake in the success of the referral. The more context and trust there is, the better the chances of a successful job match. The only problem is, this kind of talent matching is limited by who you know and therefore not scalable.

Until AI & blockchain achieved their current level of maturity, referral-level talent matching would’ve remained very hard to scale. However, both technologies are respectively great context & trust scalars. It is from this insight that we’re building a PageRank-for-people style talent search protocol that uses LLMs (AI) & L2 blockchains to scale context & trust through various ways such as capturing a lot more context about candidates & employers through a 30-minute interview that we transcribe and “feed” to our LLM for context matching as well as using blockchain-enabled skin-in-the-game-mechanism design to make endorsements & reviews a lot more meaningful in order to achieve referral-level talent matching at scale.

Eden uses AI and blockchain to make finding the right people easier. We use a special way of ranking people called PageRank, like how Google ranks websites. Before, it was hard to find the best people because it was all based on who you knew. But with our new protocol, you can easily find the best people for your needs, even without an interview. You can use our protocol in any situation, like on Discord, Slack, or Teams. Our goal is for our protocol to be the best way to find talent on the internet.

Eden uses AI and blockchain to scale context and trust in talent matching with a PageRank-for-people style protocol. It's like a PageRank for people, and it helps you find the most relevant talent with enough context and trust to skip the first interview. This protocol can be used anywhere, including your own communication platforms or the entire web.

Referrals are the best way to find good job matches because they involve high levels of context and trust. The person making the referral understands what the job candidate and the employer are looking for beyond just keywords, especially if the referrer is an expert in the field, like a machine learning engineer referring another machine learning engineer. Both parties trust the referral more because the referrer has a personal stake in the success of the referral. The more context and trust there is, the better the chances of a successful job match.

Before AI & blockchain got to where they are, it was impossible to scale either context or trust to the level that is needed to get to the referral-level talent matching at scale. Eden uses both LLMs & L2 blockchain-enabled mechanism design to scale context & trust in a PageRank-for-people style algorithm to help you surface the most relevant talent for your needs.

Before AI & blockchain got to where they are, it was impossible to scale either context or trust to the level that is needed to get to the referral-level talent matching at scale. Eden uses both AI techniques such as LLMs and GCNNs as well as L2-blockchain-enabled mechanism design to scale context & trust in a PageRank-for-people style protocol. This protocol is what we’re developing to help you surface the most relevant talent for your needs in any type of environment: from within your own discord to across the entire web.

Google for talent search. What PageRank did for information relevance, our protocol does for talent relevance. Whether you're looking for your next teammate or a project to work on, Eden is your go-to platform for fast and reliable results.

Our talent search protocol maps entire communities, easily integrating with popular online communication and collaboration tools such as Discord, Slack, or Teams. It creates an index of each person's skills and collaborations in a knowledge graph. Using AI techniques, we calculate a credibility score per person and skill through a combination of backlinks. These backlinks come from i.a. peer-to-peer on-chain reputation staking mechanisms, as well as different forms of attestations such as verifiable credentials, collaboration reviews,... The credibility score forms the foundation of our "PageRank-for-people" algorithm, which surfaces the most relevant individual for your talent query with confidence.

You can efficiently search the network by interacting with our LLM, which acts as a personal career coach on the talent side and a specialized recruiter on the hiring side. Our AI's community-powered notion of talent credibility, thanks to our PageRank-for-people protocol, provides the key to making the search useful. Eden's interoperable nature allows for numerous use cases, such as suggesting the best internal or external person for a task on a Trello card or powering the talent matching engine for talent marketplaces. It's evident that Eden can make a significant difference in various scenarios.

The credibility scores in combination with LLM-powered context mapping surfaces the most credible person for your talent query.

  

There’s a huge information asymmetry in what a candidate knows about themselves & what a searcher knows about the opportunity. That’s why you search the network by interacting with our LLM. It acts as a personal career coach on the talent side & a specialised recruiter on the hiring side - think of it as the AI-native upgrade to LinkedIn recruiter & LinkedIn learning. With the added benefit that our AI has a community-powered notion of talent credibility thanks to our PageRank-for-people protocol.

We’re also building Eden to be integration by default. By building Eden in this interoperable way, there are many use-cases that Eden could make the difference in - from suggesting on a trello card who the best internal or external person for the task might be - to powering the talent matching engine for talent marketplaces. This functionality is a distribution channel in and of itself and will help reinforce our network.

## Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

Most of it done by Miltiadis - we both have a CS background so a lot of the conceptual thinking is done together.

## How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

We met a year ago in the incubation program of Entrepreneur First [www.joinef.com](http://www.joinef.com/), a global VC with a 10b dollar portfolio and a talent investing thesis that brings together high-potential individuals to co-found companies.

From our very first call, four weeks before the official start of the EF program, we hit it off. Our thinking was highly complementary - Tom was more conceptual, while Miltos very quickly made those concepts concrete.

Entrepreneur First pushes you to be very intentional about your co-founder relationship. They help you stress-test the relationship from multiple different angles. One of EF's sayings is “productivity is traction for teams”. We were churning out and disproving hypotheses at lightning speed.

Usually, EF tries to actively break up teams they don’t believe in. However, we've been a team since day one of the program and they have never even tried to break us up. In our second week of working together, we decided last-minute to attend ETH Amsterdam. On the way back, we decided to push our co-founder relationship to the max to see if we’d be able to work together for the next 5 - 10 years, so we moved into the same apartment. We haven’t looked back since.

We spend 24/7 together building Eden Protocol and we love it. We found a solid foundation in our mutual deep commitment to doing whatever it takes to make Eden happen, our shared deep commitment to growth and impact, as well as the ability we share to have highly difficult and emotional conversations in a very productive way.

  

We met a year ago during the Entrepreneur First incubation program [www.joinef.com](http://www.joinef.com/), which is a global VC that invests in high-potential individuals to co-found companies.

There was immediate synergy the moment we met. Our thinking is highly complementary - Tom was more conceptual, while Miltos very quickly made those ideas concrete. Entrepreneur First helped us to further stress-test our relationship from multiple angles. They encourage productivity as a measure of team traction, and we were able to churn out and disprove hypotheses at lightning speed.

In our second week of working together we decided to push our co-founder relationship to the max by moving into the same apartment. We found a solid foundation in our commitment to making Eden happen, our shared commitment to growth and impact, and our ability to have difficult conversations in a productive way.

We've now lived together in multiple countries, and as one of our investors says, we've burned the ships and are in this for the long haul.

# Progress

## How far along are you?

We onboarded 300 developers using our alpha tools, which are live in Developer DAO, a community of over 5,000 active developers and 26,000 lurking developers. Our goal for the next couple of weeks is to build something that can replace Pallet for community recruiters. We’re falsifying 5 hypotheses a week around this goal as our team and process prioritizes speed of learning above anything.

We have a waitlist of 10 communities, protocols & hackathons that want to use Eden to make their communities searchable for talent with 0 outbound outreach and a very stealthy website. Our internal mantra is currently very much hack value before you hack growth and we want to become undeniable in D_D first.

In terms of building: Miltos & I have moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee to “burn the ships” & go heads down building, away from all distractions in a founder residency: [https://www.justlaybrick.com](https://www.justlaybrick.com). Over the last 6 months, we have received over 170 applications from contributors who want to volunteer to build Eden with us. We’ve selected 15-20 from those 170 who are spending between 10-15 hours a week with us. We also closed a $500k pre-seed round, which has allowed us to hire a full-time core team of 4 people in addition to the volunteering contributors.

## How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

About 8 months full time - we moved in together to work on this so we’re literally working on this 24/7.

## Are people using your product?

Yes, despite being very rudimentary, ugly & wonky alpha tools. We have about 300 people onboarded. The alternative to what we’re building in most of these communities are outdated notion tables or very vague discord profiles. We’re currently very much a “brick” for a “hair on fire problem”.

## Do you have revenue?

We’ve received around $300K worth of grants from different DAOs (Developer DAO, OCEAN DAO, we did a Gitcoin round with 273 backers) & online communities to build what we’re building today. We’re a couple of months away from having recurring revenue from helping recruiters source from communities.

## If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

We did Entrepreneur First. Also currently one of our investors is brickyard (https://www.justlaybrick.com), which hosts a founder residency - they and all the YC founders there are a big reason of why we’re applying as they said how great YC actually was.

# Idea

## Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

Both of us had seen clear challenges with talent matching from up close. This is Tom’s 4th talent & technology-related startup - with an exit in 2022. Miltos was part of the Goldman Sachs team using GCNNs (AI) to do internal talent matching.

The reason we came together in the first place was that we both have the ambition to impact a billion people’s lives positively. Our belief is that the best way to do that is to solve a huge problem by enabling a paradigm shift. We came across this statistic that 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work - a pretty big problem. We took this as a clear signal that we need a new model for work and that now was the time for it driven by 3 important forces: regulatory (crypto regulation, remote hiring regulation,...), technological (AI & Blockchain maturing) & socio-economic (the labor market continuing to liquefy, poly-work on the rise, the great resignation, quiet quitting …) change.

We envisioned a future where a liquid workforce could be empowered to do meaningful work anywhere, at any time. From there, we got to work to let the market “pull the product out of us”. This led us to DAOs initially, as they held a promise of work agency by default, purpose-aligned communities & a digital infrastructure that works for you instead of the other way around - which all sounded great in light of our vision.

We hacked together a talent coordination bot in discord for a DAO in two weeks & ended up receiving $300K in grants (of which $100K in tokens) and the rest in hours contributed from over 60 different volunteer builders (out of a total of 170 applications) aggregated from multiple DAOs & communities. We took this as green lights to keep building - and very quickly realized that what we’re building could be way bigger than just DAOs in light of the previously mentioned inflection points & vision.

**Why we picked it:**

This is Tom’s fourth technology & talent related startup - with an exit in 2022. Miltos was using AI for internal talent matching at Goldman Sachs. We both share the ambition to positively impact the lives of one billion people. To do that, we know we have to solve a massive problem in a paradigm-shifting space, which is experiencing at least 3 complementary inflection points on a regulatory, technology, and socio-economic level. The problem they seek to solve is the fact that 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work. They believe that a new model for work is necessary and envision a future where anyone, anywhere can do meaningful work. They are working to let the market "pull the product out of them".

  

Until AI & blockchain achieved their current level of maturity, referral-level talent matching would’ve remained very hard to scale beyond “who you know”. However, both technologies are respectively great context & trust scalers. It is from this insight that we’re building a PageRank-for-people style talent search protocol that uses LLMs & GCNNs (AI) & L2 blockchains to scale context & trust in various ways. One such way is by capturing a lot more context about candidates & employers through a 30-minute interview that we transcribe and “feed” to our LLM for context matching. Another is to make endorsements & reviews a lot more meaningful by requiring authors to stake their reputation on them through a blockchain-enabled mechanism. There are many more that we’re exploring, all with the objective to scale context & trust to achieve referral-level talent matching at scale.

  

We approached the kind of company we want to build from our shared ambition to impact a billion+ people’s lives positively. Our thesis around being able to do that is that we should solve a huge problem in a space that is experiencing 3 meaningful inflection points: regulatory, technological & socio-economic and Ideally this should be a space in which we have an “edge”.

The future of work + web3 is that space for us. The main problem we saw is that 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work, which we took as a sign that we need a new model for work. Getting more people on the right project for the right reasons seemed like an important starting point. We envisioned a future where anyone, anywhere is empowered to do meaningful work. From there, we got to work to let the market “pull the product out of us”.

**Our “edge” or domain expertise:**

- This is Tom’s 4th talent + technology related startups with a specific focus on leveraging AI & Blockchain techniques - with an exit in 2022.
- Miltos is an AI-phd dropout & was part of the Goldman Sachs team using GCNNs (AI) to do internal talent matching.

**How do we know people need what we’re making:**

- On the macro scale:
    - As the labour market liquifies, we need more context-aware, credible & faster talent matches.
        - The 40 year career is long-gone and the labour market is going to liquify more, not less - as >50% of the US workforce is projected to be freelance by 2027. We are lacking the adequate tools on either side of the labour market to service that trend effectively.
        - With remote on the rise, having just one employer makes less-and-less sense, poly-work is on the rise, however we are also lacking adequate tooling to service this.
- On the micro scale:
    - We are tapping into existing behaviours that are riddled with pain & inefficiency
        - People join online communities for 4 types of reasons:
            - Learn, earn, connect or collaborate
                - Today, finding somebody with talent that could help you with either of those 4 is very hard. Your best bet are a “jobs & gigs” channel in discord or if you’re lucky an outdated notion table.
            - We did a survey in Developer DAO, a community of 5000 active devs and only 1/10 people that wanted to contribute, got to contribute.
            - We’ve received over 300K in grants from communities to build this & over 170 applications of people wanting to volunteer their time to build this with us.
        - Recruiters go through quite a lot of “pain” establishing themselves in these communities - but many get rejected by the community.
            - They see the huge value in having access to these communities - not only for the talent, but also for the networks of all the talent within that network.
            - Every single “community recruiter” that we see unanimously tells us they want access to our (crappy) alpha tools yesterday.

## Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?

Incumbents like LinkedIn, Indeed & UpWork are not even close when it comes to referral level-talent matching. In a world where all the profiles, proposals & cover letters are written by chatGPT, you’re going to need other signals than self-written and self-attested information. Review & trust-building mechanisms on these websites operate on skewed incentives of rage or reciprocity - rendering reviews & endorsements pretty meaningless. Context matching happens with keywords - which is the lowest bandwidth context matching possible. The main strategy on either of these platforms is therefore volume - as in apply to everything and “see what sticks”.

When it comes to referral-level talent matching for the incumbents like LinkedIn, Indeed & UpWork are miles out. The main strategy on either of these platforms is volume - as in apply to everything and “see what sticks”. Review & trust-building mechanisms operate on skewed incentives of rage or reciprocity. Context matching happens with keywords. On top of that, these guys all face the innovator's dilemma and it’s not looking like they’ll go much further than integrating a ChatGPT plugin in the near future - which will make their current data more easily searchable, but won’t fix the underlying talent relevance & credibility/trust problem. (basically what are all the endorsements on LinkedIn or 5* ratings on Upwork really worth in the context of talent relevance?)

**Competitors:**

- Incumbents like **LinkedIn & UpWork**
    - Neither LinkedIn nor UpWork do a really good job when it comes to talent-credibility & relevance when looking to hire someone.
    - On UpWork there’s a 5* rating that says very little in regards to the ability of a freelancer being able to do a particular job for you. The dominant strategy for most freelancers is also to apply to everything, everywhere all the time.
    - LinkedIn went “quantity over quality” route which leads to job applications being flooded with irrelevant candidates and a lot of extra work for whoever’s sourcing. All the information is self-reported with very little checks on them.
    - Neither leverage the power of community very well - on LinkedIn it’s mostly around broadcasting who you are rather than developing meaningful working relationships.
    - Eden goes the quality over quantity route by introducing our on-chain staking & attestation mechanisms, without losing the thing that makes LinkedIn & UpWork work - which is that “everyone’s there”. This is the reason we’re starting in communities where people are already looking for each-other. Our PageRank for people algorithm goes way further to truly understand your talent by leveraging community, blockchain & AI.
    - When you’re not sure who you’re looking for on these platforms - it’s very hard to find what you need. The Eden LLM guides you in thinking through your talent needs in the same way a recruiter would.
- Community job-boards like **Pallet**
    - Pallet enables hosting of a job board exclusively for a community. Companies pay to advertise positions within communities and gain access to local talent.
        - Both Pallet & Eden use the value of community in sourcing talent but Pallet severely underutilizes it. Eden goes further by providing tooling that allows members to co-create & corroborate each other profiles - i.a. attesting for each other’s work, stake reputation on one another and letting the tool to be used for internal talent mobility - not just (external) jobs listings. This allows Eden to provide a lot more credibility & context and therefore relevance per profile.
        - Pallet says they provide access to "passive" candidates, but in reality, this only includes people who stumble upon the Pallet board and briefly glance at the opportunity. Eden gives you an active way, think updraded LinkedIn search for the community, to find relevant talent to speak to.
        - Pallet focuses on full-time roles. Eden can help find the right person for a five-hour, one-off project or a full-time role and everything in between - which given where the labour market is headed & most of the talent in such communities looking for freelance work is key.
- Decentralised sourcing/referral networks like **Jobprotocol, tech-tree or intropia**
    - These projects essentially provide a permissionless way to claim a bounty when you help fill a role by bringing your own network.
        - A big problem with this however is that you the “dominant strategy” here is for recruiters & people with networks to just “see what sticks” - finding a candidate that is just good enough to get the bounty - which says very little about relevance & credibility - and potentially doesn’t help the candidate & hirer at all and gives them a see of work sifting through all the (shit) applications. Eden’s aim is to provide so much credibility & relevance to let you skip the first interview, while these other projects aim to solve the match by incentivising volume of interviews.
        - We believe these projects take a skeuomorphic approach to referrals. They build the Yahoo of talent search, while we’re building the Google. We have a similar core insight: referrals offer the best matches for talent. However, these projects only add an incentive layer on top of open roles. Eden takes it a step further by asking: what makes a referral great? The answer is context and trust. Context means knowing the person, their work, career goals, and how it relates to the open position. Trust comes from the referrer staking their social capital within the referral. AI and Blockchain can scale both aspects, eliminating the need for a third-party referrer and the hassle of sifting through bad applications.

**Unique Understanding:**

To summarise our unique insights:

- Talent matching cannot be solved purely through algorithms; a socio-economic layer is necessary. This can be achieved by capturing existing behaviours through blockchain-enabled mechanism design in communities. Our competitors over-index on the socio-economic aspect, leaving a lot of algorithmic power on the table. Our PageRank for people puts algorithmic robustness front and center, with socio-economic elements weaved in where they matter most. This places us in a far better position to leverage AI than our competitors.
    - For example: Say either Jobprotocol, pallet or even LinkedIn decide to leverage LLMs to make their talent base searchable. The kind of information they’re going off would be nothing but mostly self-reported text. By having our skin-in-the-game staking mechanisms to calculate our credibility score per skill we have a lot more signal around the things that really matter which is credibility.
- Introducing a third party with an incentive that is not in line with both main parties skews the "game" whenever you tie a referrer directly to the referral transaction. Eden has a "better" approach by rewarding people who recognize talent. This approach rewards them for their ability to recognize talent, rather than for getting someone hired.
- The one thing that matters in talent search is providing access to the right people, not just the available ones. LinkedIn is the biggest because everyone’s there - people are willing to put up with the pain of having 600 (shitty) applications for one job offer since they know.
- Identify one or two key things that you understand about your business that your competitors don't.
- Explain how these insights give you a competitive advantage.
- Provide evidence to support your claims, such as customer feedback or market research.

# How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

There are two levels at which we intend to make money:

1. The Protocol Level
    
    1. As the core of what we’re building is the “pageRank for people” protocol, we simply intend to take a percentage for every transaction our protocol enables. Money gets put into an escrow, the work is done - money is released - 10% goes to Eden.
    2. Top down: When we pull our vision of becoming the world’s talent coordination layer, we could replace the 720 billion staffing & recruitment industry. Even 1% of that industry would already mean we’re a pretty big company.
    3. Bottom up: An obvious first “big” market to serve with our talent matching protocol is the growing freelance & poly-work labour markets. The average salary for a freelancer in the US is $21/hour, that puts the Average Transaction value/month for a full time freelancer at $3360. The United States has the fastest growing freelance market globally, with a 78% growth in yearly earnings. Currently, statistics show that there are 59 million freelancers, and the number is expected to hit 86.5 million by 2027  
          
        We have a plan to service 10% of that market by 2027 - putting our total user-base at 8 million. Assume the distribution of the type of transactions that happen through Eden are as follows: 10% get full time paid employment,  
        40% do 10h/week paid employment, 50% do 10h/month paid employment. Respectively that gives: (3,200,000 users * $1260 ATV/month * 10% takerate) = $403,200,000 MRR + (4,000,000 users * $210 ATV/month * 10% takerate) = $84,000,000 MRR + (800,000 * $3360 ATV/month * 10% takerate = $268,800,000 MRR for a total of $756,000,000  
        
    4. An open marketplace for freelancers & polyworkers: An obvious big market to serve with our talent matching protocol is the growing freelance & poly-work labor markets - we can build this ontop of the communities that we onboard. We could offer additional services through partners such as insurance, removing all the legal & operational friction for freelancers,.... Provide reputation-building paths for beginning freelancers, …
    
    Our objective by year-end is to enable 50,000 successful labor-exchanges through Eden. The average salary for a US freelancer is $21/hour, resulting in an average monthly transaction value of $3,360 for a full-time freelancer. We expect the following distribution of transactions through Eden, based on community types and customer conversations: 10% full-time employment, 40% 10 hours/week, and 50% 10 hours/month. This translates, with a 10% take-rate, to $1.68 million MRR from 5,000 users, $2.52 million MRR from 20,000 users, and $525,000 MRR from 25,000 users, for a total of $4.725 million MRR. We aim for a month-over-month growth rate of 10%-15% until we dominate a significant portion of the labor market.
    
    #### Protocol Business Model (1)
    
    |User Group|Number of Users|Takerate|Monthly ATV|Total MRR|
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    |[[My writings/All writings/Application YC/Protocol Business Model (1)/10h-week\|10h-week]]|3,200,000|10%|$1,260.00|403200000|
    |[[My writings/All writings/Application YC/Protocol Business Model (1)/10h-month\|10h-month]]|4,000,000|10%|$210.00|84000000|
    |[[My writings/All writings/Application YC/Protocol Business Model (1)/Fulltimers\|Fulltimers]]|800,000|10%|$3,360.00|268800000|
    
      
      
    
2. The App Level
    1. Communities
        1. Premium features: for community recruiters built on top of our talent match.
        2. 39% of Linkedin users pay for Linkedin premium at a cost of $180/month for LinkedIn recruiter (the highest paying tier). Say 20% of our user-base pays for premium tool at an average price of $100/month, 1,600,000 * $100/month = $160,000,000 MRR
    2. Corporates
        1. B2B SaaS licenses: Internal talent mobility tool with ability to click in a “liquid workforce”.
        2. Human Capital Management Software is a $15billion market & growing. Combine it with the trend that more and more companies are hiring freelancers and Eden as the perfect tool to click in & manage a liquid workforce and there’s an opportunity to make money on both the placing of the people as the managing of the workforce through the same protocol.
