13. _(optional)_ How did all founders meet?

We met in the incubation program of Entrepreneur First (www.joinef.com), a global VC with a 10b dollar portfolio and a talent investing thesis that brings together high-potential individuals to co-found companies with notable web3 companies Aztec, Vaults & Gensyn having their roots there.

We hit it off on our very first call, 4 weeks before the official start of the EF program. Our thinking is highly complementary - Tom is more conceptual, Miltos very quickly makes those concepts concrete. Entrepreneur First actively stress tests the relationship - and a year and a half later we’re still going. Since then we’ve lived together in 3 different countries together and currently we live together in Chattanooga, Tennessee in a pre-seed/seed founder residency called brickyard (www.justlaybrick.com).

What binds us more than anything is a deeply shared commitment to growth & contribution + our ability we share to have highly difficult & emotional conversations in a very productive way.

_(optional)_ Have any of the founders worked together before? What did you build?

  

Upload a one minute video introducing yourself/yourselves. Tell us who you are, and why you're building this. No script, just you.

We are unable to notify applicants if their link is not working due to the volume of applications we receive._

**3.   Progress**

1. Describe the progress you've made on your project or company so far.

The beta version of the job-board that our our AI runs for online communities, has been live for a month and a half in Developer DAO. Since launch, we had over 4000 job-board hits & our first 300 community members do AI-interviews with an average session being 11 minute up to 37 min. This shows how engaging the interview is + the depth of info we’re able to capture: we capture over 100 relevant data points per interview. We generated our first 1000$ in revenue for the DAO. In the next 6 months, we’re racing to grow our AI-interviewed talent network to 5.000 so we can launch a subscription product, think LinkedIn recruiter for web3 built on top of web3-communities & built to skip recruiters to cater directly to hiring managers by being a lot more precise in its ability to target & match relevant people & jobs.

We’re also making good progress to launch a network-native business model with our multi-player, key-powered vouching mechanism. In essence, whoever holds a key of a talent that ends up getting hired through Eden gets a piece of their hiring bounty. When communities hold the keys of all their community members in a multi-sig, that multi-sig gets paid each time anyone from the community gets hired. This incentivises community-leadership/influencers to advertise relevant opportunities from the Eden network to their own talent base/community + make becoming part of the Eden network part of their community onboarding flow. That way we can build the most effective hiring network the internet has ever seen, together.

  

1. How long have you (founder/s) been working on this?

The current product iteration - 3 months, we’ve been building together since march 2022.

**4.   Tokens**

1. Do you plan on launching a token?
    
    TL;DR - we’re experimenting & learning with a token in mind.  
      
    Our hypothesis is that a token enables necessary skin-in-the-game mechanisms for effective reputation staking/vouching, talent prediction markets & generally designing powerful incentive flows to activate the network to get the right person on the right project for the right reasons. However, we want to launch pragmatically backed by lessons learned as nimbly as possible which is why we’re prioritising running experiments with keys & points rather than launching a token straight away.  
    
      
    
2. **Describe why what you’re building benefits from being onchain?**

  

TL;DR - without blockchains, info is harder to verify & trust - our AI needs high-signal, trustable info to make trustworthy, effective matches.

  

1. AI’s are horrible at “judging” people, (prediction) markets are better.
    1. We’ve all heard the horror stories of biased AI’s. If you consider what AI’s are: basically advanced statistical models, you understand the bias is the feature & not the bug. So just like using a toothbrush to clean your toilet is a sub-optimal tool to get the task done, so too is using AI to judge the credibility & ability of talent.
    2. What has historically been pretty good at “judging” talent & determining the value of skills & abilities is the market in combination with the local-prediction market that is the team making the hiring decision. Blockchains make it possible to design skin-in-the-game mechanisms that embed these market dynamics in the network & can create a way better notion of talent-value than AI ever could at network scale (rather than remain local).
2. On chain = opportunity to design better hiring game / Show me the incentives & I’ll show you the outcome
    1. The current dominant strategy in the hiring game is volume (or spam in internet terms). (Bad) recruiters are not incentivised to find the best match rather to find the match that will stay in the role long enough for them to get paid - which means that it’s often a better strategy to throw as much at the wall and see what sticks rather than really do the work to figure out if the match is there. Look at LinkedIn & the amount of messages you get & despite the limitations that LinkedIn puts up it still pays to send out as many messages as possible - that’s because the game theoretical dominant strategy is spam, that’s a fundamental network design flaw.
    2. Blockchains offer the opportunity to design networks in which the dominant strategy is not spam. Our vouching mechanism for example is designed to make the dominant strategy producing & verifying relevant information that leads to a hire for each-other. Producing that kind of information in a verifiable way backed by skin-in-the-game mechanisms is only possible thanks to blockchains.
3. Blockchains allow for a higher signal/noise ratio by making information more cheaply verifiable
    1. The dominant strategy of spam with now AI writing & optimising resume & cover letters make the current application landscape very noisy & signal poor: companies try to get as many applicants as possible & then filter on relatively poor proxies of whether talent would be a good fit such as key-words etc, which means that talent applies to as much jobs as possible, which still makes it very expensive to reduce the information asymmetry between talent & hiring manager effectively (i.e. 7 round interviews etc)
    2. Instead of paying different recruiters ungodly amounts to verify the same information about talent, you could more efficiently use resources by recording the information and its verifications (like vouches, reference checks and collaboration reviews) & reward the people that have recorded them for doing so - which would still be a fraction for infinitely better information. You can also design mechanisms that price in the dynamic, inflationary nature of credibility and the value of skills in the market through mechanisms such as talent prediction markets. These are mechanisms that were not pragmatically implementable without blockchains.

  

1. It’s the only way to make hiring effectively multi-player
    1. Referrals are the best talent matches but they’re almost impossible to scale well. There have been a couple of web3 startups that tried to scale referrals by incentivising them through permissionless bounties - but ended up achieving the opposite of what they set out to achieve: spammy applications become the dominant strategy on their platform (of course I’ll send in a resume for the chance of getting a 20K recruiter bounty) - and they had an attribution problem: “you said you referred this person while we say we were already talking to this person.”
    2. Hiring is at its core a network issue. The problem is that you’re achieving local optima by incentivising single players (recruiters who our out for a bounty) to play the network. It leads to opportunity & candidate hoarding. It’s not hard to see that if you’re trying to get the right person on the right project for the right reasons at network scale, hoarding isn’t helpful.
    3. So if you design a network where you don’t reward the referral itself - but the actions/information sharing that lead to a good match, such as talent verification, signal borrowing through vouching, etc. then you’re making the hiring game truly multi-player while disincentivising local maxima & talent hoarding. + By making it indisputable that you bought key x of talent y at time z and they got hired at time t you have produced information that led to a hire for which you get reward r you get rid of the attribution problem. That’s only possible on chain.
2. **What chain(s) are you building on? How did you choose?**
    
    Short answer - we’re not building on any yet. Longer answer: We’re considering base, polygon, sui & optimism with a slight preference for base knowing that coinbase is behind it & our product would initially be targeted at the US market. This is something we would love your advice on.
    
3. What’s your business model?
    
    Take-rate on each valuable transaction enabled:
    
    1. Company paying community for targeted distribution: we take a cut of every job-post sold
    2. Company releasing hiring bounty for a successful hire: a % of every hiring bounty that is released
    3. Talent borrowing signal from a mentor: a % of every key bought
    
    Subscription for additional pro-features for power users in the network:
    
    1. Cross-community AI-powered search - think LinkedIn recruiter for web3
