Finding work you love can be a full-time job. What if you had a tireless talent agent that went out to find, vet & apply to opportunities for you? I'm going to show you how joining Eden's Magic Talent Oasis will help you find your dream opportunity, faster in 3 simple steps.

First I'll show you how Eden helps you find & pick the right opportunities for you. Eden's always-on precision search & notifications saves you 100s of hours in searching & applying to opportunities that don’t align with your talents, goals & aspirations. Second I'll dive into how Eden helps you set yourself up for success with actionable pre- & post- interview feedback - making sure you hit all the right notes. Third I'll show you how Eden stays on top of all of your applications for you and how, as you do more and more interviews through Eden, you won't have to do any of your own introductory interviews anymore. If Michael Jordan didn't have to do introductory interviews, why should you?

Step 1: How to get Eden to find the perfect opportunities for you.

To join Eden's magic talent oasis, go to your community's magic job board and click "sign up". Upload your CV, and Eden will read it and conduct your intake interview for the oasis. This interview is not a job interview, but a talent agent intake interview. Eden will ask detailed questions to gather all the information she needs to help you find opportunities that align with your talents, goals, and aspirations. The more you interact with Eden, the better she will be able to represent you. Unlike other recruiters who can connect you with only 10s of opportunities for each recruiter you interview with, Eden can match you with endless opportunities. You could say Eden conducts the one interview to rule them all…

Step 2: Let Eden help you set yourself up for success.

Now that you're in the oasis, you will start receiving curated opportunities. Because Eden has a ton more context, these recommendations actually make sense and always have a clear motivation attached to them, so you can still decide if you agree or disagree with that assessment. The point of Eden is to surface the opportunities for you that are the true needle-movers for your career while helping you spotlight your relevant talents.

Step 3: Stay on top of all of it.

At any point can you ask about the status of any of your applications through Telegram and get an immediate answer. If you wake up in the middle of the night realizing you forgot to add to your interview, add that information at any point. Ask all the questions you might still have about the status of your application or even a question you might have about the company that you're applying with and if Eden doesn’t have the answer, you can ask her to find out on your behalf.

To recap: this is how Eden helps you find your dream opportunity faster

Never again do you need to spend hours scrolling on job-boards, think for hours about what you should say on your application only to jump on an interview where you answer the same questions you have in all the other interviews. Instead, let Eden be your talent agent.
