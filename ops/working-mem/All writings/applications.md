Built, scaled, and sold the top AI x Talent innovation agencies in Belgium by age 25, with top-clients such as EU institutions, big multinationals, and BEL20 companies - which was my 3rd (relatively successful) business at that time. Travelled the world for 2 years before starting college, completely self funded (arrived in Australia with a backpack and $200 in my pocket) while traveling (made me pretty resourceful ;) )Successfully raised a pre-seed for a crypto startup right when FTX collapsed - really sharpened my raising skills üôÉI'm in the US on the same visa as Messi - the football (Soccer?) player ;)

‚Ä¢ Word of Mouth  
‚Ä¢ From a SPC Member  
**Who is the SPC member?***  
**What is their email address(es)?**  
Only put the member's email address in this field. If you are sharing multiple emails, separate each with a comma.  
**What are you building and why**  
  
**What product ideas or market opportunities are you interested in exploring?***  
If multiple, please make a list. Keep under 1000 characters.I've spent the past 10 years on helping people do work they love with people they like. 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work - how epic would the world be if that was 0%? That's $8.8 trillion in lost productivity according to a 2023 gallup study - not to mention the opportunity cost of the next Einstein becoming a lawyer because there was no true job-mobility for him. AI is an opportunity to reshape our relationship to and all of our systems around "work". I want to build a company that leads the charge in reshaping that relationship: from something most of us "have" to do to something we "get" to do.  
**What expertise do you have related to the ideas you are exploring?***  
Keep under 1000 charactersIn the last 10 years I've built: (2016 - 2017) TMWRK: a geo-location based skill finding app: see what the skills of the people around you are and team up with them. (2017 - 2019 [small exit]) Perspektiv.ai: a talent-matching engine for internships. (2019 - 2021 [small exit]) Humain.ai: an innovation agency helping global orgs leverage AI to get the right person on the right project for the right reasons working on things like predicting employee churn & anticipating an org's future skill needs based on market-data (i.e. how likely are we going to need 20% more data engineers in the next 6 months given market trends of X)  
**What progress have you made?***Pre-Launch  
**What does or will your company do?***  
Give us your elevator pitch. Keep under 250 characters. Find talent you love through people you like. Let AI search the network of your close network so you can ask for specific, high-signal intro's to top-tier talent in your sphere of influence & reward the intro's that lead to a hire.  
**Share what you are planning to launch**  
URL, loom video, deck, or memo. Please make sure it has the correct sharing permissions.  
**How long has the team actively been exploring or building?***  
(Answer format: Write # + months or # + years) Keep under 100 characters.  
**Link to something you have created. If you have cofounders, preferably as a team.***  
It could be a memo, master plan, or a prototype (does not have to be related to your current areas of exploration). Please make sure it has the correct sharing permissions.Here's the vouching flow in Eden, which a job-seeker can use to boost their discoverability in the Eden network - they would send this link to people that would vouch for them (ex colleagues, friends, ...):

**In your area(s) of exploration, what's a non-consensus or contrarian view that you hold?***  
Keep under 1000 characters. The perfect match is a myth: Humans are irrational & unpredictable and perfection requires rationality & predictability (if all it took was data linkedin would've buit the AI that gives you the 5 ideal candidates already). Almost everyone building an AI-recruiter disagrees with me on this - because to build a successful AI-recruiter you need to believe that the hiring process is a purely information gathering process rather than a sometimes quirky connection process of two human beings trying to figure out if they want to work together. AI comes with a huge loss in important (human) hiring signals: where a cover letter used to be a signal of your ability to think & write, an adapted resume a signal of thoughtfulness and effort - now it simply shows you can use AI. The other way is true as well - a hiring manager writing a personal follow up message trying to convince you to join was a signal of care & respect, now it shows you bought the software with the right automation.  
**(Optional) If you are applying with the same ideas from a previous application, did anything change? If you applied with different ideas or areas of exploration, what have you learned?**  
**(Optional) If none of your current ideas or explorations work out, are there others you would consider?**  
Feel free to share the craziest thing you've thought about building or exploring. Keep under 1000 characters.  
**Have you raised any funding already for this company and/or have you actively fundraised in the last 6 months?***  
**(Optional) If you know a builder/founder who you think should join the cohort, enter their email below.**  
Cohort talent density is one of the most important benefits of the fellowship. We will email this person letting them know you think they might be a good fit.
