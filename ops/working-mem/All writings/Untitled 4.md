Hi {{first_name}},

TL;DR - I built an AI-agent + app that makes referrals scalable & I'm using it to accelerate my search for the right co-founder - you can help by using it [here](https://app.joineden.ai/intro-request?opportunity=cce37645-436a-46fb-bea0-f5b267576f88) : [https://app.joineden.ai/intro-request?opportunity=cce37645-436a-46fb-bea0-f5b267576f88](https://app.joineden.ai/intro-request?opportunity=cce37645-436a-46fb-bea0-f5b267576f88)

The vision: Cursor is turning industry experts into better devs than yesterday's software developers because they have insights that devs don't have + now also the ability to execute. I want to do the same for your network: turn the people you admire or have a great connection with into the best recruiters by automating away any of the search, vet & match work done by recruiters & letting your friends/(ex-)colleagues/mentors/investors/alumni leverage the unfair advantage they have over today's recruiters & tomorrow's AI's: social context & influence.

ASK: Please connect your network through the link I gave you + if you want to launch your own opportunity to hire through the people you like, you can go here: [https://app.joineden.ai/hire](https://app.joineden.ai/hire) - will start charging next week, so get your free opportunities in while you can ;)

Here's a [demo](https://www.loom.com/share/6d6ef73b973948e4b2b61af0de35349a?sid=f3488eb3-e81c-48e6-873d-a89c6444c744) video on how it works, updated demo & website coming soon.

It seems like my 2024Q4 update didn't come through for some, if that's you and you'd like to read it - just ping me and I'll re-send it.

In this update I'll assume you've read it.

As talked about in the last update - it's become clear that online-communities are not the place to find & hire exceptional talent. Building an AI-interviewer/recruiter is a great way to chase top talent away: They already don't want to talk to a recruiter, and even less to an AI-recruiter. So, in going back the drawing board, I spent a lot of time thinking where & how we CAN get the top-talent in the age of AI - and that's still referrals. They won't talk to an AI-recruiter, but a message from your ex-colleague that they've been in the trenches with for 5 years, that they reply to. The thing that makes referrals so useful/powerful is that hard-earned social context & influence that neither a recruiter nor an AI can build up quickly. Not wanting to use that lightly is where all the signal is.

The pressure is mounting: Hiring & finding a job is a painful processes for most people. In a noisy AI-world where classic hiring signals (resume, cover letter, interview (check out parkeet-ai.com, literally does the interview for you) are losing all of their merit, it is becoming even more painful. Candidates seeming great because they know how to use AI are getting hired over great candidates who don't. The only signal in today's hiring process is becoming: can you use AI. It takes a while before noticing that the candidate was simply good at interviewing & getting the job. In a world where teams are becoming smaller & smaller and the world is operating at the speed that it is - hiring the wrong person is already becoming more impactful to companies than it historically has been.

It's clear that in all that noise, we need better ways to produce relevant hiring signal, especially in a world where skill will matter less & less - and intangibles like taste, EQ, adaptability, etc will matter more. These are things you can only reliably get from others who've observed these candidates in their social context.

This is confirmed by all of the hiring managers i've talked to in the past months: they are flooded with (ai-enhanced) applications that make it really hard to find signal - so they're spending more time talking to more people that are often less relevant **(counterintuitive point: getting hiring signal is more expensive, not less with AI)**. They're not interested in tools that can help manage that volume, rather they're interested in how to increase the inflow of the quality of their top of funnel. This leads to a heavy reliance & prioritization of referral programs. These programs are currently fragile & can create more noise than signal if they're not set-up right. They are also relatively slow and dependent on happenstance. So what if you could turn everyone in your network in to a top-notch recruiter with barely any effort on the referrer's part - cast a wider, outbound driven net without loss of signal?

That's what the current pivot is about.
