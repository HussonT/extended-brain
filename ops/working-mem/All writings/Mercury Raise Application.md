Mercury Raise Fundraising Lab  
Mercury Raise Fundraising Lab is a 3-week virtual program built to supercharge first-time, actively fundraising founders through the final stages of the fundraising process. Over 3 weeks, our experts will lead you through live sessions on refining your pitch, expanding your pipeline and closing your round. You'll also have the opportunity to attend office hours with fundraising experts throughout.  

The program is open to pre-seed and seed stage founders in the US, UK and Canada of all industries. You do not need to be a Mercury customer to apply, and your customer status will not affect your application.

Once you've applied, here's what you can expect:

Our panel of judges will review your application based on a set of criteria that reviews your readiness to fundraise. This includes TAM, business model, and idea/solution/technical novelty.  
You'll receive a status update by the first week of September.  
If your application is selected, we’ll follow up with more info on programming and how to get started.

Please provide a short personal bio about your background.  

I'm a 4x founder with an exit in 2022. I've always operated in the talent-tech space with one driving question: "what's the best way to get the right person on the right project for the right reasons?"

- My first startup TMWRK = find people with a specific skills in your vicinity, first focus on handyman stuff.
- My second startup was Perspektiv = an AI-powered talent matching engine for internships used by big IT companies in Belgium.
- That second startup led to those big IT companies asking about the model we'd built and if I could help them build models for internal talent matching. That led to the third company—an agency called [Humain.ai](http://humain.ai/), where we helped big multinationals, BEL20 companies, and big government institutions figure out how to use AI to "get the right person on the right project for the right reasons."

In 2022, at the age of 25, I had grown that agency to 10 people and asked myself, "Is this it?" That's when I decided I wanted to build something with global reach and impact potential—venture-backed. I joined Entrepreneur First, found my co-founder there, and launched Eden Protocol— the peer-validated rolodex optimized for AI-hiring agents with the vision to build the global talent coordination protocol.
