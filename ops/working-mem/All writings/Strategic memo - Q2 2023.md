# How we’re thinking about strategy/tactics at Eden

## And our strategy for the next 3 months

### Context

Strategy is an integrated set of choices that outline how we’re gonna win in whatever market we choose.

A good product strategy answers:

- What’s our winning aspiration
- Where are we going to play
    - What are the markets we’re going after
    - What are the segments of those markets
    - What are the personas of those markets
    - And how are we going to win there?

The questions listed above are guides to help us figure out which hills to take. Deciding which hills we’re going to take, that’s our strategy - how we’re going to take those hills, that’s tactics & actually taking the hills is the execution of that strategy through those tactics.

For us at Eden, there’s a lot of open questions about those questions specifically. This memo aims to make those set of choices explicit - however as with any early stage startup, they are strong convictions - loosely held. We don’t want to over-index on strategy - our focus should be 5% strategy (what are we going after & why), 15% tactics (how are we going after this) & 80% execution (going after it).

## The hills we’re going to take: our 3 month strategy

1. What’s our winning aspiration?
    1. Our long-term mission: build the talent coordination layer for the web.
    2. Our mission for these 3 months: build the talent coordination layer for online communities.
2. Where are we going to play
    1. What market are we going after:
        1. Web3
    2. What are the segments of those markets:
        1. Protocols
        2. Start-ups
        3. DAOs
    3. What are the personas of those markets:
        1. Hiring manager at a Protocol
        2. Web3 startup founder
        3. Committed community/DAO contributor
        4. Curious community/DAO contributor
    4. How are we going to win there - our 3 concrete hills:
        1. Become the most effective community recruiter in web3.
            1. Currently, companies are spending a lot of money on recruiters like Manny from Developer DAO to hand-curate profiles and opportunities. The main reason for this is that many of these communities have a mission affinity with potential candidates, making it more likely to find the perfect hire within their community. By building a tool that can replace these community recruiters, we can tap into each community as a relevant talent source. This playbook can be repeated with any online community that uses Discord, such as DAOs, as well as non-Web3 communities like OpenAI's Discord or even a hackathon Discord that's created for a specific event.
            2. However, in order to test this engine, we need to become one of these community recruiters. If we can 10x outperform all existing recruiters, we may be on to something. From there, we can start thinking about removing the human in the middle altogether.
        2. Make discords/online communities meaningfully searchable for talent
            1. Job-boards like pallet are great to attract active talent - however those are rarely the “best” fits for startup or protocol needs. Both startups & protocols are looking for mission aligned self-starters - those are usually “passive talent”.
            2. There’s a second very important component to this - which is “meaningful”. With meaningful we basically mean “high context & trust”. Basically enough information to start a collaboration & hire somebody through Eden.
        3. Explore all the above erring to the side of fractional work: freelancers, poly-workers, bounty-workers,…
            1. Startups are often cash constrained, web3 offers completely novel ways to reward contributors. If we can enable this we can be a great source for startups to find either subject matter experts that are mission aligned, contractors that can help them get through a couple of important sprints.
            2. On the longer view - one of our beliefs is that the labour force is liquifying. People don’t just have one job - they have multiple. Which puts even more importance on the impact-fullness of the match as the only way to make somebody stay longer (& therefore on the company not lose the context that the person being hired builds up) is by it being the perfect job for them.
