We’re excited to integrate Eden even closer into the TP ecosystem. We’ll be using Eden’s AI interviewer & scoring infra to help build an even robuster, richer & more useful builder score to unlock many new reputation enabled use-cases for the AI-interent.

# What is Eden?

Eden started in 2022 as a discord bot in Developer DAO where you’d tell Eden your skills & interests - and it would match you with builders that have similar interests & complementary skills to work on projects together. From there - Eden evolved into a full blown AI interviewer & Evaluator built to help builders be the right person on the right project for the right reasons.

  

From day 1 - Eden & Talent Protocol shared the vision of better, more effective talent allocation. We both lament the 85% of people emotionally disengaged at work, spam-based lazy recruiting that’s become the industries standard met with a shoulder shrug & “that’s just how it is” as well as the lack of relevant hiring signals that make hiring managers rely on things like where you went to school or what big-tech company you worked at. In short, there’s a lot of work todo to help builders more easily find work they love.

# Why does this matter to the TP-community?

## Our mission: build the talent economy

At talent protocol we believe we can solve a lot of the above mentioned problems by re-imagining what the talent economy looks like. Economies are resource allocation mechanisms and so far they’ve been proven to be the most effective to do this at societal scales.

  

At it’s simplest - we’re building an economy around producing relevant hiring signals, professional reputation if you will, which we at talent protocol have been boiling down to an internet native primitive: **the builder score**. Where in a financial economy your “score-card” is the number in your bank-account, in the talent economy it is the professional reputation, or builder score, you’re able to accrue. Our mission at TP is then simple: make this talent economy & by extension the builder-score the most useful measure to showcase your abilities as builder such that everyone participates in a talent economy that is designed around effective and fruitful talent-allocation.

## Enter Eden: Accelerating the build of the talent economy

Eden improves the talent economy in two ways: talent discovery & qualitative reputation data.

1. **Talent Discovery**
    
    Eden built an AI-interviewer & scoring system that builds what they’ve coined: deep talent profiles. Where LinkedIn is built for people with the attention span of, well people - meaning a one-pager is already a lot, Eden has been building with a vision for the AI-internet.
    
    An AI-agent will take into account as much as you’re willing to tell it, meaning there is much more room for nuance. This paves the way for a world where it is more valuable that you explain how you did something than what logo you have on your one-pager.
    
    These deep talent profiles therefore make discovering the right talent for the right reasons a lot easier. By making this easier - in addition to the reputation data provided by TP, we will be able to unlock many powerful use-cases for our ecosystem.
    
2. **Qualitative reputation data**
    
    Reputation is what other people say about you - until recently, we didn’t have a way to capture this in a system. AI-agents, and specifically the infra that Eden has been building, changes that. Eden’s AI-scoring & interview mechanisms will be the foundation for AI-enabled p2p verification and creation of richer, more qualitative reputation data.
    

Both are crucial in building the talent economy in a way that fits the AI-internet.

# What’s next?

We’re hard at work absorbing everything the team at Eden has built over the last couple of years. We welcome everyone in the Eden ecosystem in the Talent Protocol ecosystem - with a special mention for the Developer DAO & Builders Brunch Club community. To celebrate we’ve made a first version of the AI-interviewer available in your talentpassport so you can start building your Deep Talent Profile in TP. The first 100 to do so will receive 500 TALENT in their wallet!

  

Let’s do this.
