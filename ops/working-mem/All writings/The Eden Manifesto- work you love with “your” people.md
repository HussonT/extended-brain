Life’s too short to spend 1/3 of it doing something you have a hard time getting excited about. And yet, for many of us, the reality is that we live for the weekend or the yearly holidays. 85% of people are emotionally disengaged at work which comes with an estimated 7 trillion USD in lost productivity - not to mention the opportunity cost & loss in global life-satisfaction.

Imagine a talent marketplace that you can sign up for that helps you get work that aligns with your talents & aspirations. You could use it to build up the experience you need to eventually land your dream job or build a modular career to explore the multitudes that you are as a person. A talent marketplace that helps you find those jobs that you are literally the best person in the world for. A talent marketplace that helps you find those companies or projects where you fully feel like you are valued & fully belong.

And on the hiring manager side imagine a talent marketplace that you can plug-in and see as a permanent immediate extension of your current workforce that you can scale up & down as you need them - like the AWS of talent. A talent marketplace with the right accountability mechanics plugged in so you are damn near certain every time that you’ll get someone who’s excited & value aligned to help you accelerate your mission.

We started Eden because we want to shape & enable a better work model. One that’s centred on the simple idea that everyone should get to do work they love with people they admire. The reasons for this are threefold:

  

1. _We_ want this. Not only on a personal level - as founders - are we hugely driven by wanting to do great work with great people, but GenZ is known to quit their job without the next one lined up because work isn’t working for them.
2. It’s now possible. Key global trends like the move towards freelancing (more than 50% of the US workforce is projected to freelance by 2027) & enablers like blockchain & AI maturing make taking this simple idea very seriously possible in a way that it hasn’t previously.
3. Where else should work evolve towards? The days of the 40-year careers rooted in the industrial revolution & taylorism are long gone. Technological advances are making it increasingly possible to work when we want, where we want with whom we want. So why not build a future in which work, works for each and everyone of us instead of the other way around?

  

What would a manifesto be without 7 key-points that are non-negotiable. When you ask us what are the pillars upon which you guys are building that version of the world where everyone gets to do work they love with “their” people - a mix of these elements will always be found in our answer.

## Community at the core

There are 4 key characteristics that make a great career:

1. You like what you do
2. You’re good at what you do
3. You make good money doing it
4. You like the people who you’re doing it with

The magic is in answering those questions from 4 -> 1 instead of from 1 -> 4. Changing who you work with is a lot harder than finding an aspect of work you can enjoy & can get better at.

The key questions to answer in order, are:

1. Where are (my) fascinating people?
2. In what ways can I make money with them?
3. Which ones am I good at?
4. Which ones do I enjoy?

The answer to that first question can be found in communities. We believe that the future of online communities is bright - with more than 50% of the us workforce projected to freelance by 2027, where will they go for mentorship, connection & belonging? Online community already are and will be even more so a huge part of that answer.

## Room to explore

Conviction isn’t found, it is earned. This is also true for finding work you love - it can be hard work to discover what you love. Too many of us settle/get stuck because it is too risky or too hard to keep exploring. In the world of work that we envision, the greater cost is the opportunity cost of doing something you don’t like. We currently have the tools to help everyone explore the different pieces of careers. The first rule of compounding is don’t stop compounding. So that means that you taking the time to find that thing that you’ll be able to keep compounding on in the long-run will cost you less than staying stuck in a job you don’t like for the sake of security.

The model of work that we want to enable builds in that room for exploration through personalised coaching and low switching costs on either side of the employment agreement. This will help you understand whether the path your one is the right one and readjust quickly if it turns out not to be that.

## No middlemen

The role of middlemen in the traditional work model has often created inefficiencies and barriers. We envision a future where middlemen are eliminated. This will allow for direct, transparent, and meaningful connections between individuals and their work. This shift will foster greater individual agency, autonomy, and alignment with personal and professional values.

## Automate meaningless work

In the future of work we envision, meaningless tasks that don't contribute to one's growth or fulfilment, will be automated. Technological advancements like AI and machine learning have the potential to take over mundane tasks, freeing up our time and mental resources. This allows individuals to focus on work that truly matters to them, work that challenges them, allows them to grow and provides a sense of accomplishment. The automation of meaningless work is not just about efficiency, but also about enhancing the quality of work life for everyone.

## Thrive over survive

In the world we envision, people don't just survive in their jobs; they thrive. They are energized by their work, not drained by it. They are excited to start each day and fulfilled at the end of it. This isn't just about being happy at work; it's about being deeply engaged in what you're doing, believing in the mission of your team or company, and feeling that you're contributing to something meaningful. It's about having the freedom to be your best self at work, because when people thrive, companies thrive too.

## Work you love as the ultimate competitive advantage

In the future we envision, people are driven by passion and purpose, not just a paycheck. Doing what you love becomes a powerful competitive advantage. It fosters creativity, innovation, and resilience. It leads to higher levels of engagement, productivity, and satisfaction. And it creates a virtuous cycle where individuals who love their work drive the success and growth of their organizations, which in turn creates more opportunities for meaningful and fulfilling work.

## Building the purpose-led, plugin workforce

We believe that soon, most companies will be no bigger than 10 people and will pull in the right people at the right time for the right reasons. For that to be possible, extraordinary project <> person matching needs to be possible. We’re building that matching capability. This capability will enable a whole new model for work - one where talent enjoys ultimate work-agency & hiring managers attract the most fitting, motivated & engaged people for their projects.
