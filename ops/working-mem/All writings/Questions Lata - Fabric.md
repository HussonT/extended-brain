- **Do people need to opt into Eden or are you scrapping discords/communities where people are “open” to work? How are you incentivising sign ups for Eden if the former?**
    
    The answer is both - we are able to scrape & “triangulate” people’s skills & collaborations, but there’s no point in messaging someone that doesn’t want to be messaged - this would diminish the power of our network.
    
    There’s multiple ways people can and are joining the network:
    
    1. When onboarding to their talent community/DAO: we currently have about 500 people that have signed up through Eden tooling in Developer DAO that doubles as onboarding tooling for developer dao.
    2. timely DMs & Endorsements: by starting in DAOs a lot of people already kind of know of eachother - endorsements are incentives for people to join the network as they get a DM saying something like: “X endorsed you for Y - join Eden & to claim your endorsement and start contributing to epic projects ai-picked for you”
    3. Grants: We have partnerships with protocols such as push, lens, metis & polkadot to distribute grants in DAOs through us. This incentivices contriubtors to build up a reputation in Eden as these grants are “reputation gated” though Eden. So in short, we’re using other protocol’s money to grow our own user base.
    4. There’s many more avenues all centered around friends & collaborators inviting & recognising each-other.
    
- **How do you retain your network of freelance recruiters and talent and what feedback loops do you hope to have in place to effectively create a reputation for them?**
    
    Reputation, community habit & quality of matches are three important retention elements in Eden.
    
    1. reputation: this could be seen as your “SEO” score in the google for talent analogy. This SEO score is built up through many things in the Eden network: from the explicit endorsement/staking to the transactions/collaborations you’re a part of.
    2. community habit: by building Eden as a tool that serves communities to find each-other for collaborations more easily in for example DAOs we can leverage a pre-existing network that has a higher frequency of activation moments that can be leveraged again and again. Our aim is to become the community reflex whenever the community is putting a team together to get anything done.
    3. Quality of matches: our core focus is providing a brilliant talent match. When we consistently deliver on that, this is a reason to keep coming back as you can trust & know that you’ll always find the very best fit for your project.
- **What worked well in private beta? What needs improving**
    
    **Works really well - context:** Our tweaked LLM approach works incredibly well as a huge challenge for a lot of people looking for profiles aren’t exactly sure what they’re looking for. Training our AI to be able to meet anybody where they’re at and being able to serve both the very specific query of a tech lead looking for someone with a very particular python library skill or a founder who’s sort of trying to figure out who they would need to get their idea built - we’re able to engage meaningfully with both.
    
    **Needs work - frontend:** our frontend is very ugly compared to other projects.
    
    A lot remains untested.
    
- **General personas are clear for web3, what’s the personas for web2 equivalents?**
    
    Initially we’ll focus on making DAOs meaningfully searchable for web3 founders. From there the persona transfers pretty easily to a corporate project lead looking to hire an extra expert or team-mate with a particular skillset out of the Eden pool.
    
- **How are you building your pipeline of leads? Can you give an overview of the pipeline so far?**
    
    We’re laser focussed on making the match feel magical in Developer DAO - once that works we’ll focus on building the Eden network to 50k people by focussing on DAOs mostly. We already have 6 communities that we’re starting work with for our private beta.
    
- **How manual is the onboarding process today? How do you plan to automate further?**
    
    All very automatic already tbh. We work with this idea of progressive profiling so the onboarding never truely stops, but this requires no work from the user except for from time to time confirmations on whether the info we’re finding/adding about them is correct and/or if they want this to show up on their profile.
    
- **How dependent do you see yourself on people tying their discord/specific community identity to their socials, GitHub etc?**
    
    Not very - there are many different things that can contribute to your reputational “SEO” score - those are just a couple of many others that we can use. They are however the most obvious & quick impact.
    
- **Are you currently price testing with any customers?**
    
    Not yet as main focus is still on making the match/search feel magical in D_D
    
- **What sets you apart from other alternative platforms recruiting in web3 and how do you intend to keep your edge over time?**
    
    Many other platforms from braintrust to pallet have the same insight that the best talent match on the planet today is a referral & that community is a “referral dense” network - however they are mostly just slapping an incentive layer on top of the open-roles & hopeing that the referral will do the rest. This does not solve the key problem of the referral not being scalable + there is still an incentive misalignment in this model: the referrer is incentivised to find someone who is “just good enough” to fill the role + it is still very expensive. Nobody is going to actively refer or look for somebody for $100. The whole thing is a skeuomorphic approach to leveraging referrals.
    
      
    
    Our view is that referrals are much more complex than that & that a financial incentive is not the main driver of a good referral. We believe therefore the non skeuomorphic question to ask is: what makes a referral great? And that in our view is context & trust. So that’s why we’re designing a network that meaningfully scales context & trust with AI & Blockchain. We believe that in the longrun, our match will be 100x better, cheaper & faster as we focus on the first principles of a referral with this new technology set. We’re shifting the recruitment & staffing paradigm completely. Focussing on this match + being interoperable puts us in a position to be as close to “the moment of need” as possible: for example by building in the way that we are we could integrate with say trello and make suggestions on a per card basis what profiles would be great profiles to hire for that specific task - which is impossible in the passive bounty approach that most competitors are taking.  
      
    There’s multiple moats:  
    
    1. Prop Tech: We both have an AI background & are building proprietary algorithms that will put us ahead of the pack
    2. Network effects: The more people are discoverable through Eden, the more likely you’ll be able to find the person you’re looking for on Eden, the more projects Eden attracts, the more people looking for projects attracts, etc.
    3. Architecture of the company & the tools: It will be very hard to switch to our approach for competitors once they find out that their ability to deliver a great match is capped by other people (recruiters,…) bringing their networks.
    
    Happy to go deeper on this as there’s a lot more to this.
    
- **Do you have any processes in place to improve hiring process beyond initial matching/suggesting talent? E.g interview processes**
    
    Absolutely - the vision is to become the talent coordination layer of the web. We want to replace the entire staffing & recruitment industry.
    
- **Beyond hiring for individual positions ad-hoc, are you looking for any longer term agreements with companies (esp. larger ones) to source multiple people, acquaint recruiters with that companies culture/onboard into the team leads thinking around candidates to ensure more fitting referrals/hires?**
    
    We’re mainly focussed on freelancers, so project <> Person match, not really focussed on longterm hires right now - sorry if that didn’t come across!
    
    in terms of longer term agreements however - by seed we would like to have a “liquid workforce” plugin tool for enterprise that allows them to map their own workforce internally to get the right person in the right place for the right reasons - kind of like we’re doing for the DAO - but then with the ability to click in freelancers from the Eden network.
