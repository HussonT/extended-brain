For some reason I very clearly remember a couple of key first sentences that kicked off important paragraphs in our lives. And as we stand at the beginning of this new chapter - I wanted to revisit a couple of them and then kick off this chapter a bit more thoughtfully than the way I might have kicked off some of our previous chapter.

### From first sentence to brothers

One of the first sentences I ever said to Mattijs was: “I’m so good at drawing”. — which I m not.

So why he thought it was a good idea to befriend a cocky 12-year old is to this day a mystery to me. But I’m glad he did, because soon we’d find ourselves hanging out daily, debating things intensely and on trips to the mountains & the sea where his family very much made feel like I was a part of theirs.

You guys ever felt like that? It’s crazy you feel it in these little moments like at breakfast where it’d be the whole Kempynck clan and me asking to pass the Americain, or how I starting catching to say tuptup because that’s what Thomas, Mattijs dad, called youtube or this other time where I think we were 15 or 16 and Lieve, Mattijs mom, let us off the hook when asked why the room smelled like alcohol in the morning. She let us off the hook or our one-beer argument was oscar-worthy.

I’ve known Mattijs longer than I’ve not known him in my life. And he’s always been one of my first calls when huge things happen in my life. From raising money for my first venture to becoming a dad. Mattijs always picked up which makes me that grateful to be able to be here for his today. In a big way, I grew up with Mattijs - so much so that I truly feel like one of my brothers got married today.

### From first sentence about Bene to marriage

One of the first sentences Mattijs ever said to me about Bene felt different. It was a departure from our usual catch up chats. I left the country after high school but we’d make efforts to call from time to time. As you can imagine - those updates were filled with escapades that I’m told I can’t share here. But what I can tell you is when Mattijs talked about Bene there was a magic to it. This was so intense that without ever having met Bene, I’d kinda fallen in love with her through the way Mattijs was talking about her. So naturally, I was really excited to meet her when I found out she was going to be there for our Christmas dinner with the boys.

One of the first couple of sentences Bene ever said to me were the rules of Pakeleg. For the non-danish people present here today this is a Danish Christmas tradition which foreshadowed this day here in Copenhagen if we’re being real. This was the first time Bene met all the boys - and she decided it was a great idea to bring this tradition into our lives with very detailed & precise instructions. And we were going to like it. She wasn’t wrong. I’ve tried introducing it in our family as a tradition, unsuccessfully. Probably because I lack the danish heritage but mostly the force of nature magic touch with which Bene bamboozled us into it.

  

And eventhough this day

### From first sentence to an extraordinary life together today

Pff and now the moment has arrived. No pressure. The first couple of sentences to you guys as a married couple - what should I say? I was like maybe I give some advice, but I mean - sure coaches don’t play, but not sure I’d have much to teach you guys. I was like maybe I should say something poetic about the incredible partnership you guys have built, but then I was also thinking that I wanted to say how I think both of you’s ability to be uncompromising in the type of life you want to live is inspiring af - which essentially turned into a whole other 30 minute speech. Then I started thinking about how it probably should be something memorable such that we can revist these on the baby shower and bene’s succesful presedential campaign - which also didnt help in terms of pressure. So I decided I’m just going to keep it to the essential and the thing that matters most. My first sentence I’d like to open this chapter with you guys is: I really, truly love you guys. You’re friends that I didnt dare dream of.

So here’s a toast to first sentences that grow into lifelong paragraphs. Skal!

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

So as I was prepping this - I realized that I’ve now put immense pressure on myself because these are essentially my first sentences to you guys as a married couple - which is pretty meta. Figured this is for the rest of our lives now so I wanted to say something that was memorable - like something that I can hopefully refer to when we do you guys’ baby shower, and then bene’s successful presidential campaign.

So know that I know I’m doing it I wanted to be thoughtful about it and I wanted to workshop a couple with you guys try them out see how you guys react to them and then we can like settle on one together you know

“You sure?”

“Marriage is like a long walk on the beach – full of sand and seagulls.”

“My therapist says your relationship triggers my avoidant issues.”

“Quick heads-up, I’m raising a seed round for my AI wedding-speech platform. Minimum ticket five-grand—any takers?”

I love you, and watching you two turn first sentences into a shared story is my favourite plot twist.”

Mattijs & Bene, I love you guys so much. I’m so excited to keep being a witness & participate in the life that you guys now have chosen to build together.

You guys inspire me in so many ways. Who you are as individuals: warm, loyal, smart, hot, kind, caring not to be fucked with forces of nature. True community pillars. Principled, get your hands dirty world improvers.

But also who you are as a couple: true partners who somehow figure out to make it all work on their own terms. Mattijs single handedly defending our EU markets from the Chinese dumpers & US bullies while Bene runs for president of the universe. As if that’s not enough, you are now the proud owners of two apartments in two of europe’s gem cities. AND you still have time for friends and family. That’s not possible without true partnership. So inspiring. It’s insane. You guys have set the bar for the kind of partnership I want, which is probably also the reason I’m still single.

As this day is about a first, and should be a last - don’t screw this up you both. There’s a couple of repeats I’d like to speak into existence for you guys. First, more ski-trips with me. We should aim for two each year. Second - that’s it actually. I don’t know much about marriage you guys will have to tell me but I guess what I’m saying is I’ll be very excited to have both of you in my life, forever.

So here’s a toast to first sentences that grow into lifelong paragraphs.

I love you both very much. Skal!
