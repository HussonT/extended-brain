Where were you living before the city you are living in now?

- Miltiadis Saratzidis: London, UK
- Tom Husson: London, UK

  
Why did you move from where you were living and why did you choose where you are living now?  

- We moved to the UK as it was touted as the ideal startup-city in Europe with the main arguments being access to capital & ambitious talent. What they don’t mention is how easy it is to get “productively” distracted by feeling like you should be at every VC or industry meet-up event to meet potential clients, talent or investors. This also means that it’s easy to get caught up in a signaling game rather than focussing on something people want. Also the city is very expensive, so a higher burn is just the price you were supposed to pay for that access.
- The reality is that everything can very well be done remote these days - top talent often also wants that complete flexibility - which is strike one for the main argument for London. Strike two was that most VC’s prefer a video call as a first meeting these days over an in person meeting when you’ve got a pitch worth chatting over + it’s perfectly feasible to move out to the city for a couple of months when raising - you don’t need the constant distraction. Strike three was that we were paying double the rent for just staying in our apartment & being heads down building.
- The insight we share with brickyard vc is that there are no shortcuts, only lucky breaks - especially in the beginning of a startup. And that luck is found in an attitude of hard work & focus. That is something we can find here in Chattanooga, with easy access to nature to ground ourselves, away from all the distractions. Brickyard has created what has been called “the bermuda triangle of hard work” which - in our view - will spawn a counter movement of the “instagram founders” that mainly play a signalling game and fail to realise the true value of what they set out to build.

  
How much of a factor was the cost of living, particularly housing?  

- This was definitely a factor for us. As a very young startup you want to have as many shots on goal as possible to tweaking a product that the market really wants. That means stretching every dollar in the most impactful way possible. Housing & environment are crucial for this.

  
What do you miss from where you used to live?  

- The networking events are a bit like refined sugar - in the moment they feel good, give you a jolt of energy - but in the long run, if you’re not mindful & intentional about when & how you indulge in them, they’re bound to kill you. So we miss the “I-just-met-this-bigshot” rushes of excitement, but we also realise that those are not what are going to make our startup succeed.

  
What do you like about where you live now?  

- The nature, the people, the dedicated support & interest from city officials, the “rooting for you atmosphere” - in the big city it all feels a lot more competitive & cut-throat. What we especially love is the little “campus” that the guys from brickyard have been able to create - bringing together world class founders from all over the world that are all here to build. So we really get the best of both worlds.
