# Telepathic lets SaaS companies evolve their UI to AI with their AI-first UX analytics suite.

## The standard for human-machine interaction is changing. Telepathic is here to make sure you’re building the right AI-experiences, right.

  

Companies like Amplitude, Mixpanel & even Google Analytics have played a key role in shaping software as we know it today in the past decade. The next paradigm has arrived and it’s AI-first-user-experiences. When you’ve experienced perplexity’s search experience it becomes hard to revert back to clunky google searches. This will be a reality for most products. Instead of competing on UI enabled user experience, product will be competing on the quality of their AI-experience. That means that tracking things like rage-clicks, views & bounce-rates are obsolete ways of measuring how great your product is. We need a new vocabulary & set of tools. That’s telepathic.

  

Current product-analytic tools are inadequate to help software companies build for the age of AI-experiences. We need a whole new vocabulary, metrics & way to measure the quality of the experience our users are having. The best AI experiences give you exactly what you want, when you need it. In terms of basic product metrics this means making the effectiveness of a users’ intent-to-action loop, measurable. This is impossible to accurately measure from observing rage-clicks, views or bounces.

  

Telepathic helps SaaS businesses establish, evolve & optimise their AI-first UX with a set of analytics tools that make it possible to capture & analyse a users’ intent-to-action effectiveness. At the heart of it all is a light-weight overlay widget that runs in your SaaS product & can instantly answer any product question a user has, visually. Users of your SaaS product can literally say what they’re trying to get done to the widget & the widget shows them how to do it. By having an AI answer product questions of users into product walkthrough we can capture everything we need to understand what the intent of the user is & if the current version of the product is serving that need. At scale - these intent-to-action loops point the way to the AI-experiences you should build first.

  

After installing the telepathic bot, it maps your entire SaaS product. It does this at regular intervals to capture all product changes. From this map, it can translate any question a user has to a visual, personalised product walk-through that answers their question. Users provide live-feedback on whether their intent was correctly captured & translated to a set of actions without ever having to leave the app.

> Not only did our customer support tickets drop overnight - we’ve had insights around the gap between what our users intent to do on our platform versus what they’re actually getting done that even our best User Researchers weren’t able to catch.
