# Vouch-to-earn: hiring-startup Eden lets you earn by vouching for your smartest friends & colleagues.

## Eden Protocol is on a mission to help us all find work we love with people we like through an ecosystem of trustworthy AI-hiring agents that match talent and opportunities with more depth than anything that exists today.

  

Eden let’s you vouch for your friends & colleagues in a 3-step vouching process that includes a 7-min AI-vouching-interview. In return for helping provide rich & meaningful information about your colleague you receive Eden’s $APLAYER tokens + the chance at a piece of the hiring bounty if your vouchee ends up getting hired. This information is then used by the AI-agents to improve its matching on both the talent & opportunity side.

  

In order to build trustworthy AI-hiring-agents that help us find work we love, Eden needs rich, validated talent-data. A vouch is such a piece of rich, peer-validated data. However, asking people to vouch for you can be an awkward experience despite numerous studies proving that getting vouched for has a huge effect on the quality of matching. Additionally, simply paying somebody to vouch for you makes the experience transactional - which hurts the vouch-credibility & takes away the social capital exchange that is the true driver of great vouching.

  

Eden makes it fun & easy to get vouched for without it becoming a purely transactional interaction. Staked, weighted vouching works by having colleagues & friends take a 7-min AI interview that lets them detail how they’ve worked with you in the past, what they believe is amazing about you & also asks about where you could grow. Then, they stake $APLAYER tokens to show their conviction in you. When you are the one that ends up getting hired, they receive double their $APLAYER stake back & a weighted piece of the hiring bounty in cash. The weight of the bounty is determined by how relevant your profile & vouch was in helping the AI surface the talent to the hiring manager & how relevant it was to the decision calculated by our eigen-relevance score. By turning vouching into a talent prediction market with an uncertain outcome it removes the transactional nature of it, kind of like how a VC signs up to back a founder for 10 years. For neither the results are guaranteed, yet incentives are aligned.

And if they win, you win & you guys can go celebrate with the piece of the hiring bounty you’ll have helped unlock!

  

> In the world of AI the power of a human backing another human cannot be underestimated. Things like a cover letter & resume that used to be relevant hiring signals became AI-optimised documents with little to no meaning. Eden’s weighted, staked vouching gives so much credible context that we’ve started hiring exclusively through them.
