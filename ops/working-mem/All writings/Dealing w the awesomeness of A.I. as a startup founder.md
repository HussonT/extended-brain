# Captatio Benevolentiae

I'm not going to lie - I've been cycling through minor episodes of existential angst and elation over the last couple of months. It's both exciting and terrifying to have some of the most impactful technologies ever known to humankind at our fingertips. There's no doubt about it - the times, they are a-changin'. However, we humans are not biologically wired for these exponentially accelerating change times. And yet, here we are.

In this video, I share my specific ways of dealing with both the exciting features to build and the sometimes overwhelming feelings of intense competition and uncertainty that come with these changes as an early stage startup founder. I would love to hear your ideas here as well.

# The overwhelming side

I’ve come across three types of overwhelm so far: incumbent induced overwhelm, comparison induced overwhelm & then just the sheer speed of the tech and whether any of it still makes any sense at all when the robots will take over anyway. That last bit I won’t dive into in this video lol but the other two I do want to dive deeper on.

Let me start with the incumbent induced overwhelm: There are so many startups that die or have to aggressively pivot when a big corporation like microsoft, google or adobe release a new feature. And since they have better distribution they are almost certain to kill you if your whole company was to bet on a marginal improvement to some of the core products of these giants. The way I manage this is by maximising the "innovators dilemma" play & choosing a set of alternative basis vectors to what these big corpos are working on.

To fully explain what I mean by all that would turn this video in a 30 min video so let me explain the gist of it with a video of a tiger and a duck:  the main question I'm constantly asking is - where can I go that a big corporation can't? For Eden that translates to focussing on very specific niche's and discovering & solving very niche specific problems a 100x better than big corpos' could - because they have an inverse pressure. If they'd started focussing on serving very specific niche's, they'd need to neglect a big part of their other business - which they just won't do. Just like this tiger & the duck - this duck can go where the tiger can't reach for it fast enough. Do that enough times, the tiger might get tired & leave you alone - and lo & behold. You survive.

The tricky part for us, I find, is having the dicipline to go after an initially seemingly small niche - especially bc the technology is so awesome and there are so many possibilities. For that we use an internal mantra at Eden: Startups don't die of starvation, they die of indigestion. That tends to keep us somewhat in the reflex of saying no more often than we say yes.

When it comes to managing all the "noise" of other startups doing similar things raising bigger rounds than us -
