# EOSM1: dynamic score-topic mapping

100% matches do not exist, if you can’t explain why someone is a match for your org you’ve got nothing. This is where most of the work is - keywords are very low bandwidth when it comes to understanding the match-story. This is why the “oh shit” moment comes from our ability to let hiring managers set any score-topics they care about in natural language & have the relevant pieces of information for each talent be mapped with a relevance score as this is a lot higher “story-bandwidth”.

# EOSM2: eden’s AI as a toughtful talent-partner

The main deliverable for a recruiter is a set of profiles with a relatively good set of reasons/story as to why they are worth talking to. The better the recruiter understands the hiring manager, the better the reasons/story can gel. A second “oh shit” moment happens when a hiring manager goes through the effort of setting up their opportunity because the AI asks them very relevant questions that make them think about the role better & refine what & who exactly it is they’re looking for.

# EOSM3: score-topic based search

Hiring managers that are interested to find hidden gems are looking for a very particular proof that often they believe are indicators that they’re a hidden gem - kind of like investors that have a set of belief around what makes a good founder. The idea that Eden lets them search talent in natural language based on those beliefs is super exciting to them because this could mean they can turn their belief into a talent edge instead of all going after the same fish.

# EOSM4: creating talent visibility

The communities that are currently using Eden (Myosin & Developer DAO) + the ones that I’m talking too are mostly interested in understanding the talent that’s in their community.

# EOSM5: community talent monetisation

From the moment that they get the talent key idea - community owners/influencers are super excited about the idea of owning their community’s talent keys. The problem is that it is a bit of a new paradigm & even for web3 communities it takes some time to understand how exaclty this is useful.
