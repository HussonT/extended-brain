# Weekly Review - Week 31, 2025 (Aug 4-10)

## üéØ Top 3 Priorities This Week
1. **Fine-tune PLG for Telepathic** - Get maximum users testing, gather feedback, implement improvements before website launch
2. **Revive Found Finding Founders Club** - Build out the brand and re-engage the community
3. **Host friend dinner** - Organize and host a relaxed dinner with friends

## üìä Weekly Goals

### Professional
- [ ] Get 5+ people to sign up through PLG funnel
- [ ] Collect structured feedback from each PLG user
- [ ] Implement at least 3 high-impact improvements based on feedback
- [ ] Create content plan for Fine Finding Founders Club revival
- [ ] Reach out to 10 potential members/participants for FFFC
- [ ] Set up tracking/analytics for PLG conversions

### Personal Development
- [ ] Finish article draft for friends
- [ ] Send article to at least 3 friends for initial feedback
- [ ] Read/learn something about PLG best practices (even 30 min helps)

### Health & Wellness
- [ ] Gym session #1 (specify day: ________)
- [ ] Gym session #2 (specify day: ________)
- [ ] Swimming session (specify day: ________)
- [ ] One morning walk/stretch session (low commitment, high reward)

### Relationships
- [ ] Send dinner invites by Tuesday
- [ ] Confirm attendees by Thursday
- [ ] Plan simple menu (don't overcomplicate)
- [ ] Text one friend you haven't talked to in a while

## üìà Success Metrics
*What does success look like this week?*
- **5+ PLG signups with documented feedback from each**
- **Fine Finding Founders Club has clear next steps and momentum**
- **Friend dinner scheduled with 4+ confirmed attendees**
- **Article sent to friends for feedback**
- **Completed 2 gym + 1 swim session**

## üöß Potential Blockers
*What might prevent progress?*
- PLG feedback might reveal major issues requiring more time than expected
- Summer schedules might make friend dinner coordination tricky
- Energy split between Telepathic and FFFC could dilute focus

## üí≠ Additional Suggestions/Challenges
**Consider adding:**
- **PLG Documentation** - Create a simple feedback template/form to standardize what you're learning
- **FFFC Quick Win** - What's ONE thing you could ship this week to show FFFC is back? (newsletter, post, event announcement?)
- **Networking Goal** - While reviving FFFC, identify 2-3 potential collaborators or advisors
- **PLG Metric Tracking** - Beyond signups: activation rate? Time to first value? Where do people drop off?

**Questions to consider:**
- What specific feedback are you looking for from PLG users? (having clear questions will get better insights)
- What does "revive" mean for FFFC? Restart from scratch or build on what existed?
- Could the friend dinner double as informal user testing for either project?
