# Monday, August 18, 2025

## üéØ Today's Intention
**ONE thing that makes today a win:** Get feedback from Telepathic team and friends on the onboarding flow

## üìã Today's Focus Tasks

### Must Do:
- [x] Schedule and complete at least 5 test calls (4 completed - good sample size)
- [x] Record all calls for transcript/feedback documentation
- [ ] ~~Start Framer integration groundwork~~ ‚Üí Pivoted to roadmap planning based on feedback

### Would Be Nice:
- [x] Document initial feedback patterns ‚Üí Led to roadmap creation

## ‚è∞ Time Blocks

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Now-12:00 | **Telepathic Test Calls** - Onboarding feedback (Target: 5 calls) |
| 12:00-14:00 | Lunch + Document morning feedback |
| 14:00-16:00 | **Deep Work:** Framer Integration Groundwork |
| 16:00-17:30 | Continue calls or Framer work as needed |
| 17:30-18:00 | **Syndicate One:** Send pivot update message |
| After 18:00 | Personal work (content editing/resume update) |

## ü§ù Commitments & Promises

### To Others:
- **Telepathic team:** Framer integration by end of week
- **Syndicate One:** Update on andwho pivot (draft today, send Monday)

### To Self:
- Maintain 6pm boundary for personal work

### Syndicate One Message Draft:
- Key points to cover:
  - Pivot from andwho to focus on Telepathic
  - Career transition plans
  - Gratitude for support

## üåô Evening Reflection

**Wins:**
- Got 4 high-quality test calls with valuable feedback
- Discovered better planning methodology that will accelerate progress
- Marketing/vision jam session was energizing and played to strengths
- Maintained 6pm boundary successfully
- 100% say-do gap on actual commitments

**Challenges:**
- Realizing I'm not playing to my strengths (storyteller forced into pure dev work)
- Feeling burnt out on startup/technical implementation
- Energy depleted by technical work vs energized by vision/marketing

**Key Insights:**
- "I am not a fullblown developer even though I am working as one - I don't really care that much about getting things technically right as long as the story I'm telling makes sense and comes out correctly"
- Marketing, vision, and storytelling are energy-givers
- Strategic pivot from Framer to roadmap was the right call based on feedback
- Underpromised on revamp timeline (2 days when can probably do in 1)

**Tomorrow's Priority:**
- PLG revamp v1 based on feedback (replacing Framer integration)
- 20 outreach messages
- Follow up with Syndicate One person who reached out
