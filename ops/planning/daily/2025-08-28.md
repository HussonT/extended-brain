# Thursday, August 28, 2025

## üîó Weekly Context
[[Week 35, 2025]] - **PROVING WEEK**

## üéØ Morning Intention
**ONE THING:** Get working Google CLI demo completed

*"Be so good they can't ignore you. Be so strategic they can't afford to lose you."*

## ‚úÖ Today's Focus Tasks

### Must Do
- [x] Complete reading during Uber ride to Constellation
- [x] Get working Google CLI demo completed (partial - got it somewhat working)
- [x] Develop Google CLI workflow for faster future demos (AI-powered workflow in progress)

### Would Be Nice
- [x] Start outlining Watertight vision doc (made some progress)

## ‚è∞ Time Blocks
- **Morning (Uber):** Deep reading session
- **Day (Constellation):** Meetings + quick work sessions between
- **Evening (after 6pm):** Deep work on Google CLI demo

## üí≠ Meeting Notes & Thoughts
*Space for capturing insights from Constellation meetings*

---

## üìù Evening Reflection
*To complete at end of day*

### What Got Done?
- Completed reading during Uber ride
- Got Google CLI demo partially working
- Set up AI-powered workflow for efficiency
- Made progress on Watertight vision doc
- Learned bash fundamentals

### What Didn't Get Done?
- Full completion of Google CLI demo (got stuck in bash rabbit hole)
- Got bogged down in low-leverage work instead of focusing on the needle-mover

### Key Learnings
- **Critical insight:** Recognizing when stuck in "just one more thing" loop - need to step back and ask "Is this the highest leverage work?"
- The drive to finish something can trap me in low-signal work
- This pattern has killed companies before - can't let it happen again
- My quit/grit calibration is right (I know Google CLI is key) but execution drifted

### Tomorrow's Priority
- **ONE THING:** Complete Google CLI demos - NO DISTRACTIONS
- This is the needle-mover for Watertight job confirmation

## üìä Progress Tracking
- Energy maintained: [x] High (especially ending with high energy/excitement)
- ONE thing completed: [x] Partial (got CLI somewhat working)
- Promises kept: [x] Some (improved workflow but still got stuck)
