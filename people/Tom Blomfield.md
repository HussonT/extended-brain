# Key Message

I’m a YC backable founder when ready

# Likely questions:

Tell me about yourself.

- 4x founder (1 small exit), Computer Science bg + love for sales & marketing.
- Sold my innovation agency in 2021 because I wanted a way to have a bigger impact & felt stipled by belgian context. One of my 3 life goals is to learn what it takes to positively impact a billion+ people's lives through tech and foundership.
- I've since successfully raised a pre-seed for, Eden (my current project). Unfortunately, my previous co-founder had to take a step back, and since I truly believe that it is team>market>product in that order, I'm here to look for someone who is just as excited as I am to learn what it takes to impact a billion+ people's lives.
- Currently in a founder residency called Brickyard ([https://justlaybrick.com](https://justlaybrick.com/)) in Chattanooga, and I would love to have u over!

What is your company working on?

- I’m in a position where I need money to get to the next milestone but won’t be able to becaue I didn’t make enough progress.
- I’ve offered to return the capital, but they are fully onboard with me exploring pivots - so I’m spending half of my time validating business ideas, the other half I’m working with potential co-founders.

  

What have you been working on?

- Spent the last 1,5 years working on Eden: essentially a database of verified talent built for the AI hiring agent future.

Why didn’t it work?

- wrong beach-head market
- too vision led - we were building something that people will want, not necessarily what they want today
- bit of an early/ tartpit idea if im totally honest

  

What are you doing now?

- Currently spending half of my time collaborating with potential co-founders & 50% of my time validating potential business ideas.
